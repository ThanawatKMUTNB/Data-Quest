Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me! Chameleon   2014 Sep 17, 00:00 31 comments                 anime    This little-seen delinquent comedy, an early ADV release, made Justin want to hurt himself. ―  Bite Me! Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F. Fujio's famous magical large blue cat character who's the star of over 2500 episodes of TV anime and 35 movies (not including short...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Guyver: Out of Control   2014 Jun 11, 03:43 18 comments                 anime    A mildly entertaining, but super-dated OAV incarnation of everyone's favorite superhero/grotesque monster/schoolboy. ―  Guyver: Out of Control Guyver: Out of Control was one of the earliest anime VHS releases in the US, and being an alternate retelling of the same story that the same company, US Renditions, would later release in dubbed form, was one of the first titles to confuse the hell out of peo...                    column          45 comments       Pile of Shame - Full Moon O Sagashite   2014 May 28, 00:00 45 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look back at the oddball Magical-Idol-Singer-With-Cancer Show from the early '00s. Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work. Others take it...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Nitaboh   2014 Apr 16, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    One of the few anime biographies, Nitaboh is surprisingly formulaic for being a true story. ―  Nitaboh, The Shamisen Master Last year, an old friend of mine asked me to help a non-profit group of radio producers come up with a Kickstarter video for a public radio project called ""Heavenly Sight,"" a multi-part audio documentary and web resource on blind African American blues and jazz musicians. It was...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo)   2014 Apr  2, 00:00 18 comments                 anime    A non-hentai show from hentai producers that somehow nobody remembers, despite getting two dubs. There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English. I lay blame for that mostly in his ...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun   2014 Mar  5, 02:24 23 comments                 anime    Isao Takahata's troubled first feature is easily the best anime of the 1960s. ―  Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun It's the iron age, somewhere in Scandinavia, and a young boy warrior named Hols is just coming back home from a fierce battle with a pack of wolves. His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we. In the front seat a...                    column          14 comments       Pile of Shame - Natsuki Crisis   2014 Feb  5, 01:00 14 comments                 anime    A fun two-part girls-fighting-in-high-school OAV that doesn't take itself too seriously... until it does. ―  Natsuki Crisis When we first meet Kitsumi Natsuki, she's in her school dojo, gleefully trying to find a sparring partner. The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody. Luckily by this time, humanity had a pretty decent settlement going on the moon, and once thin...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - After School Tinker Bell   2014 Jan  8, 01:00 23 comments                 anime    This week, an OAV based on a light novel series about a romantic couple that solves mysteries around their school. ―  After School Tinker Bell In the last few years there have been a ton of anime adapted from light novels: those small, pulpy, simply written and easy-to-read populist books that lie somewhere between young adult novels and manga. But light novels have been around for a very long time, ...                    column          12 comments       Pile of Shame - Handsome Girl   2013 Dec 25, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    Justin revisits an old one-shot OAV by the creator of Marmalade Boy... and is a little underwhelmed. ―  Handsome Girl When I was in high school, I loved the show Marmalade Boy. A lot. In fact, I wrote an article about it! A perfectly addictive confectionary of chaste teenaged yearning and romance, and undiluted raw crippling angst, I lost many an evening to the adventures of the lovelorn protagonists...                    column          11 comments       Pile of Shame - The Sensualist   2013 Dec 11, 02:10 11 comments                 anime    This week, a unique erotic historical fiction film that has completely slipped through the cracks. ―  The Sensualist (A.K.A. The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty. It felt like a piece of another person's life, so fo...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - Emblem Take 2   2013 Nov 27, 02:02 16 comments                 anime    This week, a rare yakuza time travel comedy. Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing. Unless you go looking for trouble in Tokyo, it's unlikely that a...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame: Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories   2013 Nov 13, 01:13 17 comments                 anime    Trying to watch this OAV like biting into a large wad of wet cotton: it's not offensive or unpleasant, but you want to end the experience as fast as humanly possible. ―  Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories If there's anything that anime lacks, it's real, adult love stories. We have enough yearning, angsty teen romance to sink a battleship, but realistic love stories about people whose frontal lobes are fir...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Wanna-Be's   2013 Oct 30, 00:01 23 comments     Did anyone say ""I want more women's wrestling anime?"" .... No? Didn't think so. ―  Wanna-Be's Lately there's been a lot of chatter about the girls' wrestling TV series, Wanna Be The Strongest In The World. Given that virtually none of the chatter is positive, I'm not really making plans to check out the show for myself. But hearing about a mediocre girls' wresting anime did jog my memory about anothe...                    column          5 comments       Pile of Shame - Grandeek: The Alternative   2013 Sep 18, 00:56 5 comments                 anime    An early digipaint OAV that has a lot of potential, but is so awkwardly made that the storytelling really suffers. ―  Grandeek: The Alternative When visiting Japan, one of my favorite things to do is explore the DVD sections of every Book Off location I can find. Usually I can identify and easily dismiss pretty much everything on the shelf, but every once in a while I happen upon something that I hav...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman   2013 Sep  4, 00:00 17 comments                 anime                manga    It could've been offensive, bawdy, witty and hilarious. Instead, it's just sort of lazy and crappy. ―  Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman One thing you can say about Butt Attack Girl Punisher Gautaman (and its sequel OAV, Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman R), you know pretty much exactly what you're getting: a cut-rate early-90s dirty comedy OAV about a girl that beats dudes down with her butt. It o...                    column          43 comments       Pile of Shame - Yagami-kun's Family Affairs   2013 Aug 21, 00:08 43 comments                 anime    This week, a slapstick comedy OAV from 1990 that's all about incest. ―  Yagami-kun's Family Affairs Remember when incest was shocking? I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god."" You can tell what we used to be like by going up to your...                    column          28 comments       Pile of Shame - Moshidora   2013 Aug  7, 02:32 28 comments                 anime    Only Japan would attempt to take a business management textbook and turn it into a high school sports story. ―  Moshidora When I first heard the premise behind Moshidora, which is short for a ridiculously long title that translates to, ""What If the Girl Manager of a High School Baseball Team Read Drucker's 'Management?'"" I believe I laughed and said, ""Oh, Japan."" Because really, what other response i...                    column          22 comments       Pile of Shame - Kenya Boy   2013 Jul 24, 01:00 22 comments                 anime    Adjectives fail Justin has he tries to describe the absolute insanity contained in a 1984 feature film retelling of a popular 1950s manga series. ― One of the benefits to writing a column on obscure anime for so long is that occasionally friends hand you things that they think would inspire a good column.

That thought occurred to me again and again while I was watching Colorful, the remarkable feature film produced by Sunrise in 2010,...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - SOS!

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me! Chameleon   2014 Sep 17, 00:00 31 comments                 anime    This little-seen delinquent comedy, an early ADV release, made Justin want to hurt himself. ―  Bite Me! Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F. Fujio's famous magical large blue cat character who's the star of over 2500 episodes of TV anime and 35 movies (not including short...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Guyver: Out of Control   2014 Jun 11, 03:43 18 comments                 anime    A mildly entertaining, but super-dated OAV incarnation of everyone's favorite superhero/grotesque monster/schoolboy. ―  Guyver: Out of Control Guyver: Out of Control was one of the earliest anime VHS releases in the US, and being an alternate retelling of the same story that the same company, US Renditions, would later release in dubbed form, was one of the first titles to confuse the hell out of peo...                    column          45 comments       Pile of Shame - Full Moon O Sagashite   2014 May 28, 00:00 45 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look back at the oddball Magical-Idol-Singer-With-Cancer Show from the early '00s. Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work. Others take it...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Nitaboh   2014 Apr 16, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    One of the few anime biographies, Nitaboh is surprisingly formulaic for being a true story. ―  Nitaboh, The Shamisen Master Last year, an old friend of mine asked me to help a non-profit group of radio producers come up with a Kickstarter video for a public radio project called ""Heavenly Sight,"" a multi-part audio documentary and web resource on blind African American blues and jazz musicians. It was...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo)   2014 Apr  2, 00:00 18 comments                 anime    A non-hentai show from hentai producers that somehow nobody remembers, despite getting two dubs. There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English. I lay blame for that mostly in his ...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun   2014 Mar  5, 02:24 23 comments                 anime    Isao Takahata's troubled first feature is easily the best anime of the 1960s. ―  Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun It's the iron age, somewhere in Scandinavia, and a young boy warrior named Hols is just coming back home from a fierce battle with a pack of wolves. His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we. In the front seat a...                    column          14 comments       Pile of Shame - Natsuki Crisis   2014 Feb  5, 01:00 14 comments                 anime    A fun two-part girls-fighting-in-high-school OAV that doesn't take itself too seriously... until it does. ―  Natsuki Crisis When we first meet Kitsumi Natsuki, she's in her school dojo, gleefully trying to find a sparring partner. The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody. Luckily by this time, humanity had a pretty decent settlement going on the moon, and once thin...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - After School Tinker Bell   2014 Jan  8, 01:00 23 comments                 anime    This week, an OAV based on a light novel series about a romantic couple that solves mysteries around their school. ―  After School Tinker Bell In the last few years there have been a ton of anime adapted from light novels: those small, pulpy, simply written and easy-to-read populist books that lie somewhere between young adult novels and manga. But light novels have been around for a very long time, ...                    column          12 comments       Pile of Shame - Handsome Girl   2013 Dec 25, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    Justin revisits an old one-shot OAV by the creator of Marmalade Boy... and is a little underwhelmed. ―  Handsome Girl When I was in high school, I loved the show Marmalade Boy. A lot. In fact, I wrote an article about it! A perfectly addictive confectionary of chaste teenaged yearning and romance, and undiluted raw crippling angst, I lost many an evening to the adventures of the lovelorn protagonists...                    column          11 comments       Pile of Shame - The Sensualist   2013 Dec 11, 02:10 11 comments                 anime    This week, a unique erotic historical fiction film that has completely slipped through the cracks. ―  The Sensualist (A.K.A. The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty. It felt like a piece of another person's life, so fo...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - Emblem Take 2   2013 Nov 27, 02:02 16 comments                 anime    This week, a rare yakuza time travel comedy. Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing. Unless you go looking for trouble in Tokyo, it's unlikely that a...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame: Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories   2013 Nov 13, 01:13 17 comments                 anime    Trying to watch this OAV like biting into a large wad of wet cotton: it's not offensive or unpleasant, but you want to end the experience as fast as humanly possible. ―  Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories If there's anything that anime lacks, it's real, adult love stories. We have enough yearning, angsty teen romance to sink a battleship, but realistic love stories about people whose frontal lobes are fir...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Wanna-Be's   2013 Oct 30, 00:01 23 comments     Did anyone say ""I want more women's wrestling anime?"" .... No? Didn't think so. ―  Wanna-Be's Lately there's been a lot of chatter about the girls' wrestling TV series, Wanna Be The Strongest In The World. Given that virtually none of the chatter is positive, I'm not really making plans to check out the show for myself. But hearing about a mediocre girls' wresting anime did jog my memory about anothe...                    column          5 comments       Pile of Shame - Grandeek: The Alternative   2013 Sep 18, 00:56 5 comments                 anime    An early digipaint OAV that has a lot of potential, but is so awkwardly made that the storytelling really suffers. ―  Grandeek: The Alternative When visiting Japan, one of my favorite things to do is explore the DVD sections of every Book Off location I can find. Usually I can identify and easily dismiss pretty much everything on the shelf, but every once in a while I happen upon something that I hav...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman   2013 Sep  4, 00:00 17 comments                 anime                manga    It could've been offensive, bawdy, witty and hilarious. Instead, it's just sort of lazy and crappy. ―  Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman One thing you can say about Butt Attack Girl Punisher Gautaman (and its sequel OAV, Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman R), you know pretty much exactly what you're getting: a cut-rate early-90s dirty comedy OAV about a girl that beats dudes down with her butt.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

I believe I laughed and said, ""Oh, Japan."" Because really, what other response i...                    column          22 comments       Pile of Shame - Kenya Boy   2013 Jul 24, 01:00 22 comments                 anime    Adjectives fail Justin has he tries to describe the absolute insanity contained in a 1984 feature film retelling of a popular 1950s manga series. ― One of the benefits to writing a column on obscure anime for so long is that occasionally friends hand you things that they think would inspire a good column.

Pile of Shame FINAL: Chie the Brat The Pile of Shame recedes into the mists of history with one final installment, on Isao Takahata's criminally underseen Chie the Brat.  « »     Pile of Shame        — Archives —                  Filters          All Southeast Asia  •  Anime Manga Novels Games Music Merch Events Industry People Live-Action COVID-19           Text-only Compact View             Text-only List View             Text-only Grid View             List View with Images             Grid View with Images                               column          39 comments       Pile of Shame - Colorful   2014 Nov 12, 01:00 39 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at an understated art house drama anime from a few years ago, and finds a lot to admire. ―  COLORFUL To paraphrase Hideaki Anno, people don't commit suicide because they're depressed, people commit suicide because they can no longer imagine happiness. That thought occurred to me again and again while I was watching Colorful, the remarkable feature film produced by Sunrise in 2010,...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - SOS!

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me! Chameleon   2014 Sep 17, 00:00 31 comments                 anime    This little-seen delinquent comedy, an early ADV release, made Justin want to hurt himself. ―  Bite Me! Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F. Fujio's famous magical large blue cat character who's the star of over 2500 episodes of TV anime and 35 movies (not including short...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Guyver: Out of Control   2014 Jun 11, 03:43 18 comments                 anime    A mildly entertaining, but super-dated OAV incarnation of everyone's favorite superhero/grotesque monster/schoolboy. ―  Guyver: Out of Control Guyver: Out of Control was one of the earliest anime VHS releases in the US, and being an alternate retelling of the same story that the same company, US Renditions, would later release in dubbed form, was one of the first titles to confuse the hell out of peo...                    column          45 comments       Pile of Shame - Full Moon O Sagashite   2014 May 28, 00:00 45 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look back at the oddball Magical-Idol-Singer-With-Cancer Show from the early '00s. Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work. Others take it...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Nitaboh   2014 Apr 16, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    One of the few anime biographies, Nitaboh is surprisingly formulaic for being a true story. ―  Nitaboh, The Shamisen Master Last year, an old friend of mine asked me to help a non-profit group of radio producers come up with a Kickstarter video for a public radio project called ""Heavenly Sight,"" a multi-part audio documentary and web resource on blind African American blues and jazz musicians. It was...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo)   2014 Apr  2, 00:00 18 comments                 anime    A non-hentai show from hentai producers that somehow nobody remembers, despite getting two dubs. There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English. I lay blame for that mostly in his ...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun   2014 Mar  5, 02:24 23 comments                 anime    Isao Takahata's troubled first feature is easily the best anime of the 1960s. ―  Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun It's the iron age, somewhere in Scandinavia, and a young boy warrior named Hols is just coming back home from a fierce battle with a pack of wolves. His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we. In the front seat a...                    column          14 comments       Pile of Shame - Natsuki Crisis   2014 Feb  5, 01:00 14 comments                 anime    A fun two-part girls-fighting-in-high-school OAV that doesn't take itself too seriously... until it does. ―  Natsuki Crisis When we first meet Kitsumi Natsuki, she's in her school dojo, gleefully trying to find a sparring partner. The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody. Luckily by this time, humanity had a pretty decent settlement going on the moon, and once thin...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - After School Tinker Bell   2014 Jan  8, 01:00 23 comments                 anime    This week, an OAV based on a light novel series about a romantic couple that solves mysteries around their school. ―  After School Tinker Bell In the last few years there have been a ton of anime adapted from light novels: those small, pulpy, simply written and easy-to-read populist books that lie somewhere between young adult novels and manga. But light novels have been around for a very long time, ...                    column          12 comments       Pile of Shame - Handsome Girl   2013 Dec 25, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    Justin revisits an old one-shot OAV by the creator of Marmalade Boy... and is a little underwhelmed. ―  Handsome Girl When I was in high school, I loved the show Marmalade Boy. A lot. In fact, I wrote an article about it! A perfectly addictive confectionary of chaste teenaged yearning and romance, and undiluted raw crippling angst, I lost many an evening to the adventures of the lovelorn protagonists...                    column          11 comments       Pile of Shame - The Sensualist   2013 Dec 11, 02:10 11 comments                 anime    This week, a unique erotic historical fiction film that has completely slipped through the cracks. ―  The Sensualist (A.K.A. The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty. It felt like a piece of another person's life, so fo...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - Emblem Take 2   2013 Nov 27, 02:02 16 comments                 anime    This week, a rare yakuza time travel comedy. Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic.

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA.

That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land.

Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair.

Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now.

Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A.

There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English.

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows.

The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair.

Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A.

There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English.

His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we.

The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody. Luckily by this time, humanity had a pretty decent settlement going on the moon, and once thin...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - After School Tinker Bell   2014 Jan  8, 01:00 23 comments                 anime    This week, an OAV based on a light novel series about a romantic couple that solves mysteries around their school. ―  After School Tinker Bell In the last few years there have been a ton of anime adapted from light novels: those small, pulpy, simply written and easy-to-read populist books that lie somewhere between young adult novels and manga.

A lot. In fact, I wrote an article about it! A perfectly addictive confectionary of chaste teenaged yearning and romance, and undiluted raw crippling angst, I lost many an evening to the adventures of the lovelorn protagonists...                    column          11 comments       Pile of Shame - The Sensualist   2013 Dec 11, 02:10 11 comments                 anime    This week, a unique erotic historical fiction film that has completely slipped through the cracks. ―  The Sensualist (A.K.A. The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty. It felt like a piece of another person's life, so fo...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - Emblem Take 2   2013 Nov 27, 02:02 16 comments                 anime    This week, a rare yakuza time travel comedy. Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing. Unless you go looking for trouble in Tokyo, it's unlikely that a...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame: Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories   2013 Nov 13, 01:13 17 comments                 anime    Trying to watch this OAV like biting into a large wad of wet cotton: it's not offensive or unpleasant, but you want to end the experience as fast as humanly possible. ―  Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories If there's anything that anime lacks, it's real, adult love stories. We have enough yearning, angsty teen romance to sink a battleship, but realistic love stories about people whose frontal lobes are fir...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Wanna-Be's   2013 Oct 30, 00:01 23 comments     Did anyone say ""I want more women's wrestling anime?"" .... No? Didn't think so. ―  Wanna-Be's Lately there's been a lot of chatter about the girls' wrestling TV series, Wanna Be The Strongest In The World. Given that virtually none of the chatter is positive, I'm not really making plans to check out the show for myself. But hearing about a mediocre girls' wresting anime did jog my memory about anothe...                    column          5 comments       Pile of Shame - Grandeek: The Alternative   2013 Sep 18, 00:56 5 comments                 anime    An early digipaint OAV that has a lot of potential, but is so awkwardly made that the storytelling really suffers. ―  Grandeek: The Alternative When visiting Japan, one of my favorite things to do is explore the DVD sections of every Book Off location I can find.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

I mean that honestly.

Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up?   by Matthew Roe, Apr 23rd 2022          Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up?   by Matthew Roe, Apr 23rd 2022          Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up?   by Matthew Roe, Apr 23rd 2022          Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up?   by Matthew Roe, Apr 23rd 2022          Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up?   by Matthew Roe, Apr 23rd 2022          Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.

Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up?   by Matthew Roe, Apr 23rd 2022          Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed.

I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

27-04-2022,anime,8,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/watch/2022-04-22/paranoia-agent-how-does-it-hold-up/.184902,Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up? - Anime News Network:SEA,"       Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up?   by Matthew Roe, Apr 23rd 2022          Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.

All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

27-04-2022,anime,8,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/watch/2022-04-22/paranoia-agent-how-does-it-hold-up/.184902,Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up? - Anime News Network:SEA,"        Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator.

While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.

Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him.

Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that.

It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it.

Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

27-04-2022,anime,8,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/watch/2022-04-22/paranoia-agent-how-does-it-hold-up/.184902,Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up? - Anime News Network:SEA,"   Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.

While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill.

While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog.

Square Enix announced a lavish 1/6 scale figure of Terra from Final Fantasy VI on Sunday. As beautifully crafted as this statue of Terra in her Magitek is, the bigger subject of conversation has been its hefty price tag: 1,485,000 yen, or approximately US$11,570.     SQEX MASTERLINE FFVIは販売価格1,485,000円（税込）、2023年7月28日発売予定、全世界600個限定生産（そのうち日本は150個）です。※各国の割り振りは受注状況によって変更の可能性がございます※生産数に達し次第予約終了とさせていただきます#SQEXMASTERLINE #FF6 pic.twitter.com/OCGI5WeKwo— SQUARE ENIX Official Goods (@SQEX_MD_GOODS) April 24, 2022     Not only have die-hard fans been commenting on the steep price, even Final Fantasy director Hironobu Sakaguchi tweeted: ""Whoa, that's a bit much.""    Production will be limited to 600 units, with 150 of them in Japan. Orders opened on Square Enix's Japan store on Monday, and will run until June 24 (or until stock runs out).    A video interview with Yoshitaka Amano, who designed the original logo that the statue is based on, is available with English subtitles.    The original Final Fantasy VI game launched for Super Famicom in Japan in 1994. The game has since had releases on PlayStation, Game Boy Advance, smartphones, and PC. The Final Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster game launched for PC via Steam and mobile devices on February 23 in North America.        discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

The new cast members include:    Ikumi Hasegawa as Akatsuki Minami, Yume and Mizuto's cheerful classmate   Nobuhiko Okamoto as Kogure Kawanami, Yume and Mizuto's worldly-wise classmate    Miyu Tomita as Isana Higashira, a girl who interacts with Mizuto based on their common light novel interests     The new staff members include sound director Yayoi Tateishi, sound producer Bit Groove Production, music composer Hiromi Mizutani (Non Non Biyori, Hell Girl), and music producers Pony Canyon and APDREAM.     The cast includes Rina Hidaka as Yume Irido and Hiro Shimono as Mizuto Irido.    Shinsuke Yanagi (Bottom-tier Character Tomozaki) is directing the anime at project No.9. Deko Akao (Komi Can't Communicate) is overseeing and writing the series scripts. Katsuyuki Sato (Fire in His Fingertips -My Childhood Friend is a Fireman-) is designing the characters.    J-Novel Club licensed the light novel series, and it describes the story:   Ah, high school. Is there any better place to start fresh after a horrible middle school relationship? Nope! Not unless your ex ends up at the same school as you and is now your stepsibling. What was supposed to be a sanctuary of peace where I could avoid ever seeing her again has become a living nightmare! Everywhere I look, I see her—in my house, in my school, in my class. There's no escape! She even claims that she's the older sibling. Like hell she is!   But I won't lose to her. After all, I'm the older brother in this new family situation. That's right, we're family now. No matter how much we may have thought we loved each other before, we saw one another's true colors and realized we weren't meant for each other. That's why even though we may keep up a buddy-buddy sibling act for the sake of our parents, things will never go back to the way they used to be.    Kamishiro began serializing the story in the Kakuyomu website in August 2017, and uploaded the latest chapter on August 24. Kadokawa began publishing the story in print volumes with illustrations by Takayaki (Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest), beginning with the first volume in December 2018. Kadokawa published the eighth volume on February 1.    Rei Kusakabe launched a manga adaptation of the novels in Kadokawa's ComicWalker website in December 2019.

The video reveals and previews the anime's opening theme song ""Deneb to Spica"" (Deneb and Spica) by DIALOGUE+, reveals more cast and staff members for the anime, and also reveals the anime's July premiere date on AT-X, Tokyo MX, BS NTV, and BS Fuji.        The new cast members include:    Ikumi Hasegawa as Akatsuki Minami, Yume and Mizuto's cheerful classmate   Nobuhiko Okamoto as Kogure Kawanami, Yume and Mizuto's worldly-wise classmate    Miyu Tomita as Isana Higashira, a girl who interacts with Mizuto based on their common light novel interests     The new staff members include sound director Yayoi Tateishi, sound producer Bit Groove Production, music composer Hiromi Mizutani (Non Non Biyori, Hell Girl), and music producers Pony Canyon and APDREAM.     The cast includes Rina Hidaka as Yume Irido and Hiro Shimono as Mizuto Irido.    Shinsuke Yanagi (Bottom-tier Character Tomozaki) is directing the anime at project No.9. Deko Akao (Komi Can't Communicate) is overseeing and writing the series scripts. Katsuyuki Sato (Fire in His Fingertips -My Childhood Friend is a Fireman-) is designing the characters.    J-Novel Club licensed the light novel series, and it describes the story:   Ah, high school. Is there any better place to start fresh after a horrible middle school relationship? Nope! Not unless your ex ends up at the same school as you and is now your stepsibling. What was supposed to be a sanctuary of peace where I could avoid ever seeing her again has become a living nightmare! Everywhere I look, I see her—in my house, in my school, in my class. There's no escape! She even claims that she's the older sibling. Like hell she is!   But I won't lose to her. After all, I'm the older brother in this new family situation. That's right, we're family now. No matter how much we may have thought we loved each other before, we saw one another's true colors and realized we weren't meant for each other. That's why even though we may keep up a buddy-buddy sibling act for the sake of our parents, things will never go back to the way they used to be.    Kamishiro began serializing the story in the Kakuyomu website in August 2017, and uploaded the latest chapter on August 24. Kadokawa began publishing the story in print volumes with illustrations by Takayaki (Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest), beginning with the first volume in December 2018. Kadokawa published the eighth volume on February 1.    Rei Kusakabe launched a manga adaptation of the novels in Kadokawa's ComicWalker website in December 2019. Kadokawa published the manga's third volume in May 2021.

News Toei Animation Establishes Animator Training Program   posted on 2022-04-26 01:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Program starts in April 2023    Toei Animation announced on Wednesday that it is establishing ""Toei Animation Sakuga Academy,"" an animator training program, in April 2023. It is a one-year, short-term intensive, and practical animator training program in which experienced animators guide up-and-coming trainees. Following the training and an examination, successful students will be hired as contract workers for Toei Animation. Recruitment is open.    Atsutoshi Umezawa (One Piece, Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F', Sailor Moon Crystal, Digimon Tamers) is the program director. Lecturers are from Toei Animation and Studio Live, and they include Takeo Ide (Dragon Ball Z, One Piece, Dragon Ball Super), Hiroshi Koujina (Hunter × Hunter 2011, City Hunter '91), Nishiki Itaoka (Smile Precure!), Mai Ishii (Ushio & Tora, Hunter × Hunter 2011), and Mayuko Nakano (WWW.WAGNARIA!!, The Vampire Dies in No Time).    The program consists of three months of video training, followed by a nine-month animation or digital video course, depending on the aspirations of each student. The program will accept about 10 participants. Toei Animation will handle the tuition costs and will also offer 150,000 yen (about US$1.170) per month to students.
