Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

It's good to remember that any show is first and foremost supposed to be entertaining and very few people are entertain by being told/lectured about something they oppose. They'd much rather hear they're previous view be confirmed, ie that landlord and company are evil and the cause of all their problems.

You're making up an argument of how you think the show's messaging is framed while admitting you have no comment on the show because you haven't watched it. The entire basis of your statement could be entirely imaginary without knowing how the show actually presents its themes.     Quote:    Gentrification is due to not building enough housing.            Gentrification is taking neighborhoods that were culturally and demographically not white, pushing the residents of those neighborhoods out via rent and price increases, and then wallpapering over all the unique businesses that existed there. Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.   Also the way you're approaching the writer by attempting to negate their experience and indirectly  call them stupid is rude and unwarranted.

But gentrification happens in a whooole lot of places, including countries/regions that are racially and ethnically a lot more homogenous (or at least far less diverse) than the US, where it manifests in different ways although the end result is the same: people with less income are pushed out by people with more income. Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.     ANN_Lynzee wrote:    Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.           Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

I think the creators would have to understand what it's like to live in SF over many years and bear witness to the changes that have happened over the past few decades. If they consulted with researchers or knew long-time residents, maybe it would have been more accurate.

And of course, obviously cities have to change over time because older people are going to be replaced by younger people, who have different interests - when that doesn't happen it just empties out as in Sakura Quest.

Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.            The post you're responding to unfortunately is a much better explanation of SF's housing crisis than it sounds like Muteking is, but the new housing isn't about forcing people into low-income housing. Rather the problem is there isn't any housing of any kind, ever, because the city is basically determined to stop anyone from ever moving to it. So:   - there's no expensive housing, so richer people instead outbid poorer people for the existing older housing. (So building more expensive housing prevents gentrification through ""yuppie fishbowls"".)   - while all existing housing is rent-controlled, there's no new rent-controlled housing built either, so gentrification happens just because their own children can't afford to live there and have to leave.   - if you've lived there since the 70s, you're now a millionaire if you sell your house, so otherwise poor people might want to do that anyway.   - and there's also not enough schools or large enough houses for families, so they tend to move out once families get bigger and are replaced by single people/couples.   It's not because of ""tech"" though. The tech boom in SF is very recent and displacement happened before they got there. The explanation Muteking gives for this is pretty common in the area though; it's called ""left-NIMBYism"" and the people who believe it tend to be DSA members whose parents turn out to be landlords, socialists on the SF city council who own mansions, or leftist magazine owners known on Twitter for firing all their writers when they tried to unionize. (Not to name names on an anime forum…)   Some much better writing by a local Black affordable housing developer:   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-look-of-gentrification   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in-111   Personally I'd rather talk about ""displacement"" than ""gentrification"", since it's more specific and people seem to think you stop ""gentrification"" by not painting bike lanes.   As for whether gentrification is caused by things other than housing prices… unfortunately, if this is about SF, literally everything is about housing prices.

I figured it'd annoy everyone one way or the other, either from not being able to get past the cheesy superhero bits or the swings it took at serious subject matters despite adamantly sticking to being a cheesy superhero show (either because they're there or because they can only go so far). So, uhh, comments here seem to line up with that pretty well, for the most part...   I'm glad to see a largely (if not entirely) positive review in any case, because if you go into it with juuuust the right mindset, it's a real good time and has its heart in the right place.

I want to mention that I loved Crows, and even Insight was quite decent to me. But this one was just... bad. First off, the dancing is terrible, and for a show that has that as its theme, the dancing should be at least good. But my problem is that the antagonists are literally the same as the old Legion of Doom from the old Avengers cartoon: cartoonishly evil. I admit I don't really care about gentrification, but as this review said, there should be something else for me here. There isn't. The animation is pretty bad, the characters are one-dimensional.... and to be quite honest, it doesn't even seem to get the gentrification part right. From my understanding, the way it works is that a poor neighborhood is significantly improved, but in such a way that the cost of living there also increases, making it hard or even impossible for the people who were living there in the first place to continue doing so. So give this one a pass and check out Crowds and Insight if you want to see some tokusatsu tackle social issues. I would also recommend Yoru no Yatterman as well, but that one fumbled the second half so bad it's not worth talking about it.   tl:rd: Not a good show. Misses it's own point and doesn't even look good while doing it.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

It's good to remember that any show is first and foremost supposed to be entertaining and very few people are entertain by being told/lectured about something they oppose.

You're making up an argument of how you think the show's messaging is framed while admitting you have no comment on the show because you haven't watched it. The entire basis of your statement could be entirely imaginary without knowing how the show actually presents its themes.     Quote:    Gentrification is due to not building enough housing.            Gentrification is taking neighborhoods that were culturally and demographically not white, pushing the residents of those neighborhoods out via rent and price increases, and then wallpapering over all the unique businesses that existed there. Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.   Also the way you're approaching the writer by attempting to negate their experience and indirectly  call them stupid is rude and unwarranted.

But gentrification happens in a whooole lot of places, including countries/regions that are racially and ethnically a lot more homogenous (or at least far less diverse) than the US, where it manifests in different ways although the end result is the same: people with less income are pushed out by people with more income. Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.     ANN_Lynzee wrote:    Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.           Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

Feels more like generic secondhand Americana. It's certainly no Macross Frontier.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

SHD wrote:    ...Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.           Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco. Feels more like generic secondhand Americana...           I think the creators would have to understand what it's like to live in SF over many years and bear witness to the changes that have happened over the past few decades. If they consulted with researchers or knew long-time residents, maybe it would have been more accurate.

And of course, obviously cities have to change over time because older people are going to be replaced by younger people, who have different interests - when that doesn't happen it just empties out as in Sakura Quest.

Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.            The post you're responding to unfortunately is a much better explanation of SF's housing crisis than it sounds like Muteking is, but the new housing isn't about forcing people into low-income housing. Rather the problem is there isn't any housing of any kind, ever, because the city is basically determined to stop anyone from ever moving to it. So:   - there's no expensive housing, so richer people instead outbid poorer people for the existing older housing. (So building more expensive housing prevents gentrification through ""yuppie fishbowls"".)   - while all existing housing is rent-controlled, there's no new rent-controlled housing built either, so gentrification happens just because their own children can't afford to live there and have to leave.   - if you've lived there since the 70s, you're now a millionaire if you sell your house, so otherwise poor people might want to do that anyway.   - and there's also not enough schools or large enough houses for families, so they tend to move out once families get bigger and are replaced by single people/couples.   It's not because of ""tech"" though. The tech boom in SF is very recent and displacement happened before they got there. The explanation Muteking gives for this is pretty common in the area though; it's called ""left-NIMBYism"" and the people who believe it tend to be DSA members whose parents turn out to be landlords, socialists on the SF city council who own mansions, or leftist magazine owners known on Twitter for firing all their writers when they tried to unionize. (Not to name names on an anime forum…)   Some much better writing by a local Black affordable housing developer:   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-look-of-gentrification   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in-111   Personally I'd rather talk about ""displacement"" than ""gentrification"", since it's more specific and people seem to think you stop ""gentrification"" by not painting bike lanes.   As for whether gentrification is caused by things other than housing prices… unfortunately, if this is about SF, literally everything is about housing prices.

I figured it'd annoy everyone one way or the other, either from not being able to get past the cheesy superhero bits or the swings it took at serious subject matters despite adamantly sticking to being a cheesy superhero show (either because they're there or because they can only go so far). So, uhh, comments here seem to line up with that pretty well, for the most part...   I'm glad to see a largely (if not entirely) positive review in any case, because if you go into it with juuuust the right mindset, it's a real good time and has its heart in the right place.

I want to mention that I loved Crows, and even Insight was quite decent to me. But this one was just... bad. First off, the dancing is terrible, and for a show that has that as its theme, the dancing should be at least good. But my problem is that the antagonists are literally the same as the old Legion of Doom from the old Avengers cartoon: cartoonishly evil. I admit I don't really care about gentrification, but as this review said, there should be something else for me here. There isn't. The animation is pretty bad, the characters are one-dimensional.... and to be quite honest, it doesn't even seem to get the gentrification part right. From my understanding, the way it works is that a poor neighborhood is significantly improved, but in such a way that the cost of living there also increases, making it hard or even impossible for the people who were living there in the first place to continue doing so. So give this one a pass and check out Crowds and Insight if you want to see some tokusatsu tackle social issues. I would also recommend Yoru no Yatterman as well, but that one fumbled the second half so bad it's not worth talking about it.   tl:rd: Not a good show. Misses it's own point and doesn't even look good while doing it.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

But gentrification happens in a whooole lot of places, including countries/regions that are racially and ethnically a lot more homogenous (or at least far less diverse) than the US, where it manifests in different ways although the end result is the same: people with less income are pushed out by people with more income. Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.

Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

I think the creators would have to understand what it's like to live in SF over many years and bear witness to the changes that have happened over the past few decades. If they consulted with researchers or knew long-time residents, maybe it would have been more accurate.

And of course, obviously cities have to change over time because older people are going to be replaced by younger people, who have different interests - when that doesn't happen it just empties out as in Sakura Quest.

Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.            The post you're responding to unfortunately is a much better explanation of SF's housing crisis than it sounds like Muteking is, but the new housing isn't about forcing people into low-income housing. Rather the problem is there isn't any housing of any kind, ever, because the city is basically determined to stop anyone from ever moving to it. So:   - there's no expensive housing, so richer people instead outbid poorer people for the existing older housing. (So building more expensive housing prevents gentrification through ""yuppie fishbowls"".)   - while all existing housing is rent-controlled, there's no new rent-controlled housing built either, so gentrification happens just because their own children can't afford to live there and have to leave.   - if you've lived there since the 70s, you're now a millionaire if you sell your house, so otherwise poor people might want to do that anyway.   - and there's also not enough schools or large enough houses for families, so they tend to move out once families get bigger and are replaced by single people/couples.   It's not because of ""tech"" though. The tech boom in SF is very recent and displacement happened before they got there. The explanation Muteking gives for this is pretty common in the area though; it's called ""left-NIMBYism"" and the people who believe it tend to be DSA members whose parents turn out to be landlords, socialists on the SF city council who own mansions, or leftist magazine owners known on Twitter for firing all their writers when they tried to unionize. (Not to name names on an anime forum…)   Some much better writing by a local Black affordable housing developer:   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-look-of-gentrification   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in-111   Personally I'd rather talk about ""displacement"" than ""gentrification"", since it's more specific and people seem to think you stop ""gentrification"" by not painting bike lanes.   As for whether gentrification is caused by things other than housing prices… unfortunately, if this is about SF, literally everything is about housing prices.

I figured it'd annoy everyone one way or the other, either from not being able to get past the cheesy superhero bits or the swings it took at serious subject matters despite adamantly sticking to being a cheesy superhero show (either because they're there or because they can only go so far). So, uhh, comments here seem to line up with that pretty well, for the most part...   I'm glad to see a largely (if not entirely) positive review in any case, because if you go into it with juuuust the right mindset, it's a real good time and has its heart in the right place.

I want to mention that I loved Crows, and even Insight was quite decent to me. But this one was just... bad. First off, the dancing is terrible, and for a show that has that as its theme, the dancing should be at least good. But my problem is that the antagonists are literally the same as the old Legion of Doom from the old Avengers cartoon: cartoonishly evil. I admit I don't really care about gentrification, but as this review said, there should be something else for me here. There isn't. The animation is pretty bad, the characters are one-dimensional.... and to be quite honest, it doesn't even seem to get the gentrification part right. From my understanding, the way it works is that a poor neighborhood is significantly improved, but in such a way that the cost of living there also increases, making it hard or even impossible for the people who were living there in the first place to continue doing so. So give this one a pass and check out Crowds and Insight if you want to see some tokusatsu tackle social issues. I would also recommend Yoru no Yatterman as well, but that one fumbled the second half so bad it's not worth talking about it.   tl:rd: Not a good show. Misses it's own point and doesn't even look good while doing it.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

And of course, obviously cities have to change over time because older people are going to be replaced by younger people, who have different interests - when that doesn't happen it just empties out as in Sakura Quest.

Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.            The post you're responding to unfortunately is a much better explanation of SF's housing crisis than it sounds like Muteking is, but the new housing isn't about forcing people into low-income housing. Rather the problem is there isn't any housing of any kind, ever, because the city is basically determined to stop anyone from ever moving to it. So:   - there's no expensive housing, so richer people instead outbid poorer people for the existing older housing. (So building more expensive housing prevents gentrification through ""yuppie fishbowls"".)   - while all existing housing is rent-controlled, there's no new rent-controlled housing built either, so gentrification happens just because their own children can't afford to live there and have to leave.   - if you've lived there since the 70s, you're now a millionaire if you sell your house, so otherwise poor people might want to do that anyway.   - and there's also not enough schools or large enough houses for families, so they tend to move out once families get bigger and are replaced by single people/couples.   It's not because of ""tech"" though. The tech boom in SF is very recent and displacement happened before they got there. The explanation Muteking gives for this is pretty common in the area though; it's called ""left-NIMBYism"" and the people who believe it tend to be DSA members whose parents turn out to be landlords, socialists on the SF city council who own mansions, or leftist magazine owners known on Twitter for firing all their writers when they tried to unionize. (Not to name names on an anime forum…)   Some much better writing by a local Black affordable housing developer:   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-look-of-gentrification   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in-111   Personally I'd rather talk about ""displacement"" than ""gentrification"", since it's more specific and people seem to think you stop ""gentrification"" by not painting bike lanes.   As for whether gentrification is caused by things other than housing prices… unfortunately, if this is about SF, literally everything is about housing prices.

I figured it'd annoy everyone one way or the other, either from not being able to get past the cheesy superhero bits or the swings it took at serious subject matters despite adamantly sticking to being a cheesy superhero show (either because they're there or because they can only go so far). So, uhh, comments here seem to line up with that pretty well, for the most part...   I'm glad to see a largely (if not entirely) positive review in any case, because if you go into it with juuuust the right mindset, it's a real good time and has its heart in the right place.

I want to mention that I loved Crows, and even Insight was quite decent to me. But this one was just... bad. First off, the dancing is terrible, and for a show that has that as its theme, the dancing should be at least good. But my problem is that the antagonists are literally the same as the old Legion of Doom from the old Avengers cartoon: cartoonishly evil. I admit I don't really care about gentrification, but as this review said, there should be something else for me here. There isn't. The animation is pretty bad, the characters are one-dimensional.... and to be quite honest, it doesn't even seem to get the gentrification part right. From my understanding, the way it works is that a poor neighborhood is significantly improved, but in such a way that the cost of living there also increases, making it hard or even impossible for the people who were living there in the first place to continue doing so. So give this one a pass and check out Crowds and Insight if you want to see some tokusatsu tackle social issues. I would also recommend Yoru no Yatterman as well, but that one fumbled the second half so bad it's not worth talking about it.   tl:rd: Not a good show. Misses it's own point and doesn't even look good while doing it.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

But gentrification happens in a whooole lot of places, including countries/regions that are racially and ethnically a lot more homogenous (or at least far less diverse) than the US, where it manifests in different ways although the end result is the same: people with less income are pushed out by people with more income. Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.

Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.            The post you're responding to unfortunately is a much better explanation of SF's housing crisis than it sounds like Muteking is, but the new housing isn't about forcing people into low-income housing. Rather the problem is there isn't any housing of any kind, ever, because the city is basically determined to stop anyone from ever moving to it. So:   - there's no expensive housing, so richer people instead outbid poorer people for the existing older housing. (So building more expensive housing prevents gentrification through ""yuppie fishbowls"".)   - while all existing housing is rent-controlled, there's no new rent-controlled housing built either, so gentrification happens just because their own children can't afford to live there and have to leave.   - if you've lived there since the 70s, you're now a millionaire if you sell your house, so otherwise poor people might want to do that anyway.   - and there's also not enough schools or large enough houses for families, so they tend to move out once families get bigger and are replaced by single people/couples.   It's not because of ""tech"" though. The tech boom in SF is very recent and displacement happened before they got there. The explanation Muteking gives for this is pretty common in the area though; it's called ""left-NIMBYism"" and the people who believe it tend to be DSA members whose parents turn out to be landlords, socialists on the SF city council who own mansions, or leftist magazine owners known on Twitter for firing all their writers when they tried to unionize.

As for whether gentrification is caused by things other than housing prices… unfortunately, if this is about SF, literally everything is about housing prices.

I want to mention that I loved Crows, and even Insight was quite decent to me. But this one was just... bad. First off, the dancing is terrible, and for a show that has that as its theme, the dancing should be at least good. But my problem is that the antagonists are literally the same as the old Legion of Doom from the old Avengers cartoon: cartoonishly evil. I admit I don't really care about gentrification, but as this review said, there should be something else for me here. There isn't. The animation is pretty bad, the characters are one-dimensional.... and to be quite honest, it doesn't even seem to get the gentrification part right. From my understanding, the way it works is that a poor neighborhood is significantly improved, but in such a way that the cost of living there also increases, making it hard or even impossible for the people who were living there in the first place to continue doing so. So give this one a pass and check out Crowds and Insight if you want to see some tokusatsu tackle social issues. I would also recommend Yoru no Yatterman as well, but that one fumbled the second half so bad it's not worth talking about it.   tl:rd: Not a good show. Misses it's own point and doesn't even look good while doing it.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

You're making up an argument of how you think the show's messaging is framed while admitting you have no comment on the show because you haven't watched it. The entire basis of your statement could be entirely imaginary without knowing how the show actually presents its themes.

Also the way you're approaching the writer by attempting to negate their experience and indirectly  call them stupid is rude and unwarranted.

But gentrification happens in a whooole lot of places, including countries/regions that are racially and ethnically a lot more homogenous (or at least far less diverse) than the US, where it manifests in different ways although the end result is the same: people with less income are pushed out by people with more income. Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.     ANN_Lynzee wrote:    Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.           Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.

Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.            The post you're responding to unfortunately is a much better explanation of SF's housing crisis than it sounds like Muteking is, but the new housing isn't about forcing people into low-income housing. Rather the problem is there isn't any housing of any kind, ever, because the city is basically determined to stop anyone from ever moving to it. So:   - there's no expensive housing, so richer people instead outbid poorer people for the existing older housing. (So building more expensive housing prevents gentrification through ""yuppie fishbowls"".)   - while all existing housing is rent-controlled, there's no new rent-controlled housing built either, so gentrification happens just because their own children can't afford to live there and have to leave.   - if you've lived there since the 70s, you're now a millionaire if you sell your house, so otherwise poor people might want to do that anyway.   - and there's also not enough schools or large enough houses for families, so they tend to move out once families get bigger and are replaced by single people/couples.   It's not because of ""tech"" though. The tech boom in SF is very recent and displacement happened before they got there. The explanation Muteking gives for this is pretty common in the area though; it's called ""left-NIMBYism"" and the people who believe it tend to be DSA members whose parents turn out to be landlords, socialists on the SF city council who own mansions, or leftist magazine owners known on Twitter for firing all their writers when they tried to unionize. (Not to name names on an anime forum…)   Some much better writing by a local Black affordable housing developer:   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-look-of-gentrification   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in-111   Personally I'd rather talk about ""displacement"" than ""gentrification"", since it's more specific and people seem to think you stop ""gentrification"" by not painting bike lanes.   As for whether gentrification is caused by things other than housing prices… unfortunately, if this is about SF, literally everything is about housing prices.

I figured it'd annoy everyone one way or the other, either from not being able to get past the cheesy superhero bits or the swings it took at serious subject matters despite adamantly sticking to being a cheesy superhero show (either because they're there or because they can only go so far). So, uhh, comments here seem to line up with that pretty well, for the most part...   I'm glad to see a largely (if not entirely) positive review in any case, because if you go into it with juuuust the right mindset, it's a real good time and has its heart in the right place.

I want to mention that I loved Crows, and even Insight was quite decent to me. But this one was just... bad. First off, the dancing is terrible, and for a show that has that as its theme, the dancing should be at least good. But my problem is that the antagonists are literally the same as the old Legion of Doom from the old Avengers cartoon: cartoonishly evil. I admit I don't really care about gentrification, but as this review said, there should be something else for me here. There isn't. The animation is pretty bad, the characters are one-dimensional.... and to be quite honest, it doesn't even seem to get the gentrification part right. From my understanding, the way it works is that a poor neighborhood is significantly improved, but in such a way that the cost of living there also increases, making it hard or even impossible for the people who were living there in the first place to continue doing so. So give this one a pass and check out Crowds and Insight if you want to see some tokusatsu tackle social issues. I would also recommend Yoru no Yatterman as well, but that one fumbled the second half so bad it's not worth talking about it.   tl:rd: Not a good show. Misses it's own point and doesn't even look good while doing it.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

(Not to name names on an anime forum…)   Some much better writing by a local Black affordable housing developer:   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-look-of-gentrification   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in-111   Personally I'd rather talk about ""displacement"" than ""gentrification"", since it's more specific and people seem to think you stop ""gentrification"" by not painting bike lanes.   As for whether gentrification is caused by things other than housing prices… unfortunately, if this is about SF, literally everything is about housing prices.

I figured it'd annoy everyone one way or the other, either from not being able to get past the cheesy superhero bits or the swings it took at serious subject matters despite adamantly sticking to being a cheesy superhero show (either because they're there or because they can only go so far). So, uhh, comments here seem to line up with that pretty well, for the most part...   I'm glad to see a largely (if not entirely) positive review in any case, because if you go into it with juuuust the right mindset, it's a real good time and has its heart in the right place.

I want to mention that I loved Crows, and even Insight was quite decent to me. But this one was just... bad. First off, the dancing is terrible, and for a show that has that as its theme, the dancing should be at least good. But my problem is that the antagonists are literally the same as the old Legion of Doom from the old Avengers cartoon: cartoonishly evil. I admit I don't really care about gentrification, but as this review said, there should be something else for me here. There isn't. The animation is pretty bad, the characters are one-dimensional.... and to be quite honest, it doesn't even seem to get the gentrification part right. From my understanding, the way it works is that a poor neighborhood is significantly improved, but in such a way that the cost of living there also increases, making it hard or even impossible for the people who were living there in the first place to continue doing so. So give this one a pass and check out Crowds and Insight if you want to see some tokusatsu tackle social issues. I would also recommend Yoru no Yatterman as well, but that one fumbled the second half so bad it's not worth talking about it.   tl:rd: Not a good show. Misses it's own point and doesn't even look good while doing it.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

But gentrification happens in a whooole lot of places, including countries/regions that are racially and ethnically a lot more homogenous (or at least far less diverse) than the US, where it manifests in different ways although the end result is the same: people with less income are pushed out by people with more income. Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.

Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

I think the creators would have to understand what it's like to live in SF over many years and bear witness to the changes that have happened over the past few decades. If they consulted with researchers or knew long-time residents, maybe it would have been more accurate.

And of course, obviously cities have to change over time because older people are going to be replaced by younger people, who have different interests - when that doesn't happen it just empties out as in Sakura Quest.

Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.            The post you're responding to unfortunately is a much better explanation of SF's housing crisis than it sounds like Muteking is, but the new housing isn't about forcing people into low-income housing. Rather the problem is there isn't any housing of any kind, ever, because the city is basically determined to stop anyone from ever moving to it. So:   - there's no expensive housing, so richer people instead outbid poorer people for the existing older housing. (So building more expensive housing prevents gentrification through ""yuppie fishbowls"".)   - while all existing housing is rent-controlled, there's no new rent-controlled housing built either, so gentrification happens just because their own children can't afford to live there and have to leave.   - if you've lived there since the 70s, you're now a millionaire if you sell your house, so otherwise poor people might want to do that anyway.   - and there's also not enough schools or large enough houses for families, so they tend to move out once families get bigger and are replaced by single people/couples.   It's not because of ""tech"" though. The tech boom in SF is very recent and displacement happened before they got there. The explanation Muteking gives for this is pretty common in the area though; it's called ""left-NIMBYism"" and the people who believe it tend to be DSA members whose parents turn out to be landlords, socialists on the SF city council who own mansions, or leftist magazine owners known on Twitter for firing all their writers when they tried to unionize.

They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

I think the creators would have to understand what it's like to live in SF over many years and bear witness to the changes that have happened over the past few decades. If they consulted with researchers or knew long-time residents, maybe it would have been more accurate.

Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.            The post you're responding to unfortunately is a much better explanation of SF's housing crisis than it sounds like Muteking is, but the new housing isn't about forcing people into low-income housing. Rather the problem is there isn't any housing of any kind, ever, because the city is basically determined to stop anyone from ever moving to it. So:   - there's no expensive housing, so richer people instead outbid poorer people for the existing older housing. (So building more expensive housing prevents gentrification through ""yuppie fishbowls"".)   - while all existing housing is rent-controlled, there's no new rent-controlled housing built either, so gentrification happens just because their own children can't afford to live there and have to leave.   - if you've lived there since the 70s, you're now a millionaire if you sell your house, so otherwise poor people might want to do that anyway.   - and there's also not enough schools or large enough houses for families, so they tend to move out once families get bigger and are replaced by single people/couples.   It's not because of ""tech"" though. The tech boom in SF is very recent and displacement happened before they got there. The explanation Muteking gives for this is pretty common in the area though; it's called ""left-NIMBYism"" and the people who believe it tend to be DSA members whose parents turn out to be landlords, socialists on the SF city council who own mansions, or leftist magazine owners known on Twitter for firing all their writers when they tried to unionize.

I figured it'd annoy everyone one way or the other, either from not being able to get past the cheesy superhero bits or the swings it took at serious subject matters despite adamantly sticking to being a cheesy superhero show (either because they're there or because they can only go so far). So, uhh, comments here seem to line up with that pretty well, for the most part...   I'm glad to see a largely (if not entirely) positive review in any case, because if you go into it with juuuust the right mindset, it's a real good time and has its heart in the right place.

I want to mention that I loved Crows, and even Insight was quite decent to me. But this one was just... bad. First off, the dancing is terrible, and for a show that has that as its theme, the dancing should be at least good. But my problem is that the antagonists are literally the same as the old Legion of Doom from the old Avengers cartoon: cartoonishly evil. I admit I don't really care about gentrification, but as this review said, there should be something else for me here. There isn't. The animation is pretty bad, the characters are one-dimensional.... and to be quite honest, it doesn't even seem to get the gentrification part right. From my understanding, the way it works is that a poor neighborhood is significantly improved, but in such a way that the cost of living there also increases, making it hard or even impossible for the people who were living there in the first place to continue doing so. So give this one a pass and check out Crowds and Insight if you want to see some tokusatsu tackle social issues. I would also recommend Yoru no Yatterman as well, but that one fumbled the second half so bad it's not worth talking about it.   tl:rd: Not a good show. Misses it's own point and doesn't even look good while doing it.

GN 1                     Synopsis:             Oogami has just been transferred to the planning department of the bedding company he works for. Since he was never all that keen on sales where he was before, this doesn't really bother him, even if he's the only carnivore working there. But he's also got a raging crush on Mitsuji, his new boss – and since she's an herbivore, that means that he has to really work at controlling himself. Is his love doomed before it even gets started?      Review:         Synopsis:        Oogami has just been transferred to the planning department of the bedding company he works for. Since he was never all that keen on sales where he was before, this doesn't really bother him, even if he's the only carnivore working there. But he's also got a raging crush on Mitsuji, his new boss – and since she's an herbivore, that means that he has to really work at controlling himself. Is his love doomed before it even gets started?     Review:            It's not entirely fair to say that this is essentially BEASTARS Lite, but it's also a little hard to shake that feeling. Shino Shimizu's I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep! takes a just-similar-enough premise to tell its workplace romantic comedy: in its world, people have animal characteristics and are divided between herbivore and carnivore. They're not full-on animals, but rather people somehow descended or evolved from animals, with everyone having ears, tails (if applicable), and general tendencies inherited from their ancestors. There's a definite sense that the whole carnivore/herbivore classification isn't just about ancestry, however; it's also part of Japanese slang for how aggressive (or perhaps just interested) someone is in romantic or sexual encounters. Therefore Oogami, our hero, is going to have more trouble holding himself back from pursuing Mitsuji, our heroine, because he is a wolf and she's a sheep.    Part of this feeling stems from the fact that Shimizu's deliberately blurring the lines when it comes to carnivores talking about things like “biting” herbivores. Based on the context, it could be either a literal bite or a form of sexual behavior, and that mostly comes from some of Oogami's new coworkers and his job change. Before the story starts, Oogami was a salesman in the same company, and pretty much the entire sales team is composed of carnivores – a black leopard, a lion, a cat, another wolf, et cetera. Oogami remarks that he was basically herded into sales because of his wolf heritage, with the implication that that really wasn't where his interest lay at all. Meanwhile the product development team is, prior to Oogami's arrival, entirely made up of herbivores, and mostly sheep at that. Alice, one of the women in the department, notes that other carnivores have been brought into the department only to be run right out when they couldn't control themselves around all of the sheep – something that Alice and two of her friends are very interested in replicating so that they can get rid of Oogami. They make attempts to railroad him into “biting” them, but none of them work because he's so invested in Mitsuji, which, somewhat ironically, is a large part of why Alice and the others want him gone. As sheep, they're very protective of their leader, Mitsuji, and that makes Oogami a threat to her safety in their eyes.    Part of the light humor of the book comes from the fact that despite their protestations of “I'm like this because I'm a wolf/sheep/cat/whatever,” most of the characters are acting against type. Oogami might want Mitsuji desperately, but he's also able to behave like a decent person around her because he doesn't want to ruin his chance with her. Mitsuji may find herself shaking in meetings with carnivores or inclined to take up as little space as possible, but she's also incredibly capable and actually pretty comfortable around just about everyone, regardless of species. Alice is certainly no wilting wallflower and is more proactive than Hyoukawa the black leopard when it comes to getting what she wants. The animal natures feel more like societal assumptions than anything more primordial, stand-ins for gender and social class markers dressed up with ears and tails in order to lightly poke at them.    And it is a light form of social parody, so much so that you could easily ignore that entire aspect in favor of simply focusing on the romantic comedy elements. Things like the way Oogami's tail wags enthusiastically without his awareness when he's talking to Mitsuji or Alice tracking down Mitsuji's whereabouts from a piece of tail fluff work with the animal factors nicely while still keeping things lighthearted and a little goofy, and plenty of the staples of office romance are in place, such as getting locked in the reference room (workplace manga's equivalent of the gym storage room), going out drinking with colleagues, and interdepartmental competition. Oogami's crush on Mitsuji is more or less an open secret (even Mitsuji has at least an idea that he likes her) and serves to not only drive the plot, but to allow the characters to air all of their ingrained assumptions about themselves and others in the same way that someone's work record determines their worth in non-animal-based office rom coms. The animal bits and pieces pop up in odd moments to remind us they're there, such as Mitsuji's latest project being a pillow for people with horns.    Interestingly enough, there really isn't much made of the fact that some of the sheep have horns and others don't, which, if you're as inclined to overthinking as I am, could have easily been used as a marker of breed; instead, it is treated here like curly versus straight hair – some people have one and some people have the other. Of course, there isn't a ton of artistic consistency across the book as horned sheep are sometimes drawn without their horns, so it may be less intentional than it at first appears. It's very nice to look at otherwise, and I definitely appreciate that Shimizu explains why characters have both animal ears and human ears; basically the animal ears are nonfunctional in terms of hearing, but are an evolutionary leftover that can serve as emotional expressions.    All in all, I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep! is a fun little story. It isn't reinventing the office rom com wheel, but it also doesn't need to – it's just a variation on the theme with cute animal elements, which includes a bit of wordplay with the characters' names and their respective animal ancestors. Largely devoid of mean humor and mostly fluffy, it's a nice light read when you just want a book to relax with.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B-  + Cute story and budding relationship, good use of tails to show emotions. − Art can be inconsistent, a bit thin on plot.            discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Shino Shimizu   Full encyclopedia details aboutI'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

Therefore Oogami, our hero, is going to have more trouble holding himself back from pursuing Mitsuji, our heroine, because he is a wolf and she's a sheep.    Part of this feeling stems from the fact that Shimizu's deliberately blurring the lines when it comes to carnivores talking about things like “biting” herbivores. Based on the context, it could be either a literal bite or a form of sexual behavior, and that mostly comes from some of Oogami's new coworkers and his job change. Before the story starts, Oogami was a salesman in the same company, and pretty much the entire sales team is composed of carnivores – a black leopard, a lion, a cat, another wolf, et cetera. Oogami remarks that he was basically herded into sales because of his wolf heritage, with the implication that that really wasn't where his interest lay at all. Meanwhile the product development team is, prior to Oogami's arrival, entirely made up of herbivores, and mostly sheep at that. Alice, one of the women in the department, notes that other carnivores have been brought into the department only to be run right out when they couldn't control themselves around all of the sheep – something that Alice and two of her friends are very interested in replicating so that they can get rid of Oogami. They make attempts to railroad him into “biting” them, but none of them work because he's so invested in Mitsuji, which, somewhat ironically, is a large part of why Alice and the others want him gone.

Oogami might want Mitsuji desperately, but he's also able to behave like a decent person around her because he doesn't want to ruin his chance with her.

GN 1                     Synopsis:             Oogami has just been transferred to the planning department of the bedding company he works for. Since he was never all that keen on sales where he was before, this doesn't really bother him, even if he's the only carnivore working there. But he's also got a raging crush on Mitsuji, his new boss – and since she's an herbivore, that means that he has to really work at controlling himself. Is his love doomed before it even gets started?      Review:         Synopsis:        Oogami has just been transferred to the planning department of the bedding company he works for. Since he was never all that keen on sales where he was before, this doesn't really bother him, even if he's the only carnivore working there. But he's also got a raging crush on Mitsuji, his new boss – and since she's an herbivore, that means that he has to really work at controlling himself. Is his love doomed before it even gets started?     Review:            It's not entirely fair to say that this is essentially BEASTARS Lite, but it's also a little hard to shake that feeling. Shino Shimizu's I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep! takes a just-similar-enough premise to tell its workplace romantic comedy: in its world, people have animal characteristics and are divided between herbivore and carnivore. They're not full-on animals, but rather people somehow descended or evolved from animals, with everyone having ears, tails (if applicable), and general tendencies inherited from their ancestors. There's a definite sense that the whole carnivore/herbivore classification isn't just about ancestry, however; it's also part of Japanese slang for how aggressive (or perhaps just interested) someone is in romantic or sexual encounters. Therefore Oogami, our hero, is going to have more trouble holding himself back from pursuing Mitsuji, our heroine, because he is a wolf and she's a sheep.    Part of this feeling stems from the fact that Shimizu's deliberately blurring the lines when it comes to carnivores talking about things like “biting” herbivores. Based on the context, it could be either a literal bite or a form of sexual behavior, and that mostly comes from some of Oogami's new coworkers and his job change. Before the story starts, Oogami was a salesman in the same company, and pretty much the entire sales team is composed of carnivores – a black leopard, a lion, a cat, another wolf, et cetera. Oogami remarks that he was basically herded into sales because of his wolf heritage, with the implication that that really wasn't where his interest lay at all. Meanwhile the product development team is, prior to Oogami's arrival, entirely made up of herbivores, and mostly sheep at that. Alice, one of the women in the department, notes that other carnivores have been brought into the department only to be run right out when they couldn't control themselves around all of the sheep – something that Alice and two of her friends are very interested in replicating so that they can get rid of Oogami. They make attempts to railroad him into “biting” them, but none of them work because he's so invested in Mitsuji, which, somewhat ironically, is a large part of why Alice and the others want him gone. As sheep, they're very protective of their leader, Mitsuji, and that makes Oogami a threat to her safety in their eyes.    Part of the light humor of the book comes from the fact that despite their protestations of “I'm like this because I'm a wolf/sheep/cat/whatever,” most of the characters are acting against type. Oogami might want Mitsuji desperately, but he's also able to behave like a decent person around her because he doesn't want to ruin his chance with her. Mitsuji may find herself shaking in meetings with carnivores or inclined to take up as little space as possible, but she's also incredibly capable and actually pretty comfortable around just about everyone, regardless of species. Alice is certainly no wilting wallflower and is more proactive than Hyoukawa the black leopard when it comes to getting what she wants. The animal natures feel more like societal assumptions than anything more primordial, stand-ins for gender and social class markers dressed up with ears and tails in order to lightly poke at them.    And it is a light form of social parody, so much so that you could easily ignore that entire aspect in favor of simply focusing on the romantic comedy elements. Things like the way Oogami's tail wags enthusiastically without his awareness when he's talking to Mitsuji or Alice tracking down Mitsuji's whereabouts from a piece of tail fluff work with the animal factors nicely while still keeping things lighthearted and a little goofy, and plenty of the staples of office romance are in place, such as getting locked in the reference room (workplace manga's equivalent of the gym storage room), going out drinking with colleagues, and interdepartmental competition. Oogami's crush on Mitsuji is more or less an open secret (even Mitsuji has at least an idea that he likes her) and serves to not only drive the plot, but to allow the characters to air all of their ingrained assumptions about themselves and others in the same way that someone's work record determines their worth in non-animal-based office rom coms. The animal bits and pieces pop up in odd moments to remind us they're there, such as Mitsuji's latest project being a pillow for people with horns.    Interestingly enough, there really isn't much made of the fact that some of the sheep have horns and others don't, which, if you're as inclined to overthinking as I am, could have easily been used as a marker of breed; instead, it is treated here like curly versus straight hair – some people have one and some people have the other. Of course, there isn't a ton of artistic consistency across the book as horned sheep are sometimes drawn without their horns, so it may be less intentional than it at first appears. It's very nice to look at otherwise, and I definitely appreciate that Shimizu explains why characters have both animal ears and human ears; basically the animal ears are nonfunctional in terms of hearing, but are an evolutionary leftover that can serve as emotional expressions.    All in all, I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep! is a fun little story. It isn't reinventing the office rom com wheel, but it also doesn't need to – it's just a variation on the theme with cute animal elements, which includes a bit of wordplay with the characters' names and their respective animal ancestors. Largely devoid of mean humor and mostly fluffy, it's a nice light read when you just want a book to relax with.

GN 1                     Synopsis:             Oogami has just been transferred to the planning department of the bedding company he works for. Since he was never all that keen on sales where he was before, this doesn't really bother him, even if he's the only carnivore working there.

Is his love doomed before it even gets started?      Review:         Synopsis:        Oogami has just been transferred to the planning department of the bedding company he works for. Since he was never all that keen on sales where he was before, this doesn't really bother him, even if he's the only carnivore working there. But he's also got a raging crush on Mitsuji, his new boss – and since she's an herbivore, that means that he has to really work at controlling himself. Is his love doomed before it even gets started?     Review:            It's not entirely fair to say that this is essentially BEASTARS Lite, but it's also a little hard to shake that feeling. Shino Shimizu's I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep! takes a just-similar-enough premise to tell its workplace romantic comedy: in its world, people have animal characteristics and are divided between herbivore and carnivore. They're not full-on animals, but rather people somehow descended or evolved from animals, with everyone having ears, tails (if applicable), and general tendencies inherited from their ancestors. There's a definite sense that the whole carnivore/herbivore classification isn't just about ancestry, however; it's also part of Japanese slang for how aggressive (or perhaps just interested) someone is in romantic or sexual encounters. Therefore Oogami, our hero, is going to have more trouble holding himself back from pursuing Mitsuji, our heroine, because he is a wolf and she's a sheep.    Part of this feeling stems from the fact that Shimizu's deliberately blurring the lines when it comes to carnivores talking about things like “biting” herbivores. Based on the context, it could be either a literal bite or a form of sexual behavior, and that mostly comes from some of Oogami's new coworkers and his job change. Before the story starts, Oogami was a salesman in the same company, and pretty much the entire sales team is composed of carnivores – a black leopard, a lion, a cat, another wolf, et cetera. Oogami remarks that he was basically herded into sales because of his wolf heritage, with the implication that that really wasn't where his interest lay at all. Meanwhile the product development team is, prior to Oogami's arrival, entirely made up of herbivores, and mostly sheep at that. Alice, one of the women in the department, notes that other carnivores have been brought into the department only to be run right out when they couldn't control themselves around all of the sheep – something that Alice and two of her friends are very interested in replicating so that they can get rid of Oogami. They make attempts to railroad him into “biting” them, but none of them work because he's so invested in Mitsuji, which, somewhat ironically, is a large part of why Alice and the others want him gone. As sheep, they're very protective of their leader, Mitsuji, and that makes Oogami a threat to her safety in their eyes.    Part of the light humor of the book comes from the fact that despite their protestations of “I'm like this because I'm a wolf/sheep/cat/whatever,” most of the characters are acting against type. Oogami might want Mitsuji desperately, but he's also able to behave like a decent person around her because he doesn't want to ruin his chance with her. Mitsuji may find herself shaking in meetings with carnivores or inclined to take up as little space as possible, but she's also incredibly capable and actually pretty comfortable around just about everyone, regardless of species. Alice is certainly no wilting wallflower and is more proactive than Hyoukawa the black leopard when it comes to getting what she wants. The animal natures feel more like societal assumptions than anything more primordial, stand-ins for gender and social class markers dressed up with ears and tails in order to lightly poke at them.    And it is a light form of social parody, so much so that you could easily ignore that entire aspect in favor of simply focusing on the romantic comedy elements. Things like the way Oogami's tail wags enthusiastically without his awareness when he's talking to Mitsuji or Alice tracking down Mitsuji's whereabouts from a piece of tail fluff work with the animal factors nicely while still keeping things lighthearted and a little goofy, and plenty of the staples of office romance are in place, such as getting locked in the reference room (workplace manga's equivalent of the gym storage room), going out drinking with colleagues, and interdepartmental competition. Oogami's crush on Mitsuji is more or less an open secret (even Mitsuji has at least an idea that he likes her) and serves to not only drive the plot, but to allow the characters to air all of their ingrained assumptions about themselves and others in the same way that someone's work record determines their worth in non-animal-based office rom coms. The animal bits and pieces pop up in odd moments to remind us they're there, such as Mitsuji's latest project being a pillow for people with horns.    Interestingly enough, there really isn't much made of the fact that some of the sheep have horns and others don't, which, if you're as inclined to overthinking as I am, could have easily been used as a marker of breed; instead, it is treated here like curly versus straight hair – some people have one and some people have the other. Of course, there isn't a ton of artistic consistency across the book as horned sheep are sometimes drawn without their horns, so it may be less intentional than it at first appears. It's very nice to look at otherwise, and I definitely appreciate that Shimizu explains why characters have both animal ears and human ears; basically the animal ears are nonfunctional in terms of hearing, but are an evolutionary leftover that can serve as emotional expressions.    All in all, I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep! is a fun little story. It isn't reinventing the office rom com wheel, but it also doesn't need to – it's just a variation on the theme with cute animal elements, which includes a bit of wordplay with the characters' names and their respective animal ancestors. Largely devoid of mean humor and mostly fluffy, it's a nice light read when you just want a book to relax with.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B-  + Cute story and budding relationship, good use of tails to show emotions. − Art can be inconsistent, a bit thin on plot.            discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Shino Shimizu   Full encyclopedia details aboutI'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- Episode 3  by MrAJCosplay, Apr 24th 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- ?                     Community score: 4.5            Can I just say these kids are terrifying?  Not just because of the amount of psychological and manipulative power they seem to have over each other, but also because of their extreme disconnect with reality. I'm joking – mostly – and watching these teenagers operate under extremes, pretending they know more about everything going on than they actually do, is obviously a large part of Kaguya-sama's appeal. I guess I just wasn't expecting this episode to start as dark as it did; the opening scene where the girls are breaking down the concept of cheating with a dead, almost violent look in their eyes made me laugh nervously. That said, I like the fact that there is a narrative progression to the three skits that made up this episode, allowing them to flow from one into the other. The first skit set up a conflict that needed to be resolved, the second introduces a character involved in that conflict and their mindset with some foreshadowing for things to come, and the third built upon some of the best parts of last week's episode.    Although I guess it would be a bit of a stretch to say that the character in the second skit is new, considering that we have technically seen her in almost every single episode of the show. That's right: the girl in the background that is always stalking that one couple who represents how great things could have been if some of these characters were just honest with themselves is finally given a name. Suffice to say it's surprising that she holds some kind of connection with Kaguya by being a member of the Shinomiya branch family. The show makes it a point that they are distant relatives, but the fact that said connection is a defining feature of her introduction made me think that there will be bigger plans for her down the road, possibly relating to some of Kaguya's family struggles that were hinted at in previous seasons. I also appreciated how the final skit ended, which is not only wholesome, but capped this episode off as one of the most narratively consistent of the season so far.

Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- Episode 3  by MrAJCosplay, Apr 24th 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- ?                     Community score: 4.5            Can I just say these kids are terrifying?  Not just because of the amount of psychological and manipulative power they seem to have over each other, but also because of their extreme disconnect with reality. I'm joking – mostly – and watching these teenagers operate under extremes, pretending they know more about everything going on than they actually do, is obviously a large part of Kaguya-sama's appeal. I guess I just wasn't expecting this episode to start as dark as it did; the opening scene where the girls are breaking down the concept of cheating with a dead, almost violent look in their eyes made me laugh nervously. That said, I like the fact that there is a narrative progression to the three skits that made up this episode, allowing them to flow from one into the other. The first skit set up a conflict that needed to be resolved, the second introduces a character involved in that conflict and their mindset with some foreshadowing for things to come, and the third built upon some of the best parts of last week's episode.    Although I guess it would be a bit of a stretch to say that the character in the second skit is new, considering that we have technically seen her in almost every single episode of the show. That's right: the girl in the background that is always stalking that one couple who represents how great things could have been if some of these characters were just honest with themselves is finally given a name. Suffice to say it's surprising that she holds some kind of connection with Kaguya by being a member of the Shinomiya branch family. The show makes it a point that they are distant relatives, but the fact that said connection is a defining feature of her introduction made me think that there will be bigger plans for her down the road, possibly relating to some of Kaguya's family struggles that were hinted at in previous seasons. I also appreciated how the final skit ended, which is not only wholesome, but capped this episode off as one of the most narratively consistent of the season so far.

Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- Episode 3  by MrAJCosplay, Apr 24th 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- ?                     Community score: 4.5            Can I just say these kids are terrifying?  Not just because of the amount of psychological and manipulative power they seem to have over each other, but also because of their extreme disconnect with reality. I'm joking – mostly – and watching these teenagers operate under extremes, pretending they know more about everything going on than they actually do, is obviously a large part of Kaguya-sama's appeal. I guess I just wasn't expecting this episode to start as dark as it did; the opening scene where the girls are breaking down the concept of cheating with a dead, almost violent look in their eyes made me laugh nervously. That said, I like the fact that there is a narrative progression to the three skits that made up this episode, allowing them to flow from one into the other. The first skit set up a conflict that needed to be resolved, the second introduces a character involved in that conflict and their mindset with some foreshadowing for things to come, and the third built upon some of the best parts of last week's episode.    Although I guess it would be a bit of a stretch to say that the character in the second skit is new, considering that we have technically seen her in almost every single episode of the show. That's right: the girl in the background that is always stalking that one couple who represents how great things could have been if some of these characters were just honest with themselves is finally given a name. Suffice to say it's surprising that she holds some kind of connection with Kaguya by being a member of the Shinomiya branch family. The show makes it a point that they are distant relatives, but the fact that said connection is a defining feature of her introduction made me think that there will be bigger plans for her down the road, possibly relating to some of Kaguya's family struggles that were hinted at in previous seasons. I also appreciated how the final skit ended, which is not only wholesome, but capped this episode off as one of the most narratively consistent of the season so far.

News Live-Action My Boyfriend in Orange Film's Trailer Reveals More Cast, Theme Song   posted on 2022-04-26 09:43 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Snow Man sings theme song ""Orange Kiss"" for July 18 film    The official website for the live-action film of Non Tamashima's My Boyfriend in Orange (Moekare wa Orange-iro) manga unveiled the full trailer and poster for the film on Tuesday. The trailer reveals and previews the film's theme song ""Orange Kiss"" by the idol group Snow Man, and also reveals new cast members for the film.          The new cast members include:     Jin Suzuki as Kōsei Himeno, Ebihara's colleague and rival  Shuhei Uesugi as Shinichirō Kazama, Ebihara's colleague  Hidaka Ukisho as Genki Kojima, Ebihara's subordinate   Yūta Furukawa as Kazuma Shindō, Ebihara's superior  Taiyu Fujiwara as Shūto Mitaka, Moe's classmate   Riko Nagase as Sayumi Kiritani, Moe's classmate    Kodansha Comics is publishing the manga digitally in English, and it describes the story:  Hot firemen, now in the world of shojo manga! High school student Moe has moved to a new town after the death of her father. Moe's already having enough trouble fitting into her new class as it is, so she's totally mortified when she ends up being “rescued” by local firefighter Kyōsuke during a fire drill … in front of all the kids at school. But the embarrassing incident might be a blessing in disguise, because gruff-but-kind Kyōsuke gives Moe the courage she needs to leap out of her comfort zone as she aims to leave her loner days behind. Not to mention she's soon falling head over heels for him … !  The film will open on July 18. Snow Man idol group member Hikaru Iwamoto and model Meru Nukumi star in the film as the firefighter Kyōsuke Ebihara and the high school student Moe Sasaki, respectively.    Shōsuke Murakami (live-action One Week Friends, Promise Cinderella) is directing the film, and Junpei Yamaoka (Kishiryu Sentai Ryusoulger, live-action Peach Girl, Honey So Sweet) wrote the script. Shochiku is distributing the film.    The manga launched in Kodansha's Dessert magazine in May 2016, and Kodansha published the 12th compiled volume on April 13. Kodansha Comics published the 11th volume in English in December.

News Live-Action My Boyfriend in Orange Film's Trailer Reveals More Cast, Theme Song   posted on 2022-04-26 09:43 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Snow Man sings theme song ""Orange Kiss"" for July 18 film    The official website for the live-action film of Non Tamashima's My Boyfriend in Orange (Moekare wa Orange-iro) manga unveiled the full trailer and poster for the film on Tuesday. The trailer reveals and previews the film's theme song ""Orange Kiss"" by the idol group Snow Man, and also reveals new cast members for the film.          The new cast members include:     Jin Suzuki as Kōsei Himeno, Ebihara's colleague and rival  Shuhei Uesugi as Shinichirō Kazama, Ebihara's colleague  Hidaka Ukisho as Genki Kojima, Ebihara's subordinate   Yūta Furukawa as Kazuma Shindō, Ebihara's superior  Taiyu Fujiwara as Shūto Mitaka, Moe's classmate   Riko Nagase as Sayumi Kiritani, Moe's classmate    Kodansha Comics is publishing the manga digitally in English, and it describes the story:  Hot firemen, now in the world of shojo manga! High school student Moe has moved to a new town after the death of her father. Moe's already having enough trouble fitting into her new class as it is, so she's totally mortified when she ends up being “rescued” by local firefighter Kyōsuke during a fire drill … in front of all the kids at school. But the embarrassing incident might be a blessing in disguise, because gruff-but-kind Kyōsuke gives Moe the courage she needs to leap out of her comfort zone as she aims to leave her loner days behind. Not to mention she's soon falling head over heels for him … !  The film will open on July 18. Snow Man idol group member Hikaru Iwamoto and model Meru Nukumi star in the film as the firefighter Kyōsuke Ebihara and the high school student Moe Sasaki, respectively.    Shōsuke Murakami (live-action One Week Friends, Promise Cinderella) is directing the film, and Junpei Yamaoka (Kishiryu Sentai Ryusoulger, live-action Peach Girl, Honey So Sweet) wrote the script. Shochiku is distributing the film.    The manga launched in Kodansha's Dessert magazine in May 2016, and Kodansha published the 12th compiled volume on April 13. Kodansha Comics published the 11th volume in English in December.

News Live-Action My Boyfriend in Orange Film's Trailer Reveals More Cast, Theme Song   posted on 2022-04-26 09:43 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Snow Man sings theme song ""Orange Kiss"" for July 18 film    The official website for the live-action film of Non Tamashima's My Boyfriend in Orange (Moekare wa Orange-iro) manga unveiled the full trailer and poster for the film on Tuesday.

But the embarrassing incident might be a blessing in disguise, because gruff-but-kind Kyōsuke gives Moe the courage she needs to leap out of her comfort zone as she aims to leave her loner days behind. Not to mention she's soon falling head over heels for him … !  The film will open on July 18. Snow Man idol group member Hikaru Iwamoto and model Meru Nukumi star in the film as the firefighter Kyōsuke Ebihara and the high school student Moe Sasaki, respectively.

I'm genuinely enjoying it, and there's some smart writing underlying it that really makes it tick! What's particularly fun is how the protag calls out the mediocrity of many gaming tropes, he's saying what we all think, what a bro!

It's generally just really funny.    The anime so far is just OK. Not terrible but not especially great either. Considering the pacing I'd say they are doing pretty good and while the animation isn't amazing it's at least been serviceable so far but I guess we'll see what happens next week.   One issue with the pacing is the fact that some details from the novel have been skimmed over. For one thing despite how it seems in the anime, the kingdom isn't really misandrist. While women do generally hold more power, among the highest-ranking nobles men still run the show which is why the prince and his entourage don't have to deal with the same nonsense Leon does.

Hopefully that will be the show going forward.

As anyone who has been in development knows, this is the crap that comes out when someone from Corp says ""hey, this fujioshi (sic) thing is taking off, we need to be in that market"", then development says, ""we do sci-fi games, we don't do dating sims"", to which the reply goes ""just throw in some mean chicks and pretty boys and get it done ASAP"".  So you have a repurposed sci-fi game (hey the code is half done, you are not going to throw it away) by people who only know the stereotypes of otome games.

I've only read some of the manga but, uh, I'm not buying it. If that were the primary intent, the author could've approached it any number of other ways. They could've had a female protagonist who liked otome games in general but hated this one. Or they could've had a male protagonist who was playing this one for some reason other than one designed specifically to justify outrage against a female character. Like, I dunno, if he just wanted to keep up with what his sister/girlfriend/whatever was into. (And who played to the end out of stubbornness instead of coercion.) And they could've called it something other than ""The World of an Otome Game is Tough for Mobs"", which places the focus specifically on the fact that it is an otome game's world, and frames that as the source of all that is objectionable.   (Also, from what I understand, ""people who only know the stereotypes of otome games"" pretty well describes just about every author of a Narou story set in one, this story included.)   I've seen another Narou story where the whole joke is that the game is terrible -- ""I Am the Only One Who Knows This World Is a Game"". It makes an interesting contrast with this one in its approach and focus -- it's funnier, with less of a persecution complex underlying it.

Anyway, still looking forward to watching more, though with fewer surprises unfortunately.   The scale of the mechs in the arena looked really off to me when I watched it btw, and as you'd expect, they're scaled a lot better in the manga. Not sure how it is in the LN, but obviously it doesn't make sense to fight in an arena with mechs that are taller than it. Hopefully that gets adjusted for next week or that fight will look really off      Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant           Nice addition, I hope this feature is included often lol      Back to top                  Melicans    Joined: 01 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 580 		    Location: Canada 		        Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:06 pm            I doubt the series will get that far but Marie's backstory is actually really sad. Both previous life and current. I noticed this in episode 3, but her design is actually really well done too. She looks different from the rest of the characters from the game. Not just in stature or build, but as a character in an otome game she looks out of place compared to anyone else. It's a really nice visual aspect added to compliment her out of placeness.

The author has stated that the story was inspired by other otome isekai stories but the game in this story isn't meant to be based on an actual otome game. The whole men having less power thing was more about adding to the entertainment value to story. There is an actual explanation for it in universe however.   Anyways this story is less about Leon being treated like crap and more about Leon pissing people off for various reasons. We haven't seen alot of that but as we saw at the end of this week's episode it's coming. Trust me Leon is many things but he is not a victim.

As someone who also only read the manga, I have to disagree, the title indeed a mocking title, but the part it mocking is the ""Tough"" part. It's more a story about how Leon keep failing at been a nameless mook and keep getting the spotlight despite his best attempt at failing.   Side not: It's nice that they adapted one of the plot point that got mention in one of the side story. spoiler[The fact that Leon and Angelica are destined to be with each other. Like in the original plotline, Angelica would get banished by her family for her rash action and have to marry an ""ugly"" lord with bad personality. Well it turned out that ""ugly"" lord is the original Leon who did have to go war, got a scar but became a war hero.]      Back to top                  Thespacemaster    Joined: 03 Mar 2012 		    Posts: 834       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:40 pm              zztop wrote:       Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant #3: Humanity lives exclusively on a sea of flying islands.   • Nonsensical otome game remnant #4: A “KINGdom” in a land with absurd levels of misandry.

By doing so however the line between upper and lower class would be erased pretty much nullifying the nobility so that only the common classes remain. While this sounds like a good idea (no rich pansies) this would essentially lead to an absolute monarchy where only the royalty rules over the common classes, pretty much more akin to a dictatorship.   The extra backlash of this plan led to the nobility just not giving a shit when and if their country gets invaded by an enemy power, because if their government doesn't give a shit, why not give the next one a shot. So no sense of nationality.] Think I got it right, might be a little off from the translation.

So the higher nobility decided to focus the lower nobles attention toward marriage and social appearance, especially propaganda about how you have to marry a lady in a noble family for social advancement.

It's generally just really funny.    The anime so far is just OK. Not terrible but not especially great either. Considering the pacing I'd say they are doing pretty good and while the animation isn't amazing it's at least been serviceable so far but I guess we'll see what happens next week.   One issue with the pacing is the fact that some details from the novel have been skimmed over. For one thing despite how it seems in the anime, the kingdom isn't really misandrist. While women do generally hold more power, among the highest-ranking nobles men still run the show which is why the prince and his entourage don't have to deal with the same nonsense Leon does.

So you have a repurposed sci-fi game (hey the code is half done, you are not going to throw it away) by people who only know the stereotypes of otome games.            I've only read some of the manga but, uh, I'm not buying it. If that were the primary intent, the author could've approached it any number of other ways. They could've had a female protagonist who liked otome games in general but hated this one. Or they could've had a male protagonist who was playing this one for some reason other than one designed specifically to justify outrage against a female character. Like, I dunno, if he just wanted to keep up with what his sister/girlfriend/whatever was into. (And who played to the end out of stubbornness instead of coercion.) And they could've called it something other than ""The World of an Otome Game is Tough for Mobs"", which places the focus specifically on the fact that it is an otome game's world, and frames that as the source of all that is objectionable.   (Also, from what I understand, ""people who only know the stereotypes of otome games"" pretty well describes just about every author of a Narou story set in one, this story included.)   I've seen another Narou story where the whole joke is that the game is terrible -- ""I Am the Only One Who Knows This World Is a Game"". It makes an interesting contrast with this one in its approach and focus -- it's funnier, with less of a persecution complex underlying it.

Anyway, still looking forward to watching more, though with fewer surprises unfortunately.   The scale of the mechs in the arena looked really off to me when I watched it btw, and as you'd expect, they're scaled a lot better in the manga. Not sure how it is in the LN, but obviously it doesn't make sense to fight in an arena with mechs that are taller than it. Hopefully that gets adjusted for next week or that fight will look really off      Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant           Nice addition, I hope this feature is included often lol      Back to top                  Melicans    Joined: 01 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 580 		    Location: Canada 		        Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:06 pm            I doubt the series will get that far but Marie's backstory is actually really sad. Both previous life and current. I noticed this in episode 3, but her design is actually really well done too. She looks different from the rest of the characters from the game. Not just in stature or build, but as a character in an otome game she looks out of place compared to anyone else. It's a really nice visual aspect added to compliment her out of placeness.

So you have a repurposed sci-fi game (hey the code is half done, you are not going to throw it away) by people who only know the stereotypes of otome games.            I've only read some of the manga but, uh, I'm not buying it. If that were the primary intent, the author could've approached it any number of other ways. They could've had a female protagonist who liked otome games in general but hated this one. Or they could've had a male protagonist who was playing this one for some reason other than one designed specifically to justify outrage against a female character. Like, I dunno, if he just wanted to keep up with what his sister/girlfriend/whatever was into. (And who played to the end out of stubbornness instead of coercion.) And they could've called it something other than ""The World of an Otome Game is Tough for Mobs"", which places the focus specifically on the fact that it is an otome game's world, and frames that as the source of all that is objectionable.   (Also, from what I understand, ""people who only know the stereotypes of otome games"" pretty well describes just about every author of a Narou story set in one, this story included.)   I've seen another Narou story where the whole joke is that the game is terrible -- ""I Am the Only One Who Knows This World Is a Game"". It makes an interesting contrast with this one in its approach and focus -- it's funnier, with less of a persecution complex underlying it.            The author has stated that the story was inspired by other otome isekai stories but the game in this story isn't meant to be based on an actual otome game. The whole men having less power thing was more about adding to the entertainment value to story. There is an actual explanation for it in universe however.   Anyways this story is less about Leon being treated like crap and more about Leon pissing people off for various reasons. We haven't seen alot of that but as we saw at the end of this week's episode it's coming. Trust me Leon is many things but he is not a victim.

As someone who also only read the manga, I have to disagree, the title indeed a mocking title, but the part it mocking is the ""Tough"" part. It's more a story about how Leon keep failing at been a nameless mook and keep getting the spotlight despite his best attempt at failing.   Side not: It's nice that they adapted one of the plot point that got mention in one of the side story. spoiler[The fact that Leon and Angelica are destined to be with each other. Like in the original plotline, Angelica would get banished by her family for her rash action and have to marry an ""ugly"" lord with bad personality. Well it turned out that ""ugly"" lord is the original Leon who did have to go war, got a scar but became a war hero.]      Back to top                  Thespacemaster    Joined: 03 Mar 2012 		    Posts: 834       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:40 pm              zztop wrote:       Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant #3: Humanity lives exclusively on a sea of flying islands.   • Nonsensical otome game remnant #4: A “KINGdom” in a land with absurd levels of misandry.

By doing so however the line between upper and lower class would be erased pretty much nullifying the nobility so that only the common classes remain. While this sounds like a good idea (no rich pansies) this would essentially lead to an absolute monarchy where only the royalty rules over the common classes, pretty much more akin to a dictatorship.   The extra backlash of this plan led to the nobility just not giving a shit when and if their country gets invaded by an enemy power, because if their government doesn't give a shit, why not give the next one a shot. So no sense of nationality.] Think I got it right, might be a little off from the translation.

So the higher nobility decided to focus the lower nobles attention toward marriage and social appearance, especially propaganda about how you have to marry a lady in a noble family for social advancement. That why the misandry only appear in the lower nobles circle which Leon is a part of. However, no one in the present even remember why they set up a system like that in the first place, they just find it a useful tools to control the raising middle class.]      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1, 2  Next    Page 1 of 2         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

I'm genuinely enjoying it, and there's some smart writing underlying it that really makes it tick! What's particularly fun is how the protag calls out the mediocrity of many gaming tropes, he's saying what we all think, what a bro!      Back to top                  everydaygamer    Joined: 10 Jul 2009 		    Posts: 700       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 5:16 pm            After reading the first 5 translated novels I've become a real fan of this series. It's generally just really funny.    The anime so far is just OK. Not terrible but not especially great either. Considering the pacing I'd say they are doing pretty good and while the animation isn't amazing it's at least been serviceable so far but I guess we'll see what happens next week.   One issue with the pacing is the fact that some details from the novel have been skimmed over. For one thing despite how it seems in the anime, the kingdom isn't really misandrist. While women do generally hold more power, among the highest-ranking nobles men still run the show which is why the prince and his entourage don't have to deal with the same nonsense Leon does.

They could've had a female protagonist who liked otome games in general but hated this one. Or they could've had a male protagonist who was playing this one for some reason other than one designed specifically to justify outrage against a female character.

Anyway, still looking forward to watching more, though with fewer surprises unfortunately.   The scale of the mechs in the arena looked really off to me when I watched it btw, and as you'd expect, they're scaled a lot better in the manga. Not sure how it is in the LN, but obviously it doesn't make sense to fight in an arena with mechs that are taller than it. Hopefully that gets adjusted for next week or that fight will look really off      Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant           Nice addition, I hope this feature is included often lol      Back to top                  Melicans    Joined: 01 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 580 		    Location: Canada 		        Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:06 pm            I doubt the series will get that far but Marie's backstory is actually really sad. Both previous life and current. I noticed this in episode 3, but her design is actually really well done too. She looks different from the rest of the characters from the game. Not just in stature or build, but as a character in an otome game she looks out of place compared to anyone else. It's a really nice visual aspect added to compliment her out of placeness.

The author has stated that the story was inspired by other otome isekai stories but the game in this story isn't meant to be based on an actual otome game. The whole men having less power thing was more about adding to the entertainment value to story. There is an actual explanation for it in universe however.   Anyways this story is less about Leon being treated like crap and more about Leon pissing people off for various reasons. We haven't seen alot of that but as we saw at the end of this week's episode it's coming. Trust me Leon is many things but he is not a victim.

It's more a story about how Leon keep failing at been a nameless mook and keep getting the spotlight despite his best attempt at failing.   Side not: It's nice that they adapted one of the plot point that got mention in one of the side story. spoiler[The fact that Leon and Angelica are destined to be with each other.

By doing so however the line between upper and lower class would be erased pretty much nullifying the nobility so that only the common classes remain. While this sounds like a good idea (no rich pansies) this would essentially lead to an absolute monarchy where only the royalty rules over the common classes, pretty much more akin to a dictatorship.   The extra backlash of this plan led to the nobility just not giving a shit when and if their country gets invaded by an enemy power, because if their government doesn't give a shit, why not give the next one a shot. So no sense of nationality.] Think I got it right, might be a little off from the translation.

So the higher nobility decided to focus the lower nobles attention toward marriage and social appearance, especially propaganda about how you have to marry a lady in a noble family for social advancement. That why the misandry only appear in the lower nobles circle which Leon is a part of. However, no one in the present even remember why they set up a system like that in the first place, they just find it a useful tools to control the raising middle class.]      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1, 2  Next    Page 1 of 2         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

It's generally just really funny.    The anime so far is just OK. Not terrible but not especially great either. Considering the pacing I'd say they are doing pretty good and while the animation isn't amazing it's at least been serviceable so far but I guess we'll see what happens next week.   One issue with the pacing is the fact that some details from the novel have been skimmed over. For one thing despite how it seems in the anime, the kingdom isn't really misandrist. While women do generally hold more power, among the highest-ranking nobles men still run the show which is why the prince and his entourage don't have to deal with the same nonsense Leon does.

So you have a repurposed sci-fi game (hey the code is half done, you are not going to throw it away) by people who only know the stereotypes of otome games.            I've only read some of the manga but, uh, I'm not buying it. If that were the primary intent, the author could've approached it any number of other ways. They could've had a female protagonist who liked otome games in general but hated this one. Or they could've had a male protagonist who was playing this one for some reason other than one designed specifically to justify outrage against a female character. Like, I dunno, if he just wanted to keep up with what his sister/girlfriend/whatever was into. (And who played to the end out of stubbornness instead of coercion.) And they could've called it something other than ""The World of an Otome Game is Tough for Mobs"", which places the focus specifically on the fact that it is an otome game's world, and frames that as the source of all that is objectionable.   (Also, from what I understand, ""people who only know the stereotypes of otome games"" pretty well describes just about every author of a Narou story set in one, this story included.)   I've seen another Narou story where the whole joke is that the game is terrible -- ""I Am the Only One Who Knows This World Is a Game"". It makes an interesting contrast with this one in its approach and focus -- it's funnier, with less of a persecution complex underlying it.

Anyway, still looking forward to watching more, though with fewer surprises unfortunately.   The scale of the mechs in the arena looked really off to me when I watched it btw, and as you'd expect, they're scaled a lot better in the manga. Not sure how it is in the LN, but obviously it doesn't make sense to fight in an arena with mechs that are taller than it. Hopefully that gets adjusted for next week or that fight will look really off      Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant           Nice addition, I hope this feature is included often lol      Back to top                  Melicans    Joined: 01 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 580 		    Location: Canada 		        Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:06 pm            I doubt the series will get that far but Marie's backstory is actually really sad. Both previous life and current. I noticed this in episode 3, but her design is actually really well done too. She looks different from the rest of the characters from the game. Not just in stature or build, but as a character in an otome game she looks out of place compared to anyone else. It's a really nice visual aspect added to compliment her out of placeness.

The author has stated that the story was inspired by other otome isekai stories but the game in this story isn't meant to be based on an actual otome game. The whole men having less power thing was more about adding to the entertainment value to story. There is an actual explanation for it in universe however.   Anyways this story is less about Leon being treated like crap and more about Leon pissing people off for various reasons. We haven't seen alot of that but as we saw at the end of this week's episode it's coming. Trust me Leon is many things but he is not a victim.

As someone who also only read the manga, I have to disagree, the title indeed a mocking title, but the part it mocking is the ""Tough"" part. It's more a story about how Leon keep failing at been a nameless mook and keep getting the spotlight despite his best attempt at failing.   Side not: It's nice that they adapted one of the plot point that got mention in one of the side story. spoiler[The fact that Leon and Angelica are destined to be with each other. Like in the original plotline, Angelica would get banished by her family for her rash action and have to marry an ""ugly"" lord with bad personality. Well it turned out that ""ugly"" lord is the original Leon who did have to go war, got a scar but became a war hero.]      Back to top                  Thespacemaster    Joined: 03 Mar 2012 		    Posts: 834       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:40 pm              zztop wrote:       Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant #3: Humanity lives exclusively on a sea of flying islands.   • Nonsensical otome game remnant #4: A “KINGdom” in a land with absurd levels of misandry.

By doing so however the line between upper and lower class would be erased pretty much nullifying the nobility so that only the common classes remain. While this sounds like a good idea (no rich pansies) this would essentially lead to an absolute monarchy where only the royalty rules over the common classes, pretty much more akin to a dictatorship.   The extra backlash of this plan led to the nobility just not giving a shit when and if their country gets invaded by an enemy power, because if their government doesn't give a shit, why not give the next one a shot. So no sense of nationality.] Think I got it right, might be a little off from the translation.

So the higher nobility decided to focus the lower nobles attention toward marriage and social appearance, especially propaganda about how you have to marry a lady in a noble family for social advancement. That why the misandry only appear in the lower nobles circle which Leon is a part of. However, no one in the present even remember why they set up a system like that in the first place, they just find it a useful tools to control the raising middle class.]      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1, 2  Next    Page 1 of 2         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

It's generally just really funny.    The anime so far is just OK. Not terrible but not especially great either. Considering the pacing I'd say they are doing pretty good and while the animation isn't amazing it's at least been serviceable so far but I guess we'll see what happens next week.   One issue with the pacing is the fact that some details from the novel have been skimmed over. For one thing despite how it seems in the anime, the kingdom isn't really misandrist. While women do generally hold more power, among the highest-ranking nobles men still run the show which is why the prince and his entourage don't have to deal with the same nonsense Leon does.

Anyway, still looking forward to watching more, though with fewer surprises unfortunately.   The scale of the mechs in the arena looked really off to me when I watched it btw, and as you'd expect, they're scaled a lot better in the manga. Not sure how it is in the LN, but obviously it doesn't make sense to fight in an arena with mechs that are taller than it. Hopefully that gets adjusted for next week or that fight will look really off      Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant           Nice addition, I hope this feature is included often lol      Back to top                  Melicans    Joined: 01 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 580 		    Location: Canada 		        Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:06 pm            I doubt the series will get that far but Marie's backstory is actually really sad. Both previous life and current. I noticed this in episode 3, but her design is actually really well done too. She looks different from the rest of the characters from the game. Not just in stature or build, but as a character in an otome game she looks out of place compared to anyone else. It's a really nice visual aspect added to compliment her out of placeness.

So you have a repurposed sci-fi game (hey the code is half done, you are not going to throw it away) by people who only know the stereotypes of otome games.            I've only read some of the manga but, uh, I'm not buying it. If that were the primary intent, the author could've approached it any number of other ways. They could've had a female protagonist who liked otome games in general but hated this one. Or they could've had a male protagonist who was playing this one for some reason other than one designed specifically to justify outrage against a female character. Like, I dunno, if he just wanted to keep up with what his sister/girlfriend/whatever was into. (And who played to the end out of stubbornness instead of coercion.) And they could've called it something other than ""The World of an Otome Game is Tough for Mobs"", which places the focus specifically on the fact that it is an otome game's world, and frames that as the source of all that is objectionable.   (Also, from what I understand, ""people who only know the stereotypes of otome games"" pretty well describes just about every author of a Narou story set in one, this story included.)

The author has stated that the story was inspired by other otome isekai stories but the game in this story isn't meant to be based on an actual otome game. The whole men having less power thing was more about adding to the entertainment value to story. There is an actual explanation for it in universe however.   Anyways this story is less about Leon being treated like crap and more about Leon pissing people off for various reasons. We haven't seen alot of that but as we saw at the end of this week's episode it's coming. Trust me Leon is many things but he is not a victim.

So the higher nobility decided to focus the lower nobles attention toward marriage and social appearance, especially propaganda about how you have to marry a lady in a noble family for social advancement. That why the misandry only appear in the lower nobles circle which Leon is a part of. However, no one in the present even remember why they set up a system like that in the first place, they just find it a useful tools to control the raising middle class.]      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1, 2  Next    Page 1 of 2         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",negative,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://www.phpbb.com/': 1}"

I'm genuinely enjoying it, and there's some smart writing underlying it that really makes it tick! What's particularly fun is how the protag calls out the mediocrity of many gaming tropes, he's saying what we all think, what a bro!

It's generally just really funny.    The anime so far is just OK. Not terrible but not especially great either. Considering the pacing I'd say they are doing pretty good and while the animation isn't amazing it's at least been serviceable so far but I guess we'll see what happens next week.   One issue with the pacing is the fact that some details from the novel have been skimmed over. For one thing despite how it seems in the anime, the kingdom isn't really misandrist. While women do generally hold more power, among the highest-ranking nobles men still run the show which is why the prince and his entourage don't have to deal with the same nonsense Leon does.

It's generally just really funny.    The anime so far is just OK. Not terrible but not especially great either. Considering the pacing I'd say they are doing pretty good and while the animation isn't amazing it's at least been serviceable so far but I guess we'll see what happens next week.   One issue with the pacing is the fact that some details from the novel have been skimmed over. For one thing despite how it seems in the anime, the kingdom isn't really misandrist. While women do generally hold more power, among the highest-ranking nobles men still run the show which is why the prince and his entourage don't have to deal with the same nonsense Leon does.

I've only read some of the manga but, uh, I'm not buying it. If that were the primary intent, the author could've approached it any number of other ways. They could've had a female protagonist who liked otome games in general but hated this one. Or they could've had a male protagonist who was playing this one for some reason other than one designed specifically to justify outrage against a female character. Like, I dunno, if he just wanted to keep up with what his sister/girlfriend/whatever was into. (And who played to the end out of stubbornness instead of coercion.) And they could've called it something other than ""The World of an Otome Game is Tough for Mobs"", which places the focus specifically on the fact that it is an otome game's world, and frames that as the source of all that is objectionable.   (Also, from what I understand, ""people who only know the stereotypes of otome games"" pretty well describes just about every author of a Narou story set in one, this story included.)   I've seen another Narou story where the whole joke is that the game is terrible -- ""I Am the Only One Who Knows This World Is a Game"". It makes an interesting contrast with this one in its approach and focus -- it's funnier, with less of a persecution complex underlying it.

Anyway, still looking forward to watching more, though with fewer surprises unfortunately.   The scale of the mechs in the arena looked really off to me when I watched it btw, and as you'd expect, they're scaled a lot better in the manga. Not sure how it is in the LN, but obviously it doesn't make sense to fight in an arena with mechs that are taller than it. Hopefully that gets adjusted for next week or that fight will look really off      Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant           Nice addition, I hope this feature is included often lol      Back to top                  Melicans    Joined: 01 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 580 		    Location: Canada 		        Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:06 pm            I doubt the series will get that far but Marie's backstory is actually really sad. Both previous life and current. I noticed this in episode 3, but her design is actually really well done too. She looks different from the rest of the characters from the game. Not just in stature or build, but as a character in an otome game she looks out of place compared to anyone else. It's a really nice visual aspect added to compliment her out of placeness.

The author has stated that the story was inspired by other otome isekai stories but the game in this story isn't meant to be based on an actual otome game. The whole men having less power thing was more about adding to the entertainment value to story. There is an actual explanation for it in universe however.   Anyways this story is less about Leon being treated like crap and more about Leon pissing people off for various reasons. We haven't seen alot of that but as we saw at the end of this week's episode it's coming. Trust me Leon is many things but he is not a victim.

As someone who also only read the manga, I have to disagree, the title indeed a mocking title, but the part it mocking is the ""Tough"" part. It's more a story about how Leon keep failing at been a nameless mook and keep getting the spotlight despite his best attempt at failing.   Side not: It's nice that they adapted one of the plot point that got mention in one of the side story. spoiler[The fact that Leon and Angelica are destined to be with each other. Like in the original plotline, Angelica would get banished by her family for her rash action and have to marry an ""ugly"" lord with bad personality. Well it turned out that ""ugly"" lord is the original Leon who did have to go war, got a scar but became a war hero.]      Back to top                  Thespacemaster    Joined: 03 Mar 2012 		    Posts: 834       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:40 pm              zztop wrote:       Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant #3: Humanity lives exclusively on a sea of flying islands.   • Nonsensical otome game remnant #4: A “KINGdom” in a land with absurd levels of misandry.

Anyway, still looking forward to watching more, though with fewer surprises unfortunately.   The scale of the mechs in the arena looked really off to me when I watched it btw, and as you'd expect, they're scaled a lot better in the manga. Not sure how it is in the LN, but obviously it doesn't make sense to fight in an arena with mechs that are taller than it. Hopefully that gets adjusted for next week or that fight will look really off      Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant           Nice addition, I hope this feature is included often lol      Back to top                  Melicans    Joined: 01 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 580 		    Location: Canada 		        Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:06 pm            I doubt the series will get that far but Marie's backstory is actually really sad. Both previous life and current. I noticed this in episode 3, but her design is actually really well done too. She looks different from the rest of the characters from the game. Not just in stature or build, but as a character in an otome game she looks out of place compared to anyone else. It's a really nice visual aspect added to compliment her out of placeness.

So you have a repurposed sci-fi game (hey the code is half done, you are not going to throw it away) by people who only know the stereotypes of otome games.            I've only read some of the manga but, uh, I'm not buying it. If that were the primary intent, the author could've approached it any number of other ways. They could've had a female protagonist who liked otome games in general but hated this one. Or they could've had a male protagonist who was playing this one for some reason other than one designed specifically to justify outrage against a female character. Like, I dunno, if he just wanted to keep up with what his sister/girlfriend/whatever was into. (And who played to the end out of stubbornness instead of coercion.) And they could've called it something other than ""The World of an Otome Game is Tough for Mobs"", which places the focus specifically on the fact that it is an otome game's world, and frames that as the source of all that is objectionable.

The whole men having less power thing was more about adding to the entertainment value to story. There is an actual explanation for it in universe however.   Anyways this story is less about Leon being treated like crap and more about Leon pissing people off for various reasons. We haven't seen alot of that but as we saw at the end of this week's episode it's coming. Trust me Leon is many things but he is not a victim.

So the higher nobility decided to focus the lower nobles attention toward marriage and social appearance, especially propaganda about how you have to marry a lady in a noble family for social advancement. That why the misandry only appear in the lower nobles circle which Leon is a part of. However, no one in the present even remember why they set up a system like that in the first place, they just find it a useful tools to control the raising middle class.]      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1, 2  Next    Page 1 of 2         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group     ",negative,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://www.phpbb.com/': 1}"

What's particularly fun is how the protag calls out the mediocrity of many gaming tropes, he's saying what we all think, what a bro!

It's generally just really funny.    The anime so far is just OK. Not terrible but not especially great either. Considering the pacing I'd say they are doing pretty good and while the animation isn't amazing it's at least been serviceable so far but I guess we'll see what happens next week.   One issue with the pacing is the fact that some details from the novel have been skimmed over. For one thing despite how it seems in the anime, the kingdom isn't really misandrist. While women do generally hold more power, among the highest-ranking nobles men still run the show which is why the prince and his entourage don't have to deal with the same nonsense Leon does.

I'm genuinely enjoying it, and there's some smart writing underlying it that really makes it tick! What's particularly fun is how the protag calls out the mediocrity of many gaming tropes, he's saying what we all think, what a bro!

It's generally just really funny.    The anime so far is just OK. Not terrible but not especially great either. Considering the pacing I'd say they are doing pretty good and while the animation isn't amazing it's at least been serviceable so far but I guess we'll see what happens next week.   One issue with the pacing is the fact that some details from the novel have been skimmed over. For one thing despite how it seems in the anime, the kingdom isn't really misandrist. While women do generally hold more power, among the highest-ranking nobles men still run the show which is why the prince and his entourage don't have to deal with the same nonsense Leon does.

So you have a repurposed sci-fi game (hey the code is half done, you are not going to throw it away) by people who only know the stereotypes of otome games.            I've only read some of the manga but, uh, I'm not buying it. If that were the primary intent, the author could've approached it any number of other ways. They could've had a female protagonist who liked otome games in general but hated this one. Or they could've had a male protagonist who was playing this one for some reason other than one designed specifically to justify outrage against a female character. Like, I dunno, if he just wanted to keep up with what his sister/girlfriend/whatever was into. (And who played to the end out of stubbornness instead of coercion.) And they could've called it something other than ""The World of an Otome Game is Tough for Mobs"", which places the focus specifically on the fact that it is an otome game's world, and frames that as the source of all that is objectionable.   (Also, from what I understand, ""people who only know the stereotypes of otome games"" pretty well describes just about every author of a Narou story set in one, this story included.)   I've seen another Narou story where the whole joke is that the game is terrible -- ""I Am the Only One Who Knows This World Is a Game"". It makes an interesting contrast with this one in its approach and focus -- it's funnier, with less of a persecution complex underlying it.

Anyway, still looking forward to watching more, though with fewer surprises unfortunately.   The scale of the mechs in the arena looked really off to me when I watched it btw, and as you'd expect, they're scaled a lot better in the manga. Not sure how it is in the LN, but obviously it doesn't make sense to fight in an arena with mechs that are taller than it. Hopefully that gets adjusted for next week or that fight will look really off      Quote:    Nonsensical otome game remnant           Nice addition, I hope this feature is included often lol      Back to top                  Melicans    Joined: 01 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 580 		    Location: Canada 		        Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:06 pm            I doubt the series will get that far but Marie's backstory is actually really sad. Both previous life and current. I noticed this in episode 3, but her design is actually really well done too. She looks different from the rest of the characters from the game. Not just in stature or build, but as a character in an otome game she looks out of place compared to anyone else. It's a really nice visual aspect added to compliment her out of placeness.

The author has stated that the story was inspired by other otome isekai stories but the game in this story isn't meant to be based on an actual otome game. The whole men having less power thing was more about adding to the entertainment value to story. There is an actual explanation for it in universe however.   Anyways this story is less about Leon being treated like crap and more about Leon pissing people off for various reasons. We haven't seen alot of that but as we saw at the end of this week's episode it's coming. Trust me Leon is many things but he is not a victim.

As someone who also only read the manga, I have to disagree, the title indeed a mocking title, but the part it mocking is the ""Tough"" part. It's more a story about how Leon keep failing at been a nameless mook and keep getting the spotlight despite his best attempt at failing.   Side not: It's nice that they adapted one of the plot point that got mention in one of the side story. spoiler[The fact that Leon and Angelica are destined to be with each other. Like in the original plotline, Angelica would get banished by her family for her rash action and have to marry an ""ugly"" lord with bad personality.

By doing so however the line between upper and lower class would be erased pretty much nullifying the nobility so that only the common classes remain. While this sounds like a good idea (no rich pansies) this would essentially lead to an absolute monarchy where only the royalty rules over the common classes, pretty much more akin to a dictatorship.   The extra backlash of this plan led to the nobility just not giving a shit when and if their country gets invaded by an enemy power, because if their government doesn't give a shit, why not give the next one a shot.

Skeleton Knight in Another World Episode 3  by Richard Eisenbeis, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 4.1           Now that we're three episodes in it's safe to say we've established the status quo and here it is: as far as fantasy worlds go, this one objectively sucks to live in. Bandits rape and pillage with near impunity while nobles enslave women and release monsters upon the commoners for their own meager political gains. Rather than a high fantasy world, this one seems much closer to a dark fantasy world—though its clear that Arc is ignorant of this fact. He still sees himself as an RPG protagonist so it makes sense that he runs into conflict everywhere he looks. It doesn't occur to him that the amount of bad stuff he has encountered is the norm for people in this world rather than the exception—which brings us to Ariane.    Ariane is well aware of the nature of her world—and as an elf (specifically a dark elf), she is more privy to its crapsack side than most. While her people are supposedly at peace with the humans, it doesn't stop bandits from kidnapping and enslaving pretty much every elf they come across. As one of the warriors of her kind, it is her job to protect her people—which is something of a loosing battle at this point. It's no surprise that she's jaded and believes all humans are inherently evil liars given her experiences. Arc has got to be the strangest person she has ever met—and not just because of his breadth of powerful magic and skills.    In a world where those with power selfishly abuse it, Arc is the rare individual who uses his for good. What's more is that he does good not for any kind of reward or prestige (aside from the meager funds he needs for room and board) but literally for the joy of doing good. Arc is an adventurer in the truest sense. He simply wants to go on adventures—righting wrongs and helping the downtrodden in the process. His whole life he has played at being this kind of hero in video games but now it's his chance to do it for real.    This is what gives the show its conflicting tones: Horrible stuff is happening constantly in this world yet Arc is still upbeat about the whole thing. The show even acknowledges this through Ariane's reactions to Arc—she is thrown off balance by the way he acts. Yet, these conflicting tones are not a bad thing. While Arc's disconnection from the reality he faces can cause problems, it can also be a source for inspiration. His selfless actions in helping the elven children clearly change Ariane's views on humans enough for her to ask him for his help. And in a more meta sense, it gives the show both some levity to offset its often dark subject matter and provide some good setups for fish-out-of-water humor.    In the most general sense, Arc is an unshakable optimist in a pessimistic world. What's more, his optimism is infectious—spreading to those he befriends. He may not be saving the world in the traditional sense (at least, not yet) but he is saving little pieces of it, making life better for the poor and oppressed he encounters.    Rating:                Random Thoughts   •	So Arc just basically reenacted the final scene of Rogue One on those unarmed bandits. He clearly has zero qualms about killing “bad” people (which has some potentially troubling implications).    •	Ponta was totally down for all that bandit mass murder.    •	I'm unsure whether Arc killed the sadistic noble heir or not. If he did, he's just made a powerful enemy—though Arc looks to be on his way to taking him down anyway just by helping Ariane.    •	While the show clearly doesn't have an insane budget, I like the way they are mixing the CG and 2D animation for the best effect—i.e., 2D for the close ups, CG for the wide shots.    •	More fantasy adventures should have power metal openings. Or better yet, Viking metal openings.    •	I also love how the opening is a mini-adventure and contains both sound effects and voice acting.

Skeleton Knight in Another World Episode 3  by Richard Eisenbeis, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 4.1           Now that we're three episodes in it's safe to say we've established the status quo and here it is: as far as fantasy worlds go, this one objectively sucks to live in. Bandits rape and pillage with near impunity while nobles enslave women and release monsters upon the commoners for their own meager political gains. Rather than a high fantasy world, this one seems much closer to a dark fantasy world—though its clear that Arc is ignorant of this fact. He still sees himself as an RPG protagonist so it makes sense that he runs into conflict everywhere he looks. It doesn't occur to him that the amount of bad stuff he has encountered is the norm for people in this world rather than the exception—which brings us to Ariane.    Ariane is well aware of the nature of her world—and as an elf (specifically a dark elf), she is more privy to its crapsack side than most. While her people are supposedly at peace with the humans, it doesn't stop bandits from kidnapping and enslaving pretty much every elf they come across. As one of the warriors of her kind, it is her job to protect her people—which is something of a loosing battle at this point. It's no surprise that she's jaded and believes all humans are inherently evil liars given her experiences. Arc has got to be the strangest person she has ever met—and not just because of his breadth of powerful magic and skills.    In a world where those with power selfishly abuse it, Arc is the rare individual who uses his for good. What's more is that he does good not for any kind of reward or prestige (aside from the meager funds he needs for room and board) but literally for the joy of doing good. Arc is an adventurer in the truest sense. He simply wants to go on adventures—righting wrongs and helping the downtrodden in the process. His whole life he has played at being this kind of hero in video games but now it's his chance to do it for real.    This is what gives the show its conflicting tones: Horrible stuff is happening constantly in this world yet Arc is still upbeat about the whole thing. The show even acknowledges this through Ariane's reactions to Arc—she is thrown off balance by the way he acts. Yet, these conflicting tones are not a bad thing. While Arc's disconnection from the reality he faces can cause problems, it can also be a source for inspiration. His selfless actions in helping the elven children clearly change Ariane's views on humans enough for her to ask him for his help. And in a more meta sense, it gives the show both some levity to offset its often dark subject matter and provide some good setups for fish-out-of-water humor.    In the most general sense, Arc is an unshakable optimist in a pessimistic world. What's more, his optimism is infectious—spreading to those he befriends. He may not be saving the world in the traditional sense (at least, not yet) but he is saving little pieces of it, making life better for the poor and oppressed he encounters.    Rating:                Random Thoughts   •	So Arc just basically reenacted the final scene of Rogue One on those unarmed bandits. He clearly has zero qualms about killing “bad” people (which has some potentially troubling implications).    •	Ponta was totally down for all that bandit mass murder.    •	I'm unsure whether Arc killed the sadistic noble heir or not. If he did, he's just made a powerful enemy—though Arc looks to be on his way to taking him down anyway just by helping Ariane.    •	While the show clearly doesn't have an insane budget, I like the way they are mixing the CG and 2D animation for the best effect—i.e., 2D for the close ups, CG for the wide shots.    •	More fantasy adventures should have power metal openings. Or better yet, Viking metal openings.    •	I also love how the opening is a mini-adventure and contains both sound effects and voice acting.

Skeleton Knight in Another World Episode 3  by Richard Eisenbeis, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 4.1           Now that we're three episodes in it's safe to say we've established the status quo and here it is: as far as fantasy worlds go, this one objectively sucks to live in. Bandits rape and pillage with near impunity while nobles enslave women and release monsters upon the commoners for their own meager political gains. Rather than a high fantasy world, this one seems much closer to a dark fantasy world—though its clear that Arc is ignorant of this fact. He still sees himself as an RPG protagonist so it makes sense that he runs into conflict everywhere he looks. It doesn't occur to him that the amount of bad stuff he has encountered is the norm for people in this world rather than the exception—which brings us to Ariane.    Ariane is well aware of the nature of her world—and as an elf (specifically a dark elf), she is more privy to its crapsack side than most. While her people are supposedly at peace with the humans, it doesn't stop bandits from kidnapping and enslaving pretty much every elf they come across. As one of the warriors of her kind, it is her job to protect her people—which is something of a loosing battle at this point. It's no surprise that she's jaded and believes all humans are inherently evil liars given her experiences. Arc has got to be the strangest person she has ever met—and not just because of his breadth of powerful magic and skills.    In a world where those with power selfishly abuse it, Arc is the rare individual who uses his for good. What's more is that he does good not for any kind of reward or prestige (aside from the meager funds he needs for room and board) but literally for the joy of doing good. Arc is an adventurer in the truest sense. He simply wants to go on adventures—righting wrongs and helping the downtrodden in the process. His whole life he has played at being this kind of hero in video games but now it's his chance to do it for real.    This is what gives the show its conflicting tones: Horrible stuff is happening constantly in this world yet Arc is still upbeat about the whole thing. The show even acknowledges this through Ariane's reactions to Arc—she is thrown off balance by the way he acts. Yet, these conflicting tones are not a bad thing. While Arc's disconnection from the reality he faces can cause problems, it can also be a source for inspiration. His selfless actions in helping the elven children clearly change Ariane's views on humans enough for her to ask him for his help. And in a more meta sense, it gives the show both some levity to offset its often dark subject matter and provide some good setups for fish-out-of-water humor.    In the most general sense, Arc is an unshakable optimist in a pessimistic world. What's more, his optimism is infectious—spreading to those he befriends. He may not be saving the world in the traditional sense (at least, not yet) but he is saving little pieces of it, making life better for the poor and oppressed he encounters.    Rating:                Random Thoughts   •	So Arc just basically reenacted the final scene of Rogue One on those unarmed bandits. He clearly has zero qualms about killing “bad” people (which has some potentially troubling implications).    •	Ponta was totally down for all that bandit mass murder.    •	I'm unsure whether Arc killed the sadistic noble heir or not. If he did, he's just made a powerful enemy—though Arc looks to be on his way to taking him down anyway just by helping Ariane.    •	While the show clearly doesn't have an insane budget, I like the way they are mixing the CG and 2D animation for the best effect—i.e., 2D for the close ups, CG for the wide shots.    •	More fantasy adventures should have power metal openings. Or better yet, Viking metal openings.    •	I also love how the opening is a mini-adventure and contains both sound effects and voice acting.

Skeleton Knight in Another World Episode 3  by Richard Eisenbeis, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 4.1           Now that we're three episodes in it's safe to say we've established the status quo and here it is: as far as fantasy worlds go, this one objectively sucks to live in. Bandits rape and pillage with near impunity while nobles enslave women and release monsters upon the commoners for their own meager political gains. Rather than a high fantasy world, this one seems much closer to a dark fantasy world—though its clear that Arc is ignorant of this fact. He still sees himself as an RPG protagonist so it makes sense that he runs into conflict everywhere he looks. It doesn't occur to him that the amount of bad stuff he has encountered is the norm for people in this world rather than the exception—which brings us to Ariane.    Ariane is well aware of the nature of her world—and as an elf (specifically a dark elf), she is more privy to its crapsack side than most. While her people are supposedly at peace with the humans, it doesn't stop bandits from kidnapping and enslaving pretty much every elf they come across. As one of the warriors of her kind, it is her job to protect her people—which is something of a loosing battle at this point. It's no surprise that she's jaded and believes all humans are inherently evil liars given her experiences. Arc has got to be the strangest person she has ever met—and not just because of his breadth of powerful magic and skills.    In a world where those with power selfishly abuse it, Arc is the rare individual who uses his for good. What's more is that he does good not for any kind of reward or prestige (aside from the meager funds he needs for room and board) but literally for the joy of doing good. Arc is an adventurer in the truest sense. He simply wants to go on adventures—righting wrongs and helping the downtrodden in the process. His whole life he has played at being this kind of hero in video games but now it's his chance to do it for real.    This is what gives the show its conflicting tones: Horrible stuff is happening constantly in this world yet Arc is still upbeat about the whole thing. The show even acknowledges this through Ariane's reactions to Arc—she is thrown off balance by the way he acts. Yet, these conflicting tones are not a bad thing. While Arc's disconnection from the reality he faces can cause problems, it can also be a source for inspiration. His selfless actions in helping the elven children clearly change Ariane's views on humans enough for her to ask him for his help. And in a more meta sense, it gives the show both some levity to offset its often dark subject matter and provide some good setups for fish-out-of-water humor.    In the most general sense, Arc is an unshakable optimist in a pessimistic world. What's more, his optimism is infectious—spreading to those he befriends. He may not be saving the world in the traditional sense (at least, not yet) but he is saving little pieces of it, making life better for the poor and oppressed he encounters.    Rating:                Random Thoughts   •	So Arc just basically reenacted the final scene of Rogue One on those unarmed bandits. He clearly has zero qualms about killing “bad” people (which has some potentially troubling implications).    •	Ponta was totally down for all that bandit mass murder.    •	I'm unsure whether Arc killed the sadistic noble heir or not. If he did, he's just made a powerful enemy—though Arc looks to be on his way to taking him down anyway just by helping Ariane.    •	While the show clearly doesn't have an insane budget, I like the way they are mixing the CG and 2D animation for the best effect—i.e., 2D for the close ups, CG for the wide shots.    •	More fantasy adventures should have power metal openings. Or better yet, Viking metal openings.    •	I also love how the opening is a mini-adventure and contains both sound effects and voice acting.

27-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/skeleton-knight-in-another-world/episode-3/.184872,Episode 3 - Skeleton Knight in Another World - Anime News Network:SEA,"                How would you rate episode 3 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 4.1           Now that we're three episodes in it's safe to say we've established the status quo and here it is: as far as fantasy worlds go, this one objectively sucks to live in. Bandits rape and pillage with near impunity while nobles enslave women and release monsters upon the commoners for their own meager political gains. Rather than a high fantasy world, this one seems much closer to a dark fantasy world—though its clear that Arc is ignorant of this fact. He still sees himself as an RPG protagonist so it makes sense that he runs into conflict everywhere he looks. It doesn't occur to him that the amount of bad stuff he has encountered is the norm for people in this world rather than the exception—which brings us to Ariane.    Ariane is well aware of the nature of her world—and as an elf (specifically a dark elf), she is more privy to its crapsack side than most. While her people are supposedly at peace with the humans, it doesn't stop bandits from kidnapping and enslaving pretty much every elf they come across. As one of the warriors of her kind, it is her job to protect her people—which is something of a loosing battle at this point. It's no surprise that she's jaded and believes all humans are inherently evil liars given her experiences. Arc has got to be the strangest person she has ever met—and not just because of his breadth of powerful magic and skills.    In a world where those with power selfishly abuse it, Arc is the rare individual who uses his for good. What's more is that he does good not for any kind of reward or prestige (aside from the meager funds he needs for room and board) but literally for the joy of doing good. Arc is an adventurer in the truest sense. He simply wants to go on adventures—righting wrongs and helping the downtrodden in the process. His whole life he has played at being this kind of hero in video games but now it's his chance to do it for real.    This is what gives the show its conflicting tones: Horrible stuff is happening constantly in this world yet Arc is still upbeat about the whole thing. The show even acknowledges this through Ariane's reactions to Arc—she is thrown off balance by the way he acts. Yet, these conflicting tones are not a bad thing. While Arc's disconnection from the reality he faces can cause problems, it can also be a source for inspiration. His selfless actions in helping the elven children clearly change Ariane's views on humans enough for her to ask him for his help. And in a more meta sense, it gives the show both some levity to offset its often dark subject matter and provide some good setups for fish-out-of-water humor.    In the most general sense, Arc is an unshakable optimist in a pessimistic world. What's more, his optimism is infectious—spreading to those he befriends. He may not be saving the world in the traditional sense (at least, not yet) but he is saving little pieces of it, making life better for the poor and oppressed he encounters.    Rating:                Random Thoughts   •	So Arc just basically reenacted the final scene of Rogue One on those unarmed bandits. He clearly has zero qualms about killing “bad” people (which has some potentially troubling implications).    •	Ponta was totally down for all that bandit mass murder.    •	I'm unsure whether Arc killed the sadistic noble heir or not. If he did, he's just made a powerful enemy—though Arc looks to be on his way to taking him down anyway just by helping Ariane.    •	While the show clearly doesn't have an insane budget, I like the way they are mixing the CG and 2D animation for the best effect—i.e., 2D for the close ups, CG for the wide shots.    •	More fantasy adventures should have power metal openings.

Manga on May 3   posted on 2022-04-26 22:15 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra         Full-color digital manga series releases in English    BookWalker Global announced on Tuesday that it will digitally release the first two volumes of Takeya Takekake's I'll Never Send a Selfie Again! (Nidoto Jidori Okutte Yannai!) manga in English on May 3. The company has partnered with Kodansha USA Publishing to exclusively release the full-color manga worldwide.    BookWalker describes the manga:   I'll Never Send a Selfie Again! Himari has never been one to abandon a friend in need, so when her friend Eisuke asks her for a selfie so he can use it as an art reference, how can she refuse? Even if it is...embarrassing... But what's MORE embarrassing is the kind of art he ends up drawing! But he needs her help, and Himari just can't say no, no matter how suggestive the poses get!   Takekake launched the manga on Kodansha's YanMaga Web website in December 2020. Kodansha released the fifth compiled volume of the manga on March 18.

BookWalker describes the manga:   I'll Never Send a Selfie Again! Himari has never been one to abandon a friend in need, so when her friend Eisuke asks her for a selfie so he can use it as an art reference, how can she refuse? Even if it is...embarrassing... But what's MORE embarrassing is the kind of art he ends up drawing! But he needs her help, and Himari just can't say no, no matter how suggestive the poses get!   Takekake launched the manga on Kodansha's YanMaga Web website in December 2020. Kodansha released the fifth compiled volume of the manga on March 18.

Manga on May 3   posted on 2022-04-26 22:15 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra         Full-color digital manga series releases in English    BookWalker Global announced on Tuesday that it will digitally release the first two volumes of Takeya Takekake's I'll Never Send a Selfie Again! (Nidoto Jidori Okutte Yannai!) manga in English on May 3. The company has partnered with Kodansha USA Publishing to exclusively release the full-color manga worldwide.    BookWalker describes the manga:   I'll Never Send a Selfie Again! Himari has never been one to abandon a friend in need, so when her friend Eisuke asks her for a selfie so he can use it as an art reference, how can she refuse? Even if it is...embarrassing... But what's MORE embarrassing is the kind of art he ends up drawing! But he needs her help, and Himari just can't say no, no matter how suggestive the poses get!   Takekake launched the manga on Kodansha's YanMaga Web website in December 2020. Kodansha released the fifth compiled volume of the manga on March 18.

The concept of ""religion without a god"" in a certain country is not really far-fetched though - think Confucianism or other ancient Chinese philosophy schools (Mohism, Legalism). You just put the explanations of all that things as the will of universe itself, without the gods as a medium. spoiler[But it's not the actual case in this story, cause it's not an actual isekai - this world is the remnants of an ancient civilization with advanced technology which is actually a distant future of our world, and the current society is built based on eugenics, artificial population control and ideology cleansing - so it's more like Imperial Cult from Warhammer without technological aspect.]      Back to top                  510    Joined: 27 Feb 2021 		    Posts: 53       Posted: Tue Apr 26, 2022 7:28 am            Is this loli?

The concept of ""religion without a god"" in a certain country is not really far-fetched though - think Confucianism or other ancient Chinese philosophy schools (Mohism, Legalism). You just put the explanations of all that things as the will of universe itself, without the gods as a medium. spoiler[But it's not the actual case in this story, cause it's not an actual isekai - this world is the remnants of an ancient civilization with advanced technology which is actually a distant future of our world, and the current society is built based on eugenics, artificial population control and ideology cleansing - so it's more like Imperial Cult from Warhammer without technological aspect.]      Back to top                  510    Joined: 27 Feb 2021 		    Posts: 53       Posted: Tue Apr 26, 2022 7:28 am            Is this loli?

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episode 30  by Christopher Farris, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 30 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.3            It had been a while since we saw them in Die Neue These, so I suppose it only makes sense that we check back in with the Dominion of Fezzan. There are a couple structural things we can take from this week's episode: 1) That as with the past couple entries, things are still deep in an expositional structure setting up the next major plot beats, and 2) that compared to some of the shuffling that had occurred over the previous episodes of Collision thus far, we are firmly back into the territory of 'near-directly recreating episodes of the old OVA'. Part of that's simply an expected consequence of both versions choosing to adapt the same point of the original story in structurally similar ways. It ultimately just drives home how much of the information imparted in this segment is a fundamental backbone for what other parts are to come, even if what's here isn't exactly the most exciting part of the story.    They do try, a little bit. The directorial designs of this episode love using daylight to frame and style the proceedings as our focal characters, Fezzan's current Landhesherr Adrian Rubinksy and his gopher Kesserling, meet with other leadership in dealings we're assured are most sinister. White light pours into the windows behind Kesserling as he manipulates commissioners from both major factions, and things cool down into the oranges of evening as he reconvenes with Rubinsky towards the end of the episode, communicating the passage of time as well as what an average 'day in the life' all this manipulation has encompassed. As well, the music comes off as a simple but strong asset deployed alongside the cinematography, considerably elevating the presentation of all these conversations compared to the overt exposition we got last week.    So beyond those presentational ambitions reminding us that they originally intended us to watch this thing in a theater, what are we getting, content-wise, out of Die Neue These in this entry? Rubinsky makes a remark late in the episode about setting up pieces in plans that may only turn out to be useful much later down the line. LOGH is no stranger to slow-burn schemes, so the plot here is mostly about seeing some of those setups occur. Well, that and indulging more of Yoshiki Tanaka's analyses on the interconnected machinations of conflict throughout history. Hey, did you know organized religion has had a broad role to play in such things?! They've been hinted at in previous stories, but the beginning of this episode has Rubinsky meeting with a Bishop of the Church of Terra, expositing that Fezzan's long history of prolonging the war between the Alliance and the Empire has been at the behest of this organization's beliefs.    There are obviously…fraught implications for a story as densely analytical as LOGH to suggest that the true masterminds of overarching conflicts are an ancient religion and their integrated financial backing. But for what it's worth – as they have in other variations of the series – the Church of Terra here do come off more like a critique of general organized religion and their holds on society, as opposed to secretive villains operating under the guise of a marginalized group. Hell, Rubinsky himself directly compares the group and its influence to Christianity, specifically, so there's not really any concern for conspiracy theories. Besides, the point Rubinsky arrives at by the end of this little chapter is that such notions of understated, belief-based control of the overall masses is an outdated concept for megalomaniacal masterminding, seeking instead to prove that control via economical capital is the modern path forward. It's an interesting meta-concept baked into the broader thematics of LOGH, and like all the players this one introduces, sets the stage with more elements we'll be able to watch unfold (slowly) as the story goes on.    As for said introduced players...well, they sure are introduced! Some are going to be relevant sooner than others, if this adaptation's structure sticks as close to the old versions as it currently seems to be doing, meaning that Alliance Commissioner Henslow and his planted grudge against Yang will be the one to watch for the near future. Though my personal favorite of those we see Kesserling meeting with is probably Remscheid, whose hairdo proves that even with the glossy redesigns Production I.G is deigning to give to much of this cast, they're still committed to several LOGH characters looking stupid as hell. There's also Schumacher and Landsberg, who exist as a solid example of the series' constant commitment to the idea of the threads of stories never fully being finished, representing ongoing remnants of the nobles' coalition from the Empire's previous civil war. Also I just like the framing of the little darkened-room meeting that Kesserling brings them into, and the way the animation portrays the absolute contempt that Schumacher has to bury as he 'looks forward to working' with Landsberg.    Honestly, the most compelling character introduction is arguably the one who doesn't even live past the end of the episode, courtesy of the series spicing things up with a little vehicular manslaughter, as you do. The investigator known as 'Nidhogg' makes clear that the folks of Fezzan aren't the only ones engaging in manipulation, and needing to make sure he couldn't communicate any of his findings to Oberstein acts as a demonstration of how deep Rubinsky and Kesserling's machinations go. The mere suggestion that a platonic rule between Reinhard's order and Yang's leadership could exist hinges on that economic elite singled out as Rubinsky's driving force in this episode. Early in the LOGH story as we technically still are, it presents a theoretically-tempting concept that even new viewers can guess won't be followed up on for some time. But as with all of its introductions of players to be important later, it continues to deliver – with a stronger presentation this week as well – the kind of conceptual intrigue we keep coming back to this story for.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episode 30  by Christopher Farris, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 30 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.3            It had been a while since we saw them in Die Neue These, so I suppose it only makes sense that we check back in with the Dominion of Fezzan. There are a couple structural things we can take from this week's episode: 1) That as with the past couple entries, things are still deep in an expositional structure setting up the next major plot beats, and 2) that compared to some of the shuffling that had occurred over the previous episodes of Collision thus far, we are firmly back into the territory of 'near-directly recreating episodes of the old OVA'. Part of that's simply an expected consequence of both versions choosing to adapt the same point of the original story in structurally similar ways. It ultimately just drives home how much of the information imparted in this segment is a fundamental backbone for what other parts are to come, even if what's here isn't exactly the most exciting part of the story.    They do try, a little bit. The directorial designs of this episode love using daylight to frame and style the proceedings as our focal characters, Fezzan's current Landhesherr Adrian Rubinksy and his gopher Kesserling, meet with other leadership in dealings we're assured are most sinister. White light pours into the windows behind Kesserling as he manipulates commissioners from both major factions, and things cool down into the oranges of evening as he reconvenes with Rubinsky towards the end of the episode, communicating the passage of time as well as what an average 'day in the life' all this manipulation has encompassed. As well, the music comes off as a simple but strong asset deployed alongside the cinematography, considerably elevating the presentation of all these conversations compared to the overt exposition we got last week.    So beyond those presentational ambitions reminding us that they originally intended us to watch this thing in a theater, what are we getting, content-wise, out of Die Neue These in this entry? Rubinsky makes a remark late in the episode about setting up pieces in plans that may only turn out to be useful much later down the line. LOGH is no stranger to slow-burn schemes, so the plot here is mostly about seeing some of those setups occur. Well, that and indulging more of Yoshiki Tanaka's analyses on the interconnected machinations of conflict throughout history. Hey, did you know organized religion has had a broad role to play in such things?! They've been hinted at in previous stories, but the beginning of this episode has Rubinsky meeting with a Bishop of the Church of Terra, expositing that Fezzan's long history of prolonging the war between the Alliance and the Empire has been at the behest of this organization's beliefs.    There are obviously…fraught implications for a story as densely analytical as LOGH to suggest that the true masterminds of overarching conflicts are an ancient religion and their integrated financial backing. But for what it's worth – as they have in other variations of the series – the Church of Terra here do come off more like a critique of general organized religion and their holds on society, as opposed to secretive villains operating under the guise of a marginalized group. Hell, Rubinsky himself directly compares the group and its influence to Christianity, specifically, so there's not really any concern for conspiracy theories. Besides, the point Rubinsky arrives at by the end of this little chapter is that such notions of understated, belief-based control of the overall masses is an outdated concept for megalomaniacal masterminding, seeking instead to prove that control via economical capital is the modern path forward. It's an interesting meta-concept baked into the broader thematics of LOGH, and like all the players this one introduces, sets the stage with more elements we'll be able to watch unfold (slowly) as the story goes on.    As for said introduced players...well, they sure are introduced! Some are going to be relevant sooner than others, if this adaptation's structure sticks as close to the old versions as it currently seems to be doing, meaning that Alliance Commissioner Henslow and his planted grudge against Yang will be the one to watch for the near future. Though my personal favorite of those we see Kesserling meeting with is probably Remscheid, whose hairdo proves that even with the glossy redesigns Production I.G is deigning to give to much of this cast, they're still committed to several LOGH characters looking stupid as hell. There's also Schumacher and Landsberg, who exist as a solid example of the series' constant commitment to the idea of the threads of stories never fully being finished, representing ongoing remnants of the nobles' coalition from the Empire's previous civil war. Also I just like the framing of the little darkened-room meeting that Kesserling brings them into, and the way the animation portrays the absolute contempt that Schumacher has to bury as he 'looks forward to working' with Landsberg.    Honestly, the most compelling character introduction is arguably the one who doesn't even live past the end of the episode, courtesy of the series spicing things up with a little vehicular manslaughter, as you do. The investigator known as 'Nidhogg' makes clear that the folks of Fezzan aren't the only ones engaging in manipulation, and needing to make sure he couldn't communicate any of his findings to Oberstein acts as a demonstration of how deep Rubinsky and Kesserling's machinations go. The mere suggestion that a platonic rule between Reinhard's order and Yang's leadership could exist hinges on that economic elite singled out as Rubinsky's driving force in this episode. Early in the LOGH story as we technically still are, it presents a theoretically-tempting concept that even new viewers can guess won't be followed up on for some time. But as with all of its introductions of players to be important later, it continues to deliver – with a stronger presentation this week as well – the kind of conceptual intrigue we keep coming back to this story for.

The directorial designs of this episode love using daylight to frame and style the proceedings as our focal characters, Fezzan's current Landhesherr Adrian Rubinksy and his gopher Kesserling, meet with other leadership in dealings we're assured are most sinister. White light pours into the windows behind Kesserling as he manipulates commissioners from both major factions, and things cool down into the oranges of evening as he reconvenes with Rubinsky towards the end of the episode, communicating the passage of time as well as what an average 'day in the life' all this manipulation has encompassed. As well, the music comes off as a simple but strong asset deployed alongside the cinematography, considerably elevating the presentation of all these conversations compared to the overt exposition we got last week.    So beyond those presentational ambitions reminding us that they originally intended us to watch this thing in a theater, what are we getting, content-wise, out of Die Neue These in this entry? Rubinsky makes a remark late in the episode about setting up pieces in plans that may only turn out to be useful much later down the line. LOGH is no stranger to slow-burn schemes, so the plot here is mostly about seeing some of those setups occur. Well, that and indulging more of Yoshiki Tanaka's analyses on the interconnected machinations of conflict throughout history. Hey, did you know organized religion has had a broad role to play in such things?! They've been hinted at in previous stories, but the beginning of this episode has Rubinsky meeting with a Bishop of the Church of Terra, expositing that Fezzan's long history of prolonging the war between the Alliance and the Empire has been at the behest of this organization's beliefs.    There are obviously…fraught implications for a story as densely analytical as LOGH to suggest that the true masterminds of overarching conflicts are an ancient religion and their integrated financial backing. But for what it's worth – as they have in other variations of the series – the Church of Terra here do come off more like a critique of general organized religion and their holds on society, as opposed to secretive villains operating under the guise of a marginalized group. Hell, Rubinsky himself directly compares the group and its influence to Christianity, specifically, so there's not really any concern for conspiracy theories. Besides, the point Rubinsky arrives at by the end of this little chapter is that such notions of understated, belief-based control of the overall masses is an outdated concept for megalomaniacal masterminding, seeking instead to prove that control via economical capital is the modern path forward. It's an interesting meta-concept baked into the broader thematics of LOGH, and like all the players this one introduces, sets the stage with more elements we'll be able to watch unfold (slowly) as the story goes on.    As for said introduced players...well, they sure are introduced! Some are going to be relevant sooner than others, if this adaptation's structure sticks as close to the old versions as it currently seems to be doing, meaning that Alliance Commissioner Henslow and his planted grudge against Yang will be the one to watch for the near future. Though my personal favorite of those we see Kesserling meeting with is probably Remscheid, whose hairdo proves that even with the glossy redesigns Production I.G is deigning to give to much of this cast, they're still committed to several LOGH characters looking stupid as hell. There's also Schumacher and Landsberg, who exist as a solid example of the series' constant commitment to the idea of the threads of stories never fully being finished, representing ongoing remnants of the nobles' coalition from the Empire's previous civil war. Also I just like the framing of the little darkened-room meeting that Kesserling brings them into, and the way the animation portrays the absolute contempt that Schumacher has to bury as he 'looks forward to working' with Landsberg.    Honestly, the most compelling character introduction is arguably the one who doesn't even live past the end of the episode, courtesy of the series spicing things up with a little vehicular manslaughter, as you do. The investigator known as 'Nidhogg' makes clear that the folks of Fezzan aren't the only ones engaging in manipulation, and needing to make sure he couldn't communicate any of his findings to Oberstein acts as a demonstration of how deep Rubinsky and Kesserling's machinations go. The mere suggestion that a platonic rule between Reinhard's order and Yang's leadership could exist hinges on that economic elite singled out as Rubinsky's driving force in this episode. Early in the LOGH story as we technically still are, it presents a theoretically-tempting concept that even new viewers can guess won't be followed up on for some time. But as with all of its introductions of players to be important later, it continues to deliver – with a stronger presentation this week as well – the kind of conceptual intrigue we keep coming back to this story for.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episode 30  by Christopher Farris, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 30 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.3            It had been a while since we saw them in Die Neue These, so I suppose it only makes sense that we check back in with the Dominion of Fezzan. There are a couple structural things we can take from this week's episode: 1) That as with the past couple entries, things are still deep in an expositional structure setting up the next major plot beats, and 2) that compared to some of the shuffling that had occurred over the previous episodes of Collision thus far, we are firmly back into the territory of 'near-directly recreating episodes of the old OVA'. Part of that's simply an expected consequence of both versions choosing to adapt the same point of the original story in structurally similar ways. It ultimately just drives home how much of the information imparted in this segment is a fundamental backbone for what other parts are to come, even if what's here isn't exactly the most exciting part of the story.    They do try, a little bit. The directorial designs of this episode love using daylight to frame and style the proceedings as our focal characters, Fezzan's current Landhesherr Adrian Rubinksy and his gopher Kesserling, meet with other leadership in dealings we're assured are most sinister. White light pours into the windows behind Kesserling as he manipulates commissioners from both major factions, and things cool down into the oranges of evening as he reconvenes with Rubinsky towards the end of the episode, communicating the passage of time as well as what an average 'day in the life' all this manipulation has encompassed.
