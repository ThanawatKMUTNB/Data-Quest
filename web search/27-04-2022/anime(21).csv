But what we get instead is a deeper look into how Izumi and Shikimori's vulnerabilities entangle in interesting ways.                           ep. review          24 comments       Ascendance of a Bookworm Season 3 ‒ Episode 29   Apr 26, 23:30 24 comments                 anime    This is an episode that's very much a simple sequence of setups. It honestly feels less like an episode in its own right and more like the very beginnings of four or five different episodes.                    ep. review          621 comments       One Piece ‒ Episode 1015   Apr 26, 22:30 621 comments                 anime    Every time Megumi Ishitani has the wheel I know we're in for greatness, but my GOD what an episode.

My reception to the series has only grown more positive as each volume expands its world, broadens its cast, and enriches its conceptual landscape. This volume was my favorite by far, and honestly I can't wait to see what's next.

Nijigasaki High School Idol Club Season 2 ‒ Episode 4   Apr 25, 05:30 4 comments                 anime    This is a remarkably somber and emotional setup for a franchise that's most at home with breezy humor and heavy melodrama.

News Donuts Under a Crescent Moon Manga Ends Serialization in May   posted on 2022-04-26 03:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Yuri manga ends on May 18    Creator Shio Usui confirmed on Twitter last week that the Donuts Under a Crescent Moon manga will end in the next issue of Ichijinsha's Comic Yuri Hime magazine on May 18.    The manga's third compiled book volume had revealed last September that the manga would end in its fourth volume.    Seven Seas Entertainment is releasing the manga in English, and it describes the story:   Uno Hinako throws herself into makeup, fashion, and falling in love, hoping that will make her seem “normal” to the other people at her job. But no matter how hard she tries, she's a self-doubting mess inside, and her attempts at “normal” romance with men just keep failing. When she starts to think she might be alone forever, a new normal presents itself–in the form of her relationship with Sato Asahi, a level-headed woman who works at her company, which starts as respect until it becomes far more intimate.   Seven Seas Entertainment released the second volume last August.    Usui launched the Onna Tomodachi to Kekkon Shitemita (Trying Out Marriage to My Female Friend) manga in Cmic Yuri Hime in November 2020. The manga and Donuts Under a Crescent Moon have been running in Comic Yuri Hime simultaneously.

News Donuts Under a Crescent Moon Manga Ends Serialization in May   posted on 2022-04-26 03:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Yuri manga ends on May 18    Creator Shio Usui confirmed on Twitter last week that the Donuts Under a Crescent Moon manga will end in the next issue of Ichijinsha's Comic Yuri Hime magazine on May 18.    The manga's third compiled book volume had revealed last September that the manga would end in its fourth volume.    Seven Seas Entertainment is releasing the manga in English, and it describes the story:   Uno Hinako throws herself into makeup, fashion, and falling in love, hoping that will make her seem “normal” to the other people at her job. But no matter how hard she tries, she's a self-doubting mess inside, and her attempts at “normal” romance with men just keep failing. When she starts to think she might be alone forever, a new normal presents itself–in the form of her relationship with Sato Asahi, a level-headed woman who works at her company, which starts as respect until it becomes far more intimate.   Seven Seas Entertainment released the second volume last August.    Usui launched the Onna Tomodachi to Kekkon Shitemita (Trying Out Marriage to My Female Friend) manga in Cmic Yuri Hime in November 2020. The manga and Donuts Under a Crescent Moon have been running in Comic Yuri Hime simultaneously.

News Donuts Under a Crescent Moon Manga Ends Serialization in May   posted on 2022-04-26 03:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Yuri manga ends on May 18    Creator Shio Usui confirmed on Twitter last week that the Donuts Under a Crescent Moon manga will end in the next issue of Ichijinsha's Comic Yuri Hime magazine on May 18.    The manga's third compiled book volume had revealed last September that the manga would end in its fourth volume.    Seven Seas Entertainment is releasing the manga in English, and it describes the story:   Uno Hinako throws herself into makeup, fashion, and falling in love, hoping that will make her seem “normal” to the other people at her job. But no matter how hard she tries, she's a self-doubting mess inside, and her attempts at “normal” romance with men just keep failing. When she starts to think she might be alone forever, a new normal presents itself–in the form of her relationship with Sato Asahi, a level-headed woman who works at her company, which starts as respect until it becomes far more intimate.   Seven Seas Entertainment released the second volume last August.    Usui launched the Onna Tomodachi to Kekkon Shitemita (Trying Out Marriage to My Female Friend) manga in Cmic Yuri Hime in November 2020. The manga and Donuts Under a Crescent Moon have been running in Comic Yuri Hime simultaneously.

The video announces and previews halca's opening theme song ""Dare-Kare Scramble"" (Everyone, Scramble), and it also announces a new cast member, more staff members, and the July 2 premiere for the anime. The anime is part of Project Engage, and Aniplex announced the project's Engage Kill smartphone game by Square Enix.       Rumi Okubo plays the character Sharon Holygrail:       Tomoya Tanaka (ēlDLIVE assistant director, Visual Prison) is directing the anime at A-1 Pictures. Shunsaku Yano (Try Knights, Record of Grancrest War) is in charge of the world setting. Masaaki Takiyama (Fate/Extra Last Encore, Nyaruko: Crawling with Love!) is serving as both animation character designer and chief animation director. Chiaki Furuzumi (Sword Art Online: Alicization - War of Underworld Part 2, Black Butler: Book of the Atlantic) is also the sub-character designer and chief animation director. Yoshiaki Fujisawa (The Eccentric Family, GATE, Love Live! School idol project, Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation) is composing the music.

Square Enix is producing the Engage Kill smartphone game, which will feature the heroine Chloe Tan. Arisa Kōri voices Chloe:        The anime is set in Baylong City, an artificial island city established, outside of any country's jurisdiction, in the Pacific Ocean to exploit local natural resources. In particular, the mining of the new energy resource orgonium has resulted in an outbreak of ""D disasters"" by demons in the city. Private military companies (PMCs) are tasked with dealing with these incidents.    The protagonist Shū runs a small PMC, though his spending habits have left him constantly penniless. A demon girl named Kisara does contract work at Shū's office and is constantly worried for him. Kisara attends a high school in Baylong City, and does everything from clerical work to household chores with confidence. Meanwhile, Ayano is Shū's ex-girlfriend, an elite agent, and a former work colleague in a major PMC that Shū used to work for.    The anime stars Sōma Saitō as Shu Ogata (right in visual above), Saya Aizawa as Kisara (center), and Lynn as Ayano Yugiri (left).    As previously announced, Fumiaki Maruto, best known for the Saenai Heroine no Sodate-kata light novels and the White Album 2 visual novels, is both writing and supervising the scripts for the anime. Date A Live and Hyperdimension Neptunia illustrator Tsunako is designing the characters.

News Engage Kiss Comedy Anime Unveils More Cast & Staff, July 2 Debut, halca's Opening Song, Square Enix Game App in 1st Video   posted on 2022-04-24 19:01 UTC-8 by Egan Loo          Rumi Okubo joins A-1 Pictures anime's cast; Arisa Kōri stars in smartphone game    The first live-streamed special for A-1 Pictures' ""completely unpredictable romantic comedy"" television anime Engage Kiss  debuted the anime's first full promotional video and first key visual on Sunday. The video announces and previews halca's opening theme song ""Dare-Kare Scramble"" (Everyone, Scramble), and it also announces a new cast member, more staff members, and the July 2 premiere for the anime. The anime is part of Project Engage, and Aniplex announced the project's Engage Kill smartphone game by Square Enix.       Rumi Okubo plays the character Sharon Holygrail:       Tomoya Tanaka (ēlDLIVE assistant director, Visual Prison) is directing the anime at A-1 Pictures. Shunsaku Yano (Try Knights, Record of Grancrest War) is in charge of the world setting. Masaaki Takiyama (Fate/Extra Last Encore, Nyaruko: Crawling with Love!) is serving as both animation character designer and chief animation director. Chiaki Furuzumi (Sword Art Online: Alicization - War of Underworld Part 2, Black Butler: Book of the Atlantic) is also the sub-character designer and chief animation director. Yoshiaki Fujisawa (The Eccentric Family, GATE, Love Live! School idol project, Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation) is composing the music.    The other staff members include:   Original Demon Design: Megumi Katagiri Animation Demon Desgin: Shinpei Wada  Weapons Design: Kenji Teraoka  Action Choreography: Yoshihiro Kanno  Action Director: Hirokatsu Maruyama  Art Director: Nobuhisa Ogiso  Background Art: Kusanagi  Color Key Artist: Nanako Okazaki  Compositing Director of Photography: Yohei Miyawaki  Editing: Kumiko Sakamoto  Sound Director: Takeshi Takadera    The anime wil premiere on the Tokyo MX, Tochigi TV, Gunma TV, BS11, Asahi Broadcasting Corporation TV, and Mētele channels on Saturday, July 2 at 26:30 (effectively, July 3 at 2:30 a.m.) The anime's next live-streamed special will be on June 4.    Square Enix is producing the Engage Kill smartphone game, which will feature the heroine Chloe Tan. Arisa Kōri voices Chloe:        The anime is set in Baylong City, an artificial island city established, outside of any country's jurisdiction, in the Pacific Ocean to exploit local natural resources. In particular, the mining of the new energy resource orgonium has resulted in an outbreak of ""D disasters"" by demons in the city. Private military companies (PMCs) are tasked with dealing with these incidents.    The protagonist Shū runs a small PMC, though his spending habits have left him constantly penniless. A demon girl named Kisara does contract work at Shū's office and is constantly worried for him. Kisara attends a high school in Baylong City, and does everything from clerical work to household chores with confidence. Meanwhile, Ayano is Shū's ex-girlfriend, an elite agent, and a former work colleague in a major PMC that Shū used to work for.    The anime stars Sōma Saitō as Shu Ogata (right in visual above), Saya Aizawa as Kisara (center), and Lynn as Ayano Yugiri (left).    As previously announced, Fumiaki Maruto, best known for the Saenai Heroine no Sodate-kata light novels and the White Album 2 visual novels, is both writing and supervising the scripts for the anime. Date A Live and Hyperdimension Neptunia illustrator Tsunako is designing the characters.

Square Enix is producing the Engage Kill smartphone game, which will feature the heroine Chloe Tan. Arisa Kōri voices Chloe:        The anime is set in Baylong City, an artificial island city established, outside of any country's jurisdiction, in the Pacific Ocean to exploit local natural resources. In particular, the mining of the new energy resource orgonium has resulted in an outbreak of ""D disasters"" by demons in the city. Private military companies (PMCs) are tasked with dealing with these incidents.    The protagonist Shū runs a small PMC, though his spending habits have left him constantly penniless. A demon girl named Kisara does contract work at Shū's office and is constantly worried for him. Kisara attends a high school in Baylong City, and does everything from clerical work to household chores with confidence. Meanwhile, Ayano is Shū's ex-girlfriend, an elite agent, and a former work colleague in a major PMC that Shū used to work for.    The anime stars Sōma Saitō as Shu Ogata (right in visual above), Saya Aizawa as Kisara (center), and Lynn as Ayano Yugiri (left).    As previously announced, Fumiaki Maruto, best known for the Saenai Heroine no Sodate-kata light novels and the White Album 2 visual novels, is both writing and supervising the scripts for the anime. Date A Live and Hyperdimension Neptunia illustrator Tsunako is designing the characters.

That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    review          5 comments       The Lines that Define Me GN 1   Feb 22, 01:00 5 comments                 manga    One young man's foray into classic Japanese art might just be his path to healing. ― Although The Lines that Define Me is about suiboku-ga, or traditional Japanese ink painting, that's really only the vehicle through which the characters express themselves. Aoyama, the protagonist, is clearly not doing well from the moment we meet him setting up for an art exhibit – he's worryingly lightheaded as he ...                    review          10 comments       The Two Lions GN   Feb 21, 01:00 10 comments                 manga    One of Furuya's strengths as a storyteller is the ability to carefully and quietly capture real emotions of the sort that we typically hide inside ourselves; the insecurities that grow unchecked and cause people to misunderstand us. ― The Two Lions is Nagisa Furuya's third English language release – Renta brought over S & N and Kodansha released My Summer of You – and if there's one thing all three t...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for.

Successfully combining the two into a compelling narrative, therefore, isn't necessarily an easy feat.

Sensei's Pious Lie GN 1 We're so used to the narrative that people who experience trauma gain a deeper sense of empathy for others that it's easy to forget that anger, even when it's misplaced, is just as likely.  « »     Review        — Archives —                  Filters          All Southeast Asia  •  Anime Manga Novels Games Music Merch Events Industry People Live-Action COVID-19           Text-only Compact View             Text-only List View             Text-only Grid View             List View with Images             Grid View with Images                               review                Ragna Crimson GN 4   Apr 26, 00:00                 manga    With an anime adaptation in the works, Grant explains why Ragna Crimson gets better with each volume. ― Ragna Crimson continues to find new ways to impress me. My reception to the series has only grown more positive as each volume expands its world, broadens its cast, and enriches its conceptual landscape. This volume was my favorite by far, and honestly I can't wait to see what's next.

Now he's an overweight convenience store owner, married with a young daughter, and he's very happy to keep it that way. Sadly, the crime world isn't all that keen on letting him retire in peace, s...                           review          11 comments       Muteking The Dancing Hero   Apr 24, 00:00 11 comments                 anime    Watch an episode or two of Muteking and it becomes abundantly transparent that there is no subtlety to the clear and direct parallels between the show's story and what is happening in real life. ― If you haven't seen a single episode of Muteking The Dancing Hero, you may think I'm making it up, or that I'm imposing Western values onto the show when I say that it's about how technocrats have gentrifie...                    game review          1 comment       Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness Game Review   Apr 23, 00:00 1 comment                 games    But what about the players who don't have fond memories or excessive fixations surrounding that particular era of video games? What does Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness offer them? As it turns out, plenty. ― There's no shortage of modern creations that evoke the look and sound of late 1980s games. Not so much as those games actually were, but as players fondly remember them—with bigger characters,...                    review          14 comments       The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You GN 1   Apr 22, 00:00 14 comments                 manga    No way he gets 100 girlfriends, right? The thing is, you're thinking about this premise with logic, and logic has no home in this manga. This manga runs off of pure, lovestruck insanity. ― Now I know what you're probably thinking, just from looking at that title. 100? Really? That's obviously some hyperbolic number meant to pull you in, right? There's no way any series could actually introduce a hund...                    review          1 comment       Catch These Hands!

Their rough-and-tumble days of excitement are far in the past but maybe a new kind of excitement is awaiting them? ― An obvious element of the appeal of murata's Catch These Hands is one of contrast—that despite the nominally rough-and-tumble subject matter, the story contained within is actually adorable and sweet as hell. There's little reveren...                    review          4 comments       I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

Shino Shimizu's I'm a Wolf, But My Boss is a Sheep takes a just-similar-enough premise to tell its workplace romantic comedy: in its world, people have animal ...                    review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

They're kind and friendly at heart, but feel like an outcast from others who make fri...                    review          12 comments       The Orbital Children   Apr 18, 00:00 12 comments                 anime    From the creator of Den-noh Coil comes a story about the interconnectivity of humans, artificial intelligence, and our species own mortality. ― Fifteen years ago, the skilled animator Mitsuo Iso helmed Den-Noh Coil, a science fiction tale about children interacting with and exploring the world through augmented reality glasses. It was the first time he was able to show off his incredible storytelling...                    review          7 comments       Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00 7 comments                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week. Now it's back as a (mostly) recap film, which mainly serves to tie up some loo...                    review          8 comments       My Happy Marriage Novel 1   Apr 16, 00:00 8 comments                 novels    Set to become an anime series, check out this variation of the Cinderella story about a down-trodden girl as she embarks on a fantasy romance with a side of ESP. ― Set in an alternate version of the late Meiji or early Taisho era, My Happy Marriage is a fairly classic take on the Cinderella story – especially if you remember that in many, if not most, variants of that tale Cinderella's father is aliv...                    review                Futsal Boys!!!!!

How do these follow-ups to the cherished RPG classic Chrono Trigger endure after all these years? ― The best way to approach Chrono Cross is to forget that it's a sequel to Chrono Trigger.

GN 1   Mar 31, 00:00 2 comments                 manga    The manga starts off with questionable premise (a tenant agrees to exchange sex for roof over her head) but what you'll discover beneath that façade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society. ― It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise.

Atlus describes the story:    Chaos has taken hold of the land in Mask of Truth as a conniving general has unlawfully seized the throne of the mighty Yamato Empire.

News Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth Anime's Video Unveils Cast, 28-Episode Run   posted on 2022-04-26 12:03 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         1st 2 episodes premiere together; Suara performs theme songs; Yuko Gibu reprises Fumirul role    The official website for the television anime of AQUAPLUS' Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth (Utawarerumono: Futari no Hakuoro) game posted the anime's first promotional video and main visual on Tuesday. The video reveals the anime's cast and episode count. The site also unveiled a new visual and the anime's theme song artist.       The anime will have 28 episodes, with the first and second episodes premiering together. The anime premieres in July in Japan. Crunchyroll will stream the anime as it airs in Japan.    Frequent AQUAPLUS theme song singer Suara performs the anime's opening theme song ""Hito Nanda"" (A Man), as well as the ending theme song ""Hyakunichisō"" (Zinnia).     Yuko Gibu joins the anime's cast as the characer Fumirul (rightmost in image above), reprising her role from the game. Also shown above are returning characters (left to right) Yakutowaruto (Takuya Eguchi), Shinonon (Misaki Kuno), and Munechika (Saori Hayami).    Other returning cast members include:     (Left to right in image above): Ai Kakuma as Rurutie, Yumi Hara as Atui, Nozomi Yamamoto as Nosuri, Takahiro Sakurai as Ougi     (Left to right in image above):  Ayane Sakura as Uruuru and Saraana, Ayumu Murase as Kiuru    Previously announced cast members include:     Kentarō Tone (replacing the late Keiji Fujiwara) as Oshtor (Haku)   Risa Taneda as Kuon   Chinatsu Akasaki as Anju   Inori Minase as Nekone    Tone previously played Ukon in Utawarerumono: The False Faces.

AQUAPLUS is composing the music.    Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth is the last game in the Utawarerumono trilogy. Atlus describes the story:    Chaos has taken hold of the land in Mask of Truth as a conniving general has unlawfully seized the throne of the mighty Yamato Empire. The only ones that stand in his way are a couple of familiar faces who must rally different kingdoms together and fight against the powerful Imperial army. An 80+ hours long visual novel/SRPG experience awaits as you'll get close with a new cast of colorful characters, fight in numerous exciting engagements with an enhanced battle system, explore intriguing new lands, and more.   The game launched in North America and Europe on the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in September 2017. The game shipped in Japan for PlayStation 3, PS4, and PS Vita in September 2016.    AQUAPLUS released the original Utawarerumono game in 2002 for the PC. The game inspired a 2006 television anime series and a 2009 original video anime series. ADV Films released the television series in North America in 2007, and Funimation has since picked up the North American release rights.    Utawarerumono: Mask of Deception (Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen), the second game in the series, launched in Japan in September 2015. The game's anime adaptation, Utawarerumono: The False Faces, debuted in October 2015. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Sentai Filmworks released the series on home video.    AQUAPLUS is developing a new game Monochrome Moebius: Toki no Taika to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its Utawarerumono franchise. The game will launch in 2022.

But, the arc was pretty bad with false finishes and pacing. I feel he could cut some of the stuff, to make it flow better. I think he does have the balls for it, however, I think it would be bad if he make his arc longer. (the same thing happen to Horikoshi with MHA)    Good on the editorial department, Tabata ruins the pace by having the final fight of the arc be 14 chapters, all the other fights (before Asta's show up) were greatly pace. The best part about Black Clover was its lightning-fast pacing, when it stops going fast a lot of the flaws begin to show      Back to top                  Connor Dino    Joined: 20 Dec 2010 		    Posts: 174       Posted: Sun Apr 24, 2022 6:46 pm              #rajsaha wrote:       Яeverse wrote:    Hope the final arc is the entire length of the manga           Tabata don't have balls to create a long ass arc and not to make it boring            I am so confused and intrigued by this comment.

But, the arc was pretty bad with false finishes and pacing. I feel he could cut some of the stuff, to make it flow better. I think he does have the balls for it, however, I think it would be bad if he make his arc longer. (the same thing happen to Horikoshi with MHA)    Good on the editorial department, Tabata ruins the pace by having the final fight of the arc be 14 chapters, all the other fights (before Asta's show up) were greatly pace. The best part about Black Clover was its lightning-fast pacing, when it stops going fast a lot of the flaws begin to show      Back to top                  Connor Dino    Joined: 20 Dec 2010 		    Posts: 174       Posted: Sun Apr 24, 2022 6:46 pm              #rajsaha wrote:       Яeverse wrote:    Hope the final arc is the entire length of the manga           Tabata don't have balls to create a long ass arc and not to make it boring            I am so confused and intrigued by this comment.

But, the arc was pretty bad with false finishes and pacing. I feel he could cut some of the stuff, to make it flow better. I think he does have the balls for it, however, I think it would be bad if he make his arc longer. (the same thing happen to Horikoshi with MHA)    Good on the editorial department, Tabata ruins the pace by having the final fight of the arc be 14 chapters, all the other fights (before Asta's show up) were greatly pace. The best part about Black Clover was its lightning-fast pacing, when it stops going fast a lot of the flaws begin to show      Back to top                  Connor Dino    Joined: 20 Dec 2010 		    Posts: 174       Posted: Sun Apr 24, 2022 6:46 pm              #rajsaha wrote:       Яeverse wrote:    Hope the final arc is the entire length of the manga           Tabata don't have balls to create a long ass arc and not to make it boring            I am so confused and intrigued by this comment.

But, the arc was pretty bad with false finishes and pacing. I feel he could cut some of the stuff, to make it flow better. I think he does have the balls for it, however, I think it would be bad if he make his arc longer. (the same thing happen to Horikoshi with MHA)    Good on the editorial department, Tabata ruins the pace by having the final fight of the arc be 14 chapters, all the other fights (before Asta's show up) were greatly pace. The best part about Black Clover was its lightning-fast pacing, when it stops going fast a lot of the flaws begin to show      Back to top                  Connor Dino    Joined: 20 Dec 2010 		    Posts: 174       Posted: Sun Apr 24, 2022 6:46 pm              #rajsaha wrote:       Яeverse wrote:    Hope the final arc is the entire length of the manga           Tabata don't have balls to create a long ass arc and not to make it boring            I am so confused and intrigued by this comment. On one hand...wouldn't it be considered a good thing to not have the ability to make a long, ""boring"" arc? But, considering your phrasing and the common usage of the term ""balls"" it is generally considered a good thing to have them...so I guess it is bad for Tabata doesn't have them? But why would we, the readers want these particular set of balls?   Joking aside, your comment makes no sense.

It didn't invalidate them. Just because there is a perceived explanation doesn't mean they're suddenly excused. The Spade Kingdom Assault was not a good arc.

The whole of spade kingdom was such a drag and I doubt the final arc will be different.  Also, what a bad twist this was.

News Sasaki and Miyano Anime's OVA Previewed in Video   posted on 2022-04-24 11:43 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Anime's ""episode 13"" to ship with manga's 9th volume on July 27    Kadokawa began streaming a ""digest video"" on Friday for the upcoming OVA that will ship on DVD with the ninth volume of Shō Harusono's Sasaki and Miyano manga on July 27. Harusono drafted the original anime episode, titled ""Koi ni Kizuku Mae no Chotto Shita Hanashi."" The episode is considered the 13th episode of the television anime series.      The episode's story begins in November, when a student who lost a keychain goes to Miyano and the others. At Hanzawa's prompting, the ""First Lost-Item Detective Agency"" is established. Hirano's roommate Akira Kagiura appears in the episode, and Nobunaga Shimazaki reprises this role from an earlier drama CD.    The television anime premiered on January 9 and aired for 12 episodes. Funimation streamed the anime as it aired and also streamed an English dub.    The staff of the anime announced in March that there would be a new anime in the franchise. The announcement was made after the original announcement for the OVA, which was announced in December.    Shinji Ishihira (Fairy Tail, Log Horizon, Talentless Nana) directed the television anime at Studio DEEN with Takahiro Ueno as the assistant director. Yoshiko Nakamura (Super Lovers, Shōnen Maid, Tada Never Falls in Love) was in charge of series scripts. Maki Fujii (I've Always Liked You, The Moment You Fall in Love, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart.) designed the characters.    Yen Press licensed the manga, and it describes the story:    It all started like a typical old-school boys' love plotline—bad-boy senior meets adorably awkward underclassman, one of them falls in love, and so on and so forth. But although Miyano is a self-proclaimed boys' love expert, he hasn't quite realized…he's in one himself. Which means it's up to Sasaki to make sure their story has a happily ever after…!   Harusono launched the manga on the pixiv website in 2016.

News Sasaki and Miyano Anime's OVA Previewed in Video   posted on 2022-04-24 11:43 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Anime's ""episode 13"" to ship with manga's 9th volume on July 27    Kadokawa began streaming a ""digest video"" on Friday for the upcoming OVA that will ship on DVD with the ninth volume of Shō Harusono's Sasaki and Miyano manga on July 27. Harusono drafted the original anime episode, titled ""Koi ni Kizuku Mae no Chotto Shita Hanashi."" The episode is considered the 13th episode of the television anime series.      The episode's story begins in November, when a student who lost a keychain goes to Miyano and the others. At Hanzawa's prompting, the ""First Lost-Item Detective Agency"" is established. Hirano's roommate Akira Kagiura appears in the episode, and Nobunaga Shimazaki reprises this role from an earlier drama CD.    The television anime premiered on January 9 and aired for 12 episodes. Funimation streamed the anime as it aired and also streamed an English dub.    The staff of the anime announced in March that there would be a new anime in the franchise. The announcement was made after the original announcement for the OVA, which was announced in December.    Shinji Ishihira (Fairy Tail, Log Horizon, Talentless Nana) directed the television anime at Studio DEEN with Takahiro Ueno as the assistant director. Yoshiko Nakamura (Super Lovers, Shōnen Maid, Tada Never Falls in Love) was in charge of series scripts. Maki Fujii (I've Always Liked You, The Moment You Fall in Love, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart.) designed the characters.    Yen Press licensed the manga, and it describes the story:    It all started like a typical old-school boys' love plotline—bad-boy senior meets adorably awkward underclassman, one of them falls in love, and so on and so forth. But although Miyano is a self-proclaimed boys' love expert, he hasn't quite realized…he's in one himself. Which means it's up to Sasaki to make sure their story has a happily ever after…!   Harusono launched the manga on the pixiv website in 2016.

News Sasaki and Miyano Anime's OVA Previewed in Video   posted on 2022-04-24 11:43 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Anime's ""episode 13"" to ship with manga's 9th volume on July 27    Kadokawa began streaming a ""digest video"" on Friday for the upcoming OVA that will ship on DVD with the ninth volume of Shō Harusono's Sasaki and Miyano manga on July 27. Harusono drafted the original anime episode, titled ""Koi ni Kizuku Mae no Chotto Shita Hanashi."" The episode is considered the 13th episode of the television anime series.      The episode's story begins in November, when a student who lost a keychain goes to Miyano and the others. At Hanzawa's prompting, the ""First Lost-Item Detective Agency"" is established. Hirano's roommate Akira Kagiura appears in the episode, and Nobunaga Shimazaki reprises this role from an earlier drama CD.    The television anime premiered on January 9 and aired for 12 episodes. Funimation streamed the anime as it aired and also streamed an English dub.    The staff of the anime announced in March that there would be a new anime in the franchise. The announcement was made after the original announcement for the OVA, which was announced in December.    Shinji Ishihira (Fairy Tail, Log Horizon, Talentless Nana) directed the television anime at Studio DEEN with Takahiro Ueno as the assistant director. Yoshiko Nakamura (Super Lovers, Shōnen Maid, Tada Never Falls in Love) was in charge of series scripts. Maki Fujii (I've Always Liked You, The Moment You Fall in Love, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart.) designed the characters.    Yen Press licensed the manga, and it describes the story:    It all started like a typical old-school boys' love plotline—bad-boy senior meets adorably awkward underclassman, one of them falls in love, and so on and so forth. But although Miyano is a self-proclaimed boys' love expert, he hasn't quite realized…he's in one himself. Which means it's up to Sasaki to make sure their story has a happily ever after…!   Harusono launched the manga on the pixiv website in 2016.

Heidi breaks down what to expect. ― Greetings, everyone! I am quite relieved today, as it was very likely TWIG might not have happened this week. I got the letter in the mail that most every adult dreads: a jury duty summons, set for the exact day I write and submit TWIG. Thankfully, I wasn't needed, which frees me up to both ...                    column          14 comments       This Week in Games - What A Twist   Jan 22, 03:00 14 comments                 games    Good lord.

Just a heads-up: This Week in Games is probably going to be a Friday thing from now on. This benefits me because game companies, for whatever reason, just love dumping news on Thursdays, leaving me to either delay the column or look horribly out of date. Hopefully Friday publication solves this issue somewhat. As much ...                    column          17 comments       This Week in Games - Yes Ma'am   2021 Jan 26, 05:02 17 comments                 games    Resident Evil Village reignited Heidi (and everyone's) desire to be stepped on by an intimidating woman. ― Hi folks!

My man Keanu deserved better. ― Ho ho ho, Merry TWIGmas everyone! A little late, I know, but we're still in the holiday spirit.

And it's very obvious what game this announcement is related to if you've played it. ― Hey hey! It's the middle of November, and that means… uh, nothing!
