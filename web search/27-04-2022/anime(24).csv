Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Episodes 9-12  by James Beckett, Apr 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 9 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?

Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 12 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 3.9              I don't think there was ever really a chance that Magia Record was going to outdo, or even fully live up to, the impossibly gargantuan reputation of Puella Magi Madoka Magica. That said, while the first two seasons of Magia Record were wildly uneven and overstuffed, the show was always this close to successfully making a case for its own existence. The universe of PMMM was always big, but its core story was a very personal one, and Magia Record offered us a welcome glimpse of the larger world of Magical Girls and Witches that Madoka and Co. always existed in, but rarely got to explore.  Sure, the plot relied way too much on dragged-out mysteries and featured a cast of characters multiple times larger than the original series', but there was always a lot of promise to the story of Iroha, Ui, and the Wings of Magius, even if that promise capped out at being “pretty decently okay” compared to its legendary older sibling. The real question going into this final “season” of Magia Record, titled “Dawn of a Shallow Dream”, was whether or not the series could live up to that potential at last. What is perhaps the most striking about “Dawn of a Fragile Dream”, then, is how successfully it is able to provide a conclusion to this series that genuinely works in the span of only four episodes.   “We Failed”, for instance, is one of those story-critical lore dumps that somehow manages to deliver answers to questions that we've been asking for years without disappointing entirely. Sure, the tragic backstory of Ui, Touka, and Nemu isn't especially surprising or shocking, but the arc of their fall from grace is very satisfying, and it successfully puts the previous two seasons into a more meaningful perspective. You understand why the trio would be willing to take on the burden of being Magical Girls to save Iroha and the others from their fates to become witches, and it's honestly awesome to see them not only figure out the truth of Kyubey's trick so quickly, but to come up with a solution that actually sounds like it might succeed, even though we all know that it can't.    It's too bad that the girls are characters in a Madoka Magica spinoff. Like so many other heroines of this franchise, Ui and her friends merely wanted to use the power of the Magical Girl to do good and protect the people they love, and all they got for it was the honor of dooming everybody to a different manner of existential hell. None of that is new or fresh for this franchise, but it sure does feel right. Plus, I'm just happy that ultimate explanation of Baby Kyubey is that it was last remnant of Ui's soul left from the girls' failed attempt to harness Kyubey's powers. I was so sure that the Baby Kyubey gimmick would end up being stupid and/or disappointing, and I ended up being pleasantly surprised.  With most of the lingering lore questions resolved, the remaining trio of episodes have the unenviable job of bringing the present day plot to a close, and you know what? I think they get the job done. It's not perfect, by any means; there was no way that every single girl was going to get the opportunity to have a neatly concluded character arc or emotional journey, but Magia Record makes its final hour count by eschewing the individual characters' stories in favor of giving its thematic concerns the attention they deserve (not to mention a bunch of gorgeously animated magical girl battles, naturally). Outside of Iroha, the Hospital Gang, and Kuroe, there is neither the time nor the space for the other girls to get more than one or two big moments, but in the cacophony of the final battle, those moments feel a lot more meaningful than they really should.   The sacrifice of Mifuyu and Momoko; the Doppel-fication of dozens of other girls; the grand spectacle of the final battle. None of these beats have had the buildup that they each deserve, but the supremely confident direction of Gekidan Inu Curry means that these episodes are still supremely engaging on an individual level in spite of the larger pacing problems that have plagued Magia Record on a big-picture level since Season 1. In these final episodes, Magia Record devotes itself entirely to serving as a meditation on the core ideas and emotions that swirl around in the bloody, beating heart of the franchise, and in that sense, Magia Record functions less as a fully-fledged companion piece to Madoka Magica and more like a bizarre piece of tone-poem fan-fiction. This is a complement, by the way.  It's why I can have a genuine emotional reaction to Kuroe's fall to despair in “How Long Do We Continue Being Magical Girls”, even though the character only just barely began making an impression in the back half of Season 2. It's why I can accept Alina's presence as the more straightforwardly destructive “villain” of the story, even though she barely exists as a character. It's why I can accept that this tonally confused adaptation of a failed mobile game decides to end in such an unrelentingly bleak fashion, where our heroes desperately fight for the opportunity to fail at everything they set out to do. Sure, Alina didn't turn literally every human on earth into a doomed Magical Girl, but the Magical Girls that already exist are still doomed. When Homura blips off to a new timeline in the ending montage, it might as well be her admission that this entire universe is a lost cause. The three “sisters” that Iroha fought so hard to protect are gone, the survivors of the Magius conflict are left with little more than a broken city and a million pieces to pick up, and absolutely nobody else in the world will ever even know what they suffered for. What they will suffer for.  Well, almost nobody. Madoka Magica is fundamentally a story about hope, and in that final shot of the celestial Madoka taking the Magia Record in her arms, we're reminded that it wasn't for nothing, not really. Every single moment that Iroha and the others spent fighting was worthwhile, because they matter. If there's any moral to take from this story, it's that every single Magical Girl matters, no matter how cliché or rushed or inconsistent their stories might be. There might be one particular girl who gets to have her name on the marquee, but there are hundreds of others just like her, fighting and failing and trying again, all of the time, even when they know that the best case scenario is only one or two degrees removed from complete despair.  So, in the end, Magia Record was sometimes just as disappointing and unfulfilling as we all feared it would be, and it was sometimes a beautiful little thing in spite of itself. It stumbled many times in its attempts to justify itself as a successor to one of the most popular and influential anime ever made, and while I would never argue that it surpasses Madoka Magica, I can tell you now that I am glad that Magia Record exists. It made its case, and it told its story. These girls can rest, for now, and maybe dream of something better that could be waiting for them, in another life. They've done enough.

Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Episodes 9-12  by James Beckett, Apr 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 9 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?

Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 12 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 3.9              I don't think there was ever really a chance that Magia Record was going to outdo, or even fully live up to, the impossibly gargantuan reputation of Puella Magi Madoka Magica. That said, while the first two seasons of Magia Record were wildly uneven and overstuffed, the show was always this close to successfully making a case for its own existence. The universe of PMMM was always big, but its core story was a very personal one, and Magia Record offered us a welcome glimpse of the larger world of Magical Girls and Witches that Madoka and Co. always existed in, but rarely got to explore.  Sure, the plot relied way too much on dragged-out mysteries and featured a cast of characters multiple times larger than the original series', but there was always a lot of promise to the story of Iroha, Ui, and the Wings of Magius, even if that promise capped out at being “pretty decently okay” compared to its legendary older sibling. The real question going into this final “season” of Magia Record, titled “Dawn of a Shallow Dream”, was whether or not the series could live up to that potential at last. What is perhaps the most striking about “Dawn of a Fragile Dream”, then, is how successfully it is able to provide a conclusion to this series that genuinely works in the span of only four episodes.   “We Failed”, for instance, is one of those story-critical lore dumps that somehow manages to deliver answers to questions that we've been asking for years without disappointing entirely. Sure, the tragic backstory of Ui, Touka, and Nemu isn't especially surprising or shocking, but the arc of their fall from grace is very satisfying, and it successfully puts the previous two seasons into a more meaningful perspective. You understand why the trio would be willing to take on the burden of being Magical Girls to save Iroha and the others from their fates to become witches, and it's honestly awesome to see them not only figure out the truth of Kyubey's trick so quickly, but to come up with a solution that actually sounds like it might succeed, even though we all know that it can't.    It's too bad that the girls are characters in a Madoka Magica spinoff. Like so many other heroines of this franchise, Ui and her friends merely wanted to use the power of the Magical Girl to do good and protect the people they love, and all they got for it was the honor of dooming everybody to a different manner of existential hell. None of that is new or fresh for this franchise, but it sure does feel right. Plus, I'm just happy that ultimate explanation of Baby Kyubey is that it was last remnant of Ui's soul left from the girls' failed attempt to harness Kyubey's powers. I was so sure that the Baby Kyubey gimmick would end up being stupid and/or disappointing, and I ended up being pleasantly surprised.  With most of the lingering lore questions resolved, the remaining trio of episodes have the unenviable job of bringing the present day plot to a close, and you know what? I think they get the job done. It's not perfect, by any means; there was no way that every single girl was going to get the opportunity to have a neatly concluded character arc or emotional journey, but Magia Record makes its final hour count by eschewing the individual characters' stories in favor of giving its thematic concerns the attention they deserve (not to mention a bunch of gorgeously animated magical girl battles, naturally). Outside of Iroha, the Hospital Gang, and Kuroe, there is neither the time nor the space for the other girls to get more than one or two big moments, but in the cacophony of the final battle, those moments feel a lot more meaningful than they really should.   The sacrifice of Mifuyu and Momoko; the Doppel-fication of dozens of other girls; the grand spectacle of the final battle. None of these beats have had the buildup that they each deserve, but the supremely confident direction of Gekidan Inu Curry means that these episodes are still supremely engaging on an individual level in spite of the larger pacing problems that have plagued Magia Record on a big-picture level since Season 1. In these final episodes, Magia Record devotes itself entirely to serving as a meditation on the core ideas and emotions that swirl around in the bloody, beating heart of the franchise, and in that sense, Magia Record functions less as a fully-fledged companion piece to Madoka Magica and more like a bizarre piece of tone-poem fan-fiction. This is a complement, by the way.  It's why I can have a genuine emotional reaction to Kuroe's fall to despair in “How Long Do We Continue Being Magical Girls”, even though the character only just barely began making an impression in the back half of Season 2. It's why I can accept Alina's presence as the more straightforwardly destructive “villain” of the story, even though she barely exists as a character. It's why I can accept that this tonally confused adaptation of a failed mobile game decides to end in such an unrelentingly bleak fashion, where our heroes desperately fight for the opportunity to fail at everything they set out to do. Sure, Alina didn't turn literally every human on earth into a doomed Magical Girl, but the Magical Girls that already exist are still doomed. When Homura blips off to a new timeline in the ending montage, it might as well be her admission that this entire universe is a lost cause. The three “sisters” that Iroha fought so hard to protect are gone, the survivors of the Magius conflict are left with little more than a broken city and a million pieces to pick up, and absolutely nobody else in the world will ever even know what they suffered for. What they will suffer for.  Well, almost nobody. Madoka Magica is fundamentally a story about hope, and in that final shot of the celestial Madoka taking the Magia Record in her arms, we're reminded that it wasn't for nothing, not really. Every single moment that Iroha and the others spent fighting was worthwhile, because they matter. If there's any moral to take from this story, it's that every single Magical Girl matters, no matter how cliché or rushed or inconsistent their stories might be. There might be one particular girl who gets to have her name on the marquee, but there are hundreds of others just like her, fighting and failing and trying again, all of the time, even when they know that the best case scenario is only one or two degrees removed from complete despair.  So, in the end, Magia Record was sometimes just as disappointing and unfulfilling as we all feared it would be, and it was sometimes a beautiful little thing in spite of itself. It stumbled many times in its attempts to justify itself as a successor to one of the most popular and influential anime ever made, and while I would never argue that it surpasses Madoka Magica, I can tell you now that I am glad that Magia Record exists. It made its case, and it told its story. These girls can rest, for now, and maybe dream of something better that could be waiting for them, in another life. They've done enough.

Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Episodes 9-12  by James Beckett, Apr 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 9 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 10 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 11 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 12 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 3.9              I don't think there was ever really a chance that Magia Record was going to outdo, or even fully live up to, the impossibly gargantuan reputation of Puella Magi Madoka Magica. That said, while the first two seasons of Magia Record were wildly uneven and overstuffed, the show was always this close to successfully making a case for its own existence. The universe of PMMM was always big, but its core story was a very personal one, and Magia Record offered us a welcome glimpse of the larger world of Magical Girls and Witches that Madoka and Co. always existed in, but rarely got to explore.  Sure, the plot relied way too much on dragged-out mysteries and featured a cast of characters multiple times larger than the original series', but there was always a lot of promise to the story of Iroha, Ui, and the Wings of Magius, even if that promise capped out at being “pretty decently okay” compared to its legendary older sibling. The real question going into this final “season” of Magia Record, titled “Dawn of a Shallow Dream”, was whether or not the series could live up to that potential at last. What is perhaps the most striking about “Dawn of a Fragile Dream”, then, is how successfully it is able to provide a conclusion to this series that genuinely works in the span of only four episodes.   “We Failed”, for instance, is one of those story-critical lore dumps that somehow manages to deliver answers to questions that we've been asking for years without disappointing entirely. Sure, the tragic backstory of Ui, Touka, and Nemu isn't especially surprising or shocking, but the arc of their fall from grace is very satisfying, and it successfully puts the previous two seasons into a more meaningful perspective. You understand why the trio would be willing to take on the burden of being Magical Girls to save Iroha and the others from their fates to become witches, and it's honestly awesome to see them not only figure out the truth of Kyubey's trick so quickly, but to come up with a solution that actually sounds like it might succeed, even though we all know that it can't.    It's too bad that the girls are characters in a Madoka Magica spinoff. Like so many other heroines of this franchise, Ui and her friends merely wanted to use the power of the Magical Girl to do good and protect the people they love, and all they got for it was the honor of dooming everybody to a different manner of existential hell. None of that is new or fresh for this franchise, but it sure does feel right. Plus, I'm just happy that ultimate explanation of Baby Kyubey is that it was last remnant of Ui's soul left from the girls' failed attempt to harness Kyubey's powers. I was so sure that the Baby Kyubey gimmick would end up being stupid and/or disappointing, and I ended up being pleasantly surprised.  With most of the lingering lore questions resolved, the remaining trio of episodes have the unenviable job of bringing the present day plot to a close, and you know what? I think they get the job done. It's not perfect, by any means; there was no way that every single girl was going to get the opportunity to have a neatly concluded character arc or emotional journey, but Magia Record makes its final hour count by eschewing the individual characters' stories in favor of giving its thematic concerns the attention they deserve (not to mention a bunch of gorgeously animated magical girl battles, naturally). Outside of Iroha, the Hospital Gang, and Kuroe, there is neither the time nor the space for the other girls to get more than one or two big moments, but in the cacophony of the final battle, those moments feel a lot more meaningful than they really should.   The sacrifice of Mifuyu and Momoko; the Doppel-fication of dozens of other girls; the grand spectacle of the final battle. None of these beats have had the buildup that they each deserve, but the supremely confident direction of Gekidan Inu Curry means that these episodes are still supremely engaging on an individual level in spite of the larger pacing problems that have plagued Magia Record on a big-picture level since Season 1. In these final episodes, Magia Record devotes itself entirely to serving as a meditation on the core ideas and emotions that swirl around in the bloody, beating heart of the franchise, and in that sense, Magia Record functions less as a fully-fledged companion piece to Madoka Magica and more like a bizarre piece of tone-poem fan-fiction. This is a complement, by the way.  It's why I can have a genuine emotional reaction to Kuroe's fall to despair in “How Long Do We Continue Being Magical Girls”, even though the character only just barely began making an impression in the back half of Season 2. It's why I can accept Alina's presence as the more straightforwardly destructive “villain” of the story, even though she barely exists as a character. It's why I can accept that this tonally confused adaptation of a failed mobile game decides to end in such an unrelentingly bleak fashion, where our heroes desperately fight for the opportunity to fail at everything they set out to do. Sure, Alina didn't turn literally every human on earth into a doomed Magical Girl, but the Magical Girls that already exist are still doomed. When Homura blips off to a new timeline in the ending montage, it might as well be her admission that this entire universe is a lost cause. The three “sisters” that Iroha fought so hard to protect are gone, the survivors of the Magius conflict are left with little more than a broken city and a million pieces to pick up, and absolutely nobody else in the world will ever even know what they suffered for. What they will suffer for.  Well, almost nobody. Madoka Magica is fundamentally a story about hope, and in that final shot of the celestial Madoka taking the Magia Record in her arms, we're reminded that it wasn't for nothing, not really. Every single moment that Iroha and the others spent fighting was worthwhile, because they matter. If there's any moral to take from this story, it's that every single Magical Girl matters, no matter how cliché or rushed or inconsistent their stories might be. There might be one particular girl who gets to have her name on the marquee, but there are hundreds of others just like her, fighting and failing and trying again, all of the time, even when they know that the best case scenario is only one or two degrees removed from complete despair.  So, in the end, Magia Record was sometimes just as disappointing and unfulfilling as we all feared it would be, and it was sometimes a beautiful little thing in spite of itself. It stumbled many times in its attempts to justify itself as a successor to one of the most popular and influential anime ever made, and while I would never argue that it surpasses Madoka Magica, I can tell you now that I am glad that Magia Record exists. It made its case, and it told its story. These girls can rest, for now, and maybe dream of something better that could be waiting for them, in another life. They've done enough.

With most of the lingering lore questions resolved, the remaining trio of episodes have the unenviable job of bringing the present day plot to a close, and you know what? I think they get the job done. It's not perfect, by any means; there was no way that every single girl was going to get the opportunity to have a neatly concluded character arc or emotional journey, but Magia Record makes its final hour count by eschewing the individual characters' stories in favor of giving its thematic concerns the attention they deserve (not to mention a bunch of gorgeously animated magical girl battles, naturally). Outside of Iroha, the Hospital Gang, and Kuroe, there is neither the time nor the space for the other girls to get more than one or two big moments, but in the cacophony of the final battle, those moments feel a lot more meaningful than they really should.   The sacrifice of Mifuyu and Momoko; the Doppel-fication of dozens of other girls; the grand spectacle of the final battle. None of these beats have had the buildup that they each deserve, but the supremely confident direction of Gekidan Inu Curry means that these episodes are still supremely engaging on an individual level in spite of the larger pacing problems that have plagued Magia Record on a big-picture level since Season 1. In these final episodes, Magia Record devotes itself entirely to serving as a meditation on the core ideas and emotions that swirl around in the bloody, beating heart of the franchise, and in that sense, Magia Record functions less as a fully-fledged companion piece to Madoka Magica and more like a bizarre piece of tone-poem fan-fiction. This is a complement, by the way.  It's why I can have a genuine emotional reaction to Kuroe's fall to despair in “How Long Do We Continue Being Magical Girls”, even though the character only just barely began making an impression in the back half of Season 2.

Sure, Alina didn't turn literally every human on earth into a doomed Magical Girl, but the Magical Girls that already exist are still doomed. When Homura blips off to a new timeline in the ending montage, it might as well be her admission that this entire universe is a lost cause. The three “sisters” that Iroha fought so hard to protect are gone, the survivors of the Magius conflict are left with little more than a broken city and a million pieces to pick up, and absolutely nobody else in the world will ever even know what they suffered for.

Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Episodes 9-12  by James Beckett, Apr 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 9 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?

Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 12 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 3.9              I don't think there was ever really a chance that Magia Record was going to outdo, or even fully live up to, the impossibly gargantuan reputation of Puella Magi Madoka Magica. That said, while the first two seasons of Magia Record were wildly uneven and overstuffed, the show was always this close to successfully making a case for its own existence. The universe of PMMM was always big, but its core story was a very personal one, and Magia Record offered us a welcome glimpse of the larger world of Magical Girls and Witches that Madoka and Co. always existed in, but rarely got to explore.  Sure, the plot relied way too much on dragged-out mysteries and featured a cast of characters multiple times larger than the original series', but there was always a lot of promise to the story of Iroha, Ui, and the Wings of Magius, even if that promise capped out at being “pretty decently okay” compared to its legendary older sibling. The real question going into this final “season” of Magia Record, titled “Dawn of a Shallow Dream”, was whether or not the series could live up to that potential at last. What is perhaps the most striking about “Dawn of a Fragile Dream”, then, is how successfully it is able to provide a conclusion to this series that genuinely works in the span of only four episodes.   “We Failed”, for instance, is one of those story-critical lore dumps that somehow manages to deliver answers to questions that we've been asking for years without disappointing entirely. Sure, the tragic backstory of Ui, Touka, and Nemu isn't especially surprising or shocking, but the arc of their fall from grace is very satisfying, and it successfully puts the previous two seasons into a more meaningful perspective. You understand why the trio would be willing to take on the burden of being Magical Girls to save Iroha and the others from their fates to become witches, and it's honestly awesome to see them not only figure out the truth of Kyubey's trick so quickly, but to come up with a solution that actually sounds like it might succeed, even though we all know that it can't.    It's too bad that the girls are characters in a Madoka Magica spinoff. Like so many other heroines of this franchise, Ui and her friends merely wanted to use the power of the Magical Girl to do good and protect the people they love, and all they got for it was the honor of dooming everybody to a different manner of existential hell. None of that is new or fresh for this franchise, but it sure does feel right. Plus, I'm just happy that ultimate explanation of Baby Kyubey is that it was last remnant of Ui's soul left from the girls' failed attempt to harness Kyubey's powers. I was so sure that the Baby Kyubey gimmick would end up being stupid and/or disappointing, and I ended up being pleasantly surprised.  With most of the lingering lore questions resolved, the remaining trio of episodes have the unenviable job of bringing the present day plot to a close, and you know what? I think they get the job done. It's not perfect, by any means; there was no way that every single girl was going to get the opportunity to have a neatly concluded character arc or emotional journey, but Magia Record makes its final hour count by eschewing the individual characters' stories in favor of giving its thematic concerns the attention they deserve (not to mention a bunch of gorgeously animated magical girl battles, naturally). Outside of Iroha, the Hospital Gang, and Kuroe, there is neither the time nor the space for the other girls to get more than one or two big moments, but in the cacophony of the final battle, those moments feel a lot more meaningful than they really should.   The sacrifice of Mifuyu and Momoko; the Doppel-fication of dozens of other girls; the grand spectacle of the final battle. None of these beats have had the buildup that they each deserve, but the supremely confident direction of Gekidan Inu Curry means that these episodes are still supremely engaging on an individual level in spite of the larger pacing problems that have plagued Magia Record on a big-picture level since Season 1. In these final episodes, Magia Record devotes itself entirely to serving as a meditation on the core ideas and emotions that swirl around in the bloody, beating heart of the franchise, and in that sense, Magia Record functions less as a fully-fledged companion piece to Madoka Magica and more like a bizarre piece of tone-poem fan-fiction. This is a complement, by the way.  It's why I can have a genuine emotional reaction to Kuroe's fall to despair in “How Long Do We Continue Being Magical Girls”, even though the character only just barely began making an impression in the back half of Season 2. It's why I can accept Alina's presence as the more straightforwardly destructive “villain” of the story, even though she barely exists as a character. It's why I can accept that this tonally confused adaptation of a failed mobile game decides to end in such an unrelentingly bleak fashion, where our heroes desperately fight for the opportunity to fail at everything they set out to do. Sure, Alina didn't turn literally every human on earth into a doomed Magical Girl, but the Magical Girls that already exist are still doomed. When Homura blips off to a new timeline in the ending montage, it might as well be her admission that this entire universe is a lost cause. The three “sisters” that Iroha fought so hard to protect are gone, the survivors of the Magius conflict are left with little more than a broken city and a million pieces to pick up, and absolutely nobody else in the world will ever even know what they suffered for. What they will suffer for.  Well, almost nobody. Madoka Magica is fundamentally a story about hope, and in that final shot of the celestial Madoka taking the Magia Record in her arms, we're reminded that it wasn't for nothing, not really. Every single moment that Iroha and the others spent fighting was worthwhile, because they matter. If there's any moral to take from this story, it's that every single Magical Girl matters, no matter how cliché or rushed or inconsistent their stories might be. There might be one particular girl who gets to have her name on the marquee, but there are hundreds of others just like her, fighting and failing and trying again, all of the time, even when they know that the best case scenario is only one or two degrees removed from complete despair.  So, in the end, Magia Record was sometimes just as disappointing and unfulfilling as we all feared it would be, and it was sometimes a beautiful little thing in spite of itself. It stumbled many times in its attempts to justify itself as a successor to one of the most popular and influential anime ever made, and while I would never argue that it surpasses Madoka Magica, I can tell you now that I am glad that Magia Record exists. It made its case, and it told its story. These girls can rest, for now, and maybe dream of something better that could be waiting for them, in another life. They've done enough.

You understand why the trio would be willing to take on the burden of being Magical Girls to save Iroha and the others from their fates to become witches, and it's honestly awesome to see them not only figure out the truth of Kyubey's trick so quickly, but to come up with a solution that actually sounds like it might succeed, even though we all know that it can't.    It's too bad that the girls are characters in a Madoka Magica spinoff. Like so many other heroines of this franchise, Ui and her friends merely wanted to use the power of the Magical Girl to do good and protect the people they love, and all they got for it was the honor of dooming everybody to a different manner of existential hell. None of that is new or fresh for this franchise, but it sure does feel right. Plus, I'm just happy that ultimate explanation of Baby Kyubey is that it was last remnant of Ui's soul left from the girls' failed attempt to harness Kyubey's powers. I was so sure that the Baby Kyubey gimmick would end up being stupid and/or disappointing, and I ended up being pleasantly surprised.  With most of the lingering lore questions resolved, the remaining trio of episodes have the unenviable job of bringing the present day plot to a close, and you know what? I think they get the job done. It's not perfect, by any means; there was no way that every single girl was going to get the opportunity to have a neatly concluded character arc or emotional journey, but Magia Record makes its final hour count by eschewing the individual characters' stories in favor of giving its thematic concerns the attention they deserve (not to mention a bunch of gorgeously animated magical girl battles, naturally). Outside of Iroha, the Hospital Gang, and Kuroe, there is neither the time nor the space for the other girls to get more than one or two big moments, but in the cacophony of the final battle, those moments feel a lot more meaningful than they really should.   The sacrifice of Mifuyu and Momoko; the Doppel-fication of dozens of other girls; the grand spectacle of the final battle. None of these beats have had the buildup that they each deserve, but the supremely confident direction of Gekidan Inu Curry means that these episodes are still supremely engaging on an individual level in spite of the larger pacing problems that have plagued Magia Record on a big-picture level since Season 1. In these final episodes, Magia Record devotes itself entirely to serving as a meditation on the core ideas and emotions that swirl around in the bloody, beating heart of the franchise, and in that sense, Magia Record functions less as a fully-fledged companion piece to Madoka Magica and more like a bizarre piece of tone-poem fan-fiction. This is a complement, by the way.  It's why I can have a genuine emotional reaction to Kuroe's fall to despair in “How Long Do We Continue Being Magical Girls”, even though the character only just barely began making an impression in the back half of Season 2. It's why I can accept Alina's presence as the more straightforwardly destructive “villain” of the story, even though she barely exists as a character. It's why I can accept that this tonally confused adaptation of a failed mobile game decides to end in such an unrelentingly bleak fashion, where our heroes desperately fight for the opportunity to fail at everything they set out to do. Sure, Alina didn't turn literally every human on earth into a doomed Magical Girl, but the Magical Girls that already exist are still doomed. When Homura blips off to a new timeline in the ending montage, it might as well be her admission that this entire universe is a lost cause. The three “sisters” that Iroha fought so hard to protect are gone, the survivors of the Magius conflict are left with little more than a broken city and a million pieces to pick up, and absolutely nobody else in the world will ever even know what they suffered for. What they will suffer for.  Well, almost nobody. Madoka Magica is fundamentally a story about hope, and in that final shot of the celestial Madoka taking the Magia Record in her arms, we're reminded that it wasn't for nothing, not really. Every single moment that Iroha and the others spent fighting was worthwhile, because they matter. If there's any moral to take from this story, it's that every single Magical Girl matters, no matter how cliché or rushed or inconsistent their stories might be. There might be one particular girl who gets to have her name on the marquee, but there are hundreds of others just like her, fighting and failing and trying again, all of the time, even when they know that the best case scenario is only one or two degrees removed from complete despair.  So, in the end, Magia Record was sometimes just as disappointing and unfulfilling as we all feared it would be, and it was sometimes a beautiful little thing in spite of itself. It stumbled many times in its attempts to justify itself as a successor to one of the most popular and influential anime ever made, and while I would never argue that it surpasses Madoka Magica, I can tell you now that I am glad that Magia Record exists. It made its case, and it told its story. These girls can rest, for now, and maybe dream of something better that could be waiting for them, in another life. They've done enough.

Community score: 3.9              I don't think there was ever really a chance that Magia Record was going to outdo, or even fully live up to, the impossibly gargantuan reputation of Puella Magi Madoka Magica. That said, while the first two seasons of Magia Record were wildly uneven and overstuffed, the show was always this close to successfully making a case for its own existence. The universe of PMMM was always big, but its core story was a very personal one, and Magia Record offered us a welcome glimpse of the larger world of Magical Girls and Witches that Madoka and Co. always existed in, but rarely got to explore.  Sure, the plot relied way too much on dragged-out mysteries and featured a cast of characters multiple times larger than the original series', but there was always a lot of promise to the story of Iroha, Ui, and the Wings of Magius, even if that promise capped out at being “pretty decently okay” compared to its legendary older sibling. The real question going into this final “season” of Magia Record, titled “Dawn of a Shallow Dream”, was whether or not the series could live up to that potential at last.

The three “sisters” that Iroha fought so hard to protect are gone, the survivors of the Magius conflict are left with little more than a broken city and a million pieces to pick up, and absolutely nobody else in the world will ever even know what they suffered for. What they will suffer for.  Well, almost nobody. Madoka Magica is fundamentally a story about hope, and in that final shot of the celestial Madoka taking the Magia Record in her arms, we're reminded that it wasn't for nothing, not really. Every single moment that Iroha and the others spent fighting was worthwhile, because they matter. If there's any moral to take from this story, it's that every single Magical Girl matters, no matter how cliché or rushed or inconsistent their stories might be. There might be one particular girl who gets to have her name on the marquee, but there are hundreds of others just like her, fighting and failing and trying again, all of the time, even when they know that the best case scenario is only one or two degrees removed from complete despair.  So, in the end, Magia Record was sometimes just as disappointing and unfulfilling as we all feared it would be, and it was sometimes a beautiful little thing in spite of itself. It stumbled many times in its attempts to justify itself as a successor to one of the most popular and influential anime ever made, and while I would never argue that it surpasses Madoka Magica, I can tell you now that I am glad that Magia Record exists. It made its case, and it told its story. These girls can rest, for now, and maybe dream of something better that could be waiting for them, in another life. They've done enough.

Community score: 3.9              I don't think there was ever really a chance that Magia Record was going to outdo, or even fully live up to, the impossibly gargantuan reputation of Puella Magi Madoka Magica. That said, while the first two seasons of Magia Record were wildly uneven and overstuffed, the show was always this close to successfully making a case for its own existence. The universe of PMMM was always big, but its core story was a very personal one, and Magia Record offered us a welcome glimpse of the larger world of Magical Girls and Witches that Madoka and Co. always existed in, but rarely got to explore.  Sure, the plot relied way too much on dragged-out mysteries and featured a cast of characters multiple times larger than the original series', but there was always a lot of promise to the story of Iroha, Ui, and the Wings of Magius, even if that promise capped out at being “pretty decently okay” compared to its legendary older sibling. The real question going into this final “season” of Magia Record, titled “Dawn of a Shallow Dream”, was whether or not the series could live up to that potential at last. What is perhaps the most striking about “Dawn of a Fragile Dream”, then, is how successfully it is able to provide a conclusion to this series that genuinely works in the span of only four episodes.   “We Failed”, for instance, is one of those story-critical lore dumps that somehow manages to deliver answers to questions that we've been asking for years without disappointing entirely. Sure, the tragic backstory of Ui, Touka, and Nemu isn't especially surprising or shocking, but the arc of their fall from grace is very satisfying, and it successfully puts the previous two seasons into a more meaningful perspective. You understand why the trio would be willing to take on the burden of being Magical Girls to save Iroha and the others from their fates to become witches, and it's honestly awesome to see them not only figure out the truth of Kyubey's trick so quickly, but to come up with a solution that actually sounds like it might succeed, even though we all know that it can't.    It's too bad that the girls are characters in a Madoka Magica spinoff. Like so many other heroines of this franchise, Ui and her friends merely wanted to use the power of the Magical Girl to do good and protect the people they love, and all they got for it was the honor of dooming everybody to a different manner of existential hell. None of that is new or fresh for this franchise, but it sure does feel right. Plus, I'm just happy that ultimate explanation of Baby Kyubey is that it was last remnant of Ui's soul left from the girls' failed attempt to harness Kyubey's powers. I was so sure that the Baby Kyubey gimmick would end up being stupid and/or disappointing, and I ended up being pleasantly surprised.  With most of the lingering lore questions resolved, the remaining trio of episodes have the unenviable job of bringing the present day plot to a close, and you know what? I think they get the job done. It's not perfect, by any means; there was no way that every single girl was going to get the opportunity to have a neatly concluded character arc or emotional journey, but Magia Record makes its final hour count by eschewing the individual characters' stories in favor of giving its thematic concerns the attention they deserve (not to mention a bunch of gorgeously animated magical girl battles, naturally). Outside of Iroha, the Hospital Gang, and Kuroe, there is neither the time nor the space for the other girls to get more than one or two big moments, but in the cacophony of the final battle, those moments feel a lot more meaningful than they really should.   The sacrifice of Mifuyu and Momoko; the Doppel-fication of dozens of other girls; the grand spectacle of the final battle. None of these beats have had the buildup that they each deserve, but the supremely confident direction of Gekidan Inu Curry means that these episodes are still supremely engaging on an individual level in spite of the larger pacing problems that have plagued Magia Record on a big-picture level since Season 1. In these final episodes, Magia Record devotes itself entirely to serving as a meditation on the core ideas and emotions that swirl around in the bloody, beating heart of the franchise, and in that sense, Magia Record functions less as a fully-fledged companion piece to Madoka Magica and more like a bizarre piece of tone-poem fan-fiction. This is a complement, by the way.  It's why I can have a genuine emotional reaction to Kuroe's fall to despair in “How Long Do We Continue Being Magical Girls”, even though the character only just barely began making an impression in the back half of Season 2. It's why I can accept Alina's presence as the more straightforwardly destructive “villain” of the story, even though she barely exists as a character. It's why I can accept that this tonally confused adaptation of a failed mobile game decides to end in such an unrelentingly bleak fashion, where our heroes desperately fight for the opportunity to fail at everything they set out to do. Sure, Alina didn't turn literally every human on earth into a doomed Magical Girl, but the Magical Girls that already exist are still doomed. When Homura blips off to a new timeline in the ending montage, it might as well be her admission that this entire universe is a lost cause. The three “sisters” that Iroha fought so hard to protect are gone, the survivors of the Magius conflict are left with little more than a broken city and a million pieces to pick up, and absolutely nobody else in the world will ever even know what they suffered for.

The three-episode anime by Wit Studio will premiere on May 18 on the official Pokémon YouTube channel and the Pokémon TV app. The company unveiled a visual:     Kouki Uchiyama will play Alec (Akio), a mild-mannered young man who is studying to become a doctor. He is heading to the Hisui region in search of medicinal herbs. Rie Kugimiya will play young Alec. Rikiya Koyama will play Alec's father, a woodworker who recently moved to the Hisui region and has come to fear Pokémon after a certain incident. The anime will also feature Hisuian Zorua.    Ken Yamamoto (Princess Connect! Re:Dive) is directing the anime at Wit Studio. Taku Kishimoto (Fruits Basket, Haikyu!!) is the screenwriter. KURO is designing the characters. Ayaka Nakamura (Attack on Titan, Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!) is handling the color design. Yūji Kaneko (Little Witch Academia) is the art director. Takeru Yokoi (The Girl from the Other Side: Siúil, a Rún) is the director of photography. Akari Saitō (Spy×Family) is the offline editor. Masafumi Mima (Attack on Titan, Cardcaptor Sakura) is the sound director. Conisch (Hetalia The Beautiful World) is composing the music.    Pokémon Legends: Arceus launched worldwide for Switch on January 28.    The game takes place in the Hisui region, the past version of the Sinnoh region from the Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl games. Players join the Galaxy Expedition Team's Survey Corps in Jubilife Village to embark on survey outings and research Pokémon. Players can ride Pokémon and craft items, but are vulnerable to Pokémon attacks while out in the field. The game also features photography and trainer customization.    The game adds the new Pokémon Wyrdeer, an evolution of Stantler; Basculegion, an evolution of Basculin; and Kleavor, an evolution of Scyther. The game also introduces Hisuian forms of Braviary, Growlithe, Voltorb, and Zorua.    Pokémon can be captured by throwing Pokéballs. However, some Pokémon may flee or try to attack. Pokémon battles feature an action order combat system, in which the order a Pokémon attacks depends on its speed stat and moves. Pokémon can use moves in two different styles: strong style, which favors power over speed; and agile style, which prioritizes fast turns over strength.    Pokémon Legends: Arceus features a more open 3D style reminiscent of the Wild Area in the Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield games. The story also involves the mythical Pokémon Arceus. Starter Pokémon include Rowlet, Cyndaquil, and Oshawatt. The cover art (pictured left) depicts Mount Coronet and the bygone Sinnoh region.

News Wit Studio's Pokémon: Hisuian Snow Web Animated Series Premieres on May 18   posted on 2022-04-26 23:18 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         3-episode series based on Pokémon Legends: Arceus game    The Pokémon Company International announced on Tuesday that the online animated series set in the Hisui region, based on the Pokémon Legends: Arceus game, will be titled Pokémon: Hisuian Snow. The three-episode anime by Wit Studio will premiere on May 18 on the official Pokémon YouTube channel and the Pokémon TV app. The company unveiled a visual:     Kouki Uchiyama will play Alec (Akio), a mild-mannered young man who is studying to become a doctor. He is heading to the Hisui region in search of medicinal herbs. Rie Kugimiya will play young Alec. Rikiya Koyama will play Alec's father, a woodworker who recently moved to the Hisui region and has come to fear Pokémon after a certain incident. The anime will also feature Hisuian Zorua.    Ken Yamamoto (Princess Connect! Re:Dive) is directing the anime at Wit Studio. Taku Kishimoto (Fruits Basket, Haikyu!!) is the screenwriter. KURO is designing the characters. Ayaka Nakamura (Attack on Titan, Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!) is handling the color design. Yūji Kaneko (Little Witch Academia) is the art director. Takeru Yokoi (The Girl from the Other Side: Siúil, a Rún) is the director of photography. Akari Saitō (Spy×Family) is the offline editor. Masafumi Mima (Attack on Titan, Cardcaptor Sakura) is the sound director. Conisch (Hetalia The Beautiful World) is composing the music.    Pokémon Legends: Arceus launched worldwide for Switch on January 28.    The game takes place in the Hisui region, the past version of the Sinnoh region from the Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl games. Players join the Galaxy Expedition Team's Survey Corps in Jubilife Village to embark on survey outings and research Pokémon. Players can ride Pokémon and craft items, but are vulnerable to Pokémon attacks while out in the field. The game also features photography and trainer customization.    The game adds the new Pokémon Wyrdeer, an evolution of Stantler; Basculegion, an evolution of Basculin; and Kleavor, an evolution of Scyther. The game also introduces Hisuian forms of Braviary, Growlithe, Voltorb, and Zorua.    Pokémon can be captured by throwing Pokéballs. However, some Pokémon may flee or try to attack. Pokémon battles feature an action order combat system, in which the order a Pokémon attacks depends on its speed stat and moves. Pokémon can use moves in two different styles: strong style, which favors power over speed; and agile style, which prioritizes fast turns over strength.    Pokémon Legends: Arceus features a more open 3D style reminiscent of the Wild Area in the Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield games. The story also involves the mythical Pokémon Arceus. Starter Pokémon include Rowlet, Cyndaquil, and Oshawatt. The cover art (pictured left) depicts Mount Coronet and the bygone Sinnoh region.

News Wit Studio's Pokémon: Hisuian Snow Web Animated Series Premieres on May 18   posted on 2022-04-26 23:18 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         3-episode series based on Pokémon Legends: Arceus game    The Pokémon Company International announced on Tuesday that the online animated series set in the Hisui region, based on the Pokémon Legends: Arceus game, will be titled Pokémon: Hisuian Snow. The three-episode anime by Wit Studio will premiere on May 18 on the official Pokémon YouTube channel and the Pokémon TV app. The company unveiled a visual:     Kouki Uchiyama will play Alec (Akio), a mild-mannered young man who is studying to become a doctor. He is heading to the Hisui region in search of medicinal herbs. Rie Kugimiya will play young Alec. Rikiya Koyama will play Alec's father, a woodworker who recently moved to the Hisui region and has come to fear Pokémon after a certain incident. The anime will also feature Hisuian Zorua.    Ken Yamamoto (Princess Connect! Re:Dive) is directing the anime at Wit Studio. Taku Kishimoto (Fruits Basket, Haikyu!!) is the screenwriter. KURO is designing the characters. Ayaka Nakamura (Attack on Titan, Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!) is handling the color design. Yūji Kaneko (Little Witch Academia) is the art director. Takeru Yokoi (The Girl from the Other Side: Siúil, a Rún) is the director of photography. Akari Saitō (Spy×Family) is the offline editor. Masafumi Mima (Attack on Titan, Cardcaptor Sakura) is the sound director. Conisch (Hetalia The Beautiful World) is composing the music.    Pokémon Legends: Arceus launched worldwide for Switch on January 28.    The game takes place in the Hisui region, the past version of the Sinnoh region from the Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl games. Players join the Galaxy Expedition Team's Survey Corps in Jubilife Village to embark on survey outings and research Pokémon. Players can ride Pokémon and craft items, but are vulnerable to Pokémon attacks while out in the field. The game also features photography and trainer customization.    The game adds the new Pokémon Wyrdeer, an evolution of Stantler; Basculegion, an evolution of Basculin; and Kleavor, an evolution of Scyther. The game also introduces Hisuian forms of Braviary, Growlithe, Voltorb, and Zorua.    Pokémon can be captured by throwing Pokéballs. However, some Pokémon may flee or try to attack. Pokémon battles feature an action order combat system, in which the order a Pokémon attacks depends on its speed stat and moves. Pokémon can use moves in two different styles: strong style, which favors power over speed; and agile style, which prioritizes fast turns over strength.    Pokémon Legends: Arceus features a more open 3D style reminiscent of the Wild Area in the Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield games. The story also involves the mythical Pokémon Arceus. Starter Pokémon include Rowlet, Cyndaquil, and Oshawatt. The cover art (pictured left) depicts Mount Coronet and the bygone Sinnoh region.

The three-episode anime by Wit Studio will premiere on May 18 on the official Pokémon YouTube channel and the Pokémon TV app. The company unveiled a visual:     Kouki Uchiyama will play Alec (Akio), a mild-mannered young man who is studying to become a doctor. He is heading to the Hisui region in search of medicinal herbs. Rie Kugimiya will play young Alec. Rikiya Koyama will play Alec's father, a woodworker who recently moved to the Hisui region and has come to fear Pokémon after a certain incident. The anime will also feature Hisuian Zorua.    Ken Yamamoto (Princess Connect! Re:Dive) is directing the anime at Wit Studio. Taku Kishimoto (Fruits Basket, Haikyu!!) is the screenwriter. KURO is designing the characters. Ayaka Nakamura (Attack on Titan, Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!) is handling the color design. Yūji Kaneko (Little Witch Academia) is the art director. Takeru Yokoi (The Girl from the Other Side: Siúil, a Rún) is the director of photography. Akari Saitō (Spy×Family) is the offline editor. Masafumi Mima (Attack on Titan, Cardcaptor Sakura) is the sound director. Conisch (Hetalia The Beautiful World) is composing the music.    Pokémon Legends: Arceus launched worldwide for Switch on January 28.    The game takes place in the Hisui region, the past version of the Sinnoh region from the Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl games. Players join the Galaxy Expedition Team's Survey Corps in Jubilife Village to embark on survey outings and research Pokémon. Players can ride Pokémon and craft items, but are vulnerable to Pokémon attacks while out in the field. The game also features photography and trainer customization.    The game adds the new Pokémon Wyrdeer, an evolution of Stantler; Basculegion, an evolution of Basculin; and Kleavor, an evolution of Scyther. The game also introduces Hisuian forms of Braviary, Growlithe, Voltorb, and Zorua.    Pokémon can be captured by throwing Pokéballs. However, some Pokémon may flee or try to attack. Pokémon battles feature an action order combat system, in which the order a Pokémon attacks depends on its speed stat and moves. Pokémon can use moves in two different styles: strong style, which favors power over speed; and agile style, which prioritizes fast turns over strength.    Pokémon Legends: Arceus features a more open 3D style reminiscent of the Wild Area in the Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield games. The story also involves the mythical Pokémon Arceus. Starter Pokémon include Rowlet, Cyndaquil, and Oshawatt. The cover art (pictured left) depicts Mount Coronet and the bygone Sinnoh region.

News Nozomi Mino's Yakuza Lover Manga Ends in 3 Chapters   posted on 2022-04-24 01:15 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Romance manga debuted in 2018    The June issue of Shogakukan's Cheese! magazine revealed on Friday that Nozomi Mino's Yakuza Lover (Koi to Dangan) manga will end in three chapters, not including the chapter on Friday. If the manga does not take a break, it should end in the September issue that will ship in late July. The magazine also revealed that the manga has 4.4 million copies in circulation (including digital sales).    The manga's 10th volume had teased that the manga would reach its climax with the 11th volume, which will ship on May 26.    Viz Media is releasing the manga in English, and it describes the story:    When feisty college student Yuri is attacked at a party, she's saved by Toshiomi Oya, the underboss of a yakuza syndicate. Despite her obvious attraction to him, she convinces herself that she's not in the market for a bad boy type. But when they meet again, she finds herself irresistibly drawn to him—kicking off a steamy and dangerous love affair that threatens to consume her, body and soul.   After the attack at the party, Yuri goes to see Oya to thank him for saving her, and as much as she hates to admit it, she can't deny there's an attraction. However, when tragedy strikes, Yuri attempts to turn her back on Oya and his dangerous lifestyle for good—but will the allure prove too great to resist?   Mino launched the manga in Shogakukan's Premium Cheese! magazine in March 2018, before moving the series to the sister magazine Cheese! in April 2019. Viz Media published the manga's fourth volume on March 1.    Source: Cheese!

News Nozomi Mino's Yakuza Lover Manga Ends in 3 Chapters   posted on 2022-04-24 01:15 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Romance manga debuted in 2018    The June issue of Shogakukan's Cheese! magazine revealed on Friday that Nozomi Mino's Yakuza Lover (Koi to Dangan) manga will end in three chapters, not including the chapter on Friday. If the manga does not take a break, it should end in the September issue that will ship in late July. The magazine also revealed that the manga has 4.4 million copies in circulation (including digital sales).    The manga's 10th volume had teased that the manga would reach its climax with the 11th volume, which will ship on May 26.    Viz Media is releasing the manga in English, and it describes the story:    When feisty college student Yuri is attacked at a party, she's saved by Toshiomi Oya, the underboss of a yakuza syndicate. Despite her obvious attraction to him, she convinces herself that she's not in the market for a bad boy type. But when they meet again, she finds herself irresistibly drawn to him—kicking off a steamy and dangerous love affair that threatens to consume her, body and soul.   After the attack at the party, Yuri goes to see Oya to thank him for saving her, and as much as she hates to admit it, she can't deny there's an attraction. However, when tragedy strikes, Yuri attempts to turn her back on Oya and his dangerous lifestyle for good—but will the allure prove too great to resist?   Mino launched the manga in Shogakukan's Premium Cheese! magazine in March 2018, before moving the series to the sister magazine Cheese! in April 2019. Viz Media published the manga's fourth volume on March 1.    Source: Cheese!

News Nozomi Mino's Yakuza Lover Manga Ends in 3 Chapters   posted on 2022-04-24 01:15 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Romance manga debuted in 2018    The June issue of Shogakukan's Cheese! magazine revealed on Friday that Nozomi Mino's Yakuza Lover (Koi to Dangan) manga will end in three chapters, not including the chapter on Friday. If the manga does not take a break, it should end in the September issue that will ship in late July. The magazine also revealed that the manga has 4.4 million copies in circulation (including digital sales).    The manga's 10th volume had teased that the manga would reach its climax with the 11th volume, which will ship on May 26.    Viz Media is releasing the manga in English, and it describes the story:    When feisty college student Yuri is attacked at a party, she's saved by Toshiomi Oya, the underboss of a yakuza syndicate. Despite her obvious attraction to him, she convinces herself that she's not in the market for a bad boy type. But when they meet again, she finds herself irresistibly drawn to him—kicking off a steamy and dangerous love affair that threatens to consume her, body and soul.   After the attack at the party, Yuri goes to see Oya to thank him for saving her, and as much as she hates to admit it, she can't deny there's an attraction. However, when tragedy strikes, Yuri attempts to turn her back on Oya and his dangerous lifestyle for good—but will the allure prove too great to resist?   Mino launched the manga in Shogakukan's Premium Cheese! magazine in March 2018, before moving the series to the sister magazine Cheese! in April 2019. Viz Media published the manga's fourth volume on March 1.    Source: Cheese!

Ascendance of a Bookworm Season 3 Episode 29  by Christopher Farris, Apr 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 29 of Ascendance of a Bookworm (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.6            One relatively minor detail of this season of Ascendance of a Bookworm that I'm still going to quibble with is the question of how well Ferdinand and the rest of the church have been able to cover up Main's stay in the cathedral. It seemed like a well-publicized piece of information that many in her circle, as well as others they all interacted with, were in on. Except a major component of the storytelling this episode is how it's not just staying within the cathedral's walls that protects Main from the Ink Guild's designs — they apparently do not even know she's in there at all. It just comes off as odd, since the sheer number of people interacting with Main and keeping up on business with her hardly makes it seem like her current residence is supposed to be some kind of secret. But we get a couple scenes of the Ink Guild being stymied at trying to track her down at all, before they're unceremoniously written out of that element of the story later in the episode.    Like I said, minor detail, but I have to find something to at least lightly riff on, since otherwise this is an episode that's very much a simple sequence of setups. It honestly feels less like an episode in its own right and more like the very beginnings of four or five different episodes. For instance, one supposed focal element is the 'Dedication Ceremony', which sees Main and Ferdinand using prayer to fill grails with mana for the sake of the coming harvest. It's explained with details about why only these two can do it, and a couple passing complaints from Main about how long it will take, but then that time just passes and we're ready to move on to another coming spring ceremony. Another odd inclusion is the High Priest seemingly running some kind of mana side-hustle that he strong-arms Main into contributing to. It seems like this bit is mainly here to prompt interactions with Ferdinand and indicate how Main is finding herself further entrenched in inter-church political struggles. But then the subject of the High Priest's mana collection never comes up again in the whole episode, with the character only barely being mentioned in passing again later.    It's but one example of the bits and pieces of story that I'm sure we'll come back to later as this series continues on. But such fleeting fragments of setup with not even a slight inkling of payoff can make it feel like we're going down a checklist more than watching an actual story unfold. Some of these have the potential for more interesting integrated use, but don't come off strongly or consistently enough to land that way. An example of that is Damuel being assigned to be Main's bodyguard this episode. It seems like he might work as a fresh perspective to observe how her life at the cathedral goes on, or the life-decision changes she's going through, but ultimately not that much is done with it. We do reconvene with Damuel and Ferdinand conversing towards the end of the episode, but that really does feel more like a simple check-in rather than a natural culmination of any arc for Damuel as a result of accompanying Main all this time.    Now, the upshot of delivering plot elements in these sorts of bits and pieces is that at least some of them will work pretty well. Checking back in on Main's request for letter types is expectedly one of the good parts, since seeing our tiny bookworm's reactions to the nerdery of literary production is almost always entertaining. Ah, if only we could all have something we're so passionate about that the mere potential of inventing a printing press prompts exclamations of 'Gutenberg!' and a minor fainting spell. It's a keen reminder of both the quest Main has been pursuing all of this for and the question of how worthwhile that might ultimately be.    That leads back to the other strong point of this episode: the subject of Main possibly being adopted by a noble once she turns ten. It provides a reason to bring her parents back into the picture for a discussion, with some strong portrayals of the emotions the whole family is grappling with over this point, and their understanding of the pragmatism behind it that must be so valued in this kind of societal situation. Main is at the mercy of her status as a mana reserve which ironically is the reason she's even in the situation where she can entertain her other pursuits, and there's a sense of closing in as Ferdinand makes clear she's running out of places she can consistently and truly be safe. I know I already mentioned this point in last week's review, but it's through this story element that Ascendance of a Bookworm really convincingly crafts its argument that being the protagonist at the center of an isekai storyline would actually be pretty rough, and that's to its conceptual credit. It effectively intersects with the other harsh lessons Main is having to learn; Ten years old is way too early for someone to have to realize how much growing up sucks.    Those appreciable elements at the heart of this story are good, since so much of this episode is spending time wondering where any of its disparate threads will end up going. There's a procedural feeling to much of it, except it also feels like it keeps forgetting about its current task and just hopping onto another one. I don't doubt that it'll tie most of these things together eventually, but I also know that 'eventually' can be a long time in a story like this.

Ascendance of a Bookworm Season 3 Episode 29  by Christopher Farris, Apr 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 29 of Ascendance of a Bookworm (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.6            One relatively minor detail of this season of Ascendance of a Bookworm that I'm still going to quibble with is the question of how well Ferdinand and the rest of the church have been able to cover up Main's stay in the cathedral. It seemed like a well-publicized piece of information that many in her circle, as well as others they all interacted with, were in on. Except a major component of the storytelling this episode is how it's not just staying within the cathedral's walls that protects Main from the Ink Guild's designs — they apparently do not even know she's in there at all. It just comes off as odd, since the sheer number of people interacting with Main and keeping up on business with her hardly makes it seem like her current residence is supposed to be some kind of secret. But we get a couple scenes of the Ink Guild being stymied at trying to track her down at all, before they're unceremoniously written out of that element of the story later in the episode.    Like I said, minor detail, but I have to find something to at least lightly riff on, since otherwise this is an episode that's very much a simple sequence of setups. It honestly feels less like an episode in its own right and more like the very beginnings of four or five different episodes. For instance, one supposed focal element is the 'Dedication Ceremony', which sees Main and Ferdinand using prayer to fill grails with mana for the sake of the coming harvest. It's explained with details about why only these two can do it, and a couple passing complaints from Main about how long it will take, but then that time just passes and we're ready to move on to another coming spring ceremony. Another odd inclusion is the High Priest seemingly running some kind of mana side-hustle that he strong-arms Main into contributing to. It seems like this bit is mainly here to prompt interactions with Ferdinand and indicate how Main is finding herself further entrenched in inter-church political struggles. But then the subject of the High Priest's mana collection never comes up again in the whole episode, with the character only barely being mentioned in passing again later.    It's but one example of the bits and pieces of story that I'm sure we'll come back to later as this series continues on. But such fleeting fragments of setup with not even a slight inkling of payoff can make it feel like we're going down a checklist more than watching an actual story unfold. Some of these have the potential for more interesting integrated use, but don't come off strongly or consistently enough to land that way. An example of that is Damuel being assigned to be Main's bodyguard this episode. It seems like he might work as a fresh perspective to observe how her life at the cathedral goes on, or the life-decision changes she's going through, but ultimately not that much is done with it. We do reconvene with Damuel and Ferdinand conversing towards the end of the episode, but that really does feel more like a simple check-in rather than a natural culmination of any arc for Damuel as a result of accompanying Main all this time.    Now, the upshot of delivering plot elements in these sorts of bits and pieces is that at least some of them will work pretty well. Checking back in on Main's request for letter types is expectedly one of the good parts, since seeing our tiny bookworm's reactions to the nerdery of literary production is almost always entertaining. Ah, if only we could all have something we're so passionate about that the mere potential of inventing a printing press prompts exclamations of 'Gutenberg!' and a minor fainting spell. It's a keen reminder of both the quest Main has been pursuing all of this for and the question of how worthwhile that might ultimately be.    That leads back to the other strong point of this episode: the subject of Main possibly being adopted by a noble once she turns ten. It provides a reason to bring her parents back into the picture for a discussion, with some strong portrayals of the emotions the whole family is grappling with over this point, and their understanding of the pragmatism behind it that must be so valued in this kind of societal situation. Main is at the mercy of her status as a mana reserve which ironically is the reason she's even in the situation where she can entertain her other pursuits, and there's a sense of closing in as Ferdinand makes clear she's running out of places she can consistently and truly be safe. I know I already mentioned this point in last week's review, but it's through this story element that Ascendance of a Bookworm really convincingly crafts its argument that being the protagonist at the center of an isekai storyline would actually be pretty rough, and that's to its conceptual credit. It effectively intersects with the other harsh lessons Main is having to learn; Ten years old is way too early for someone to have to realize how much growing up sucks.    Those appreciable elements at the heart of this story are good, since so much of this episode is spending time wondering where any of its disparate threads will end up going. There's a procedural feeling to much of it, except it also feels like it keeps forgetting about its current task and just hopping onto another one. I don't doubt that it'll tie most of these things together eventually, but I also know that 'eventually' can be a long time in a story like this.    Rating:                 Ascendance of a Bookworm Season 3 is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

Ascendance of a Bookworm Season 3 Episode 29  by Christopher Farris, Apr 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 29 of Ascendance of a Bookworm (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.6            One relatively minor detail of this season of Ascendance of a Bookworm that I'm still going to quibble with is the question of how well Ferdinand and the rest of the church have been able to cover up Main's stay in the cathedral. It seemed like a well-publicized piece of information that many in her circle, as well as others they all interacted with, were in on. Except a major component of the storytelling this episode is how it's not just staying within the cathedral's walls that protects Main from the Ink Guild's designs — they apparently do not even know she's in there at all. It just comes off as odd, since the sheer number of people interacting with Main and keeping up on business with her hardly makes it seem like her current residence is supposed to be some kind of secret. But we get a couple scenes of the Ink Guild being stymied at trying to track her down at all, before they're unceremoniously written out of that element of the story later in the episode.    Like I said, minor detail, but I have to find something to at least lightly riff on, since otherwise this is an episode that's very much a simple sequence of setups. It honestly feels less like an episode in its own right and more like the very beginnings of four or five different episodes. For instance, one supposed focal element is the 'Dedication Ceremony', which sees Main and Ferdinand using prayer to fill grails with mana for the sake of the coming harvest. It's explained with details about why only these two can do it, and a couple passing complaints from Main about how long it will take, but then that time just passes and we're ready to move on to another coming spring ceremony. Another odd inclusion is the High Priest seemingly running some kind of mana side-hustle that he strong-arms Main into contributing to. It seems like this bit is mainly here to prompt interactions with Ferdinand and indicate how Main is finding herself further entrenched in inter-church political struggles. But then the subject of the High Priest's mana collection never comes up again in the whole episode, with the character only barely being mentioned in passing again later.    It's but one example of the bits and pieces of story that I'm sure we'll come back to later as this series continues on. But such fleeting fragments of setup with not even a slight inkling of payoff can make it feel like we're going down a checklist more than watching an actual story unfold. Some of these have the potential for more interesting integrated use, but don't come off strongly or consistently enough to land that way. An example of that is Damuel being assigned to be Main's bodyguard this episode. It seems like he might work as a fresh perspective to observe how her life at the cathedral goes on, or the life-decision changes she's going through, but ultimately not that much is done with it. We do reconvene with Damuel and Ferdinand conversing towards the end of the episode, but that really does feel more like a simple check-in rather than a natural culmination of any arc for Damuel as a result of accompanying Main all this time.    Now, the upshot of delivering plot elements in these sorts of bits and pieces is that at least some of them will work pretty well. Checking back in on Main's request for letter types is expectedly one of the good parts, since seeing our tiny bookworm's reactions to the nerdery of literary production is almost always entertaining. Ah, if only we could all have something we're so passionate about that the mere potential of inventing a printing press prompts exclamations of 'Gutenberg!' and a minor fainting spell. It's a keen reminder of both the quest Main has been pursuing all of this for and the question of how worthwhile that might ultimately be.    That leads back to the other strong point of this episode: the subject of Main possibly being adopted by a noble once she turns ten. It provides a reason to bring her parents back into the picture for a discussion, with some strong portrayals of the emotions the whole family is grappling with over this point, and their understanding of the pragmatism behind it that must be so valued in this kind of societal situation. Main is at the mercy of her status as a mana reserve which ironically is the reason she's even in the situation where she can entertain her other pursuits, and there's a sense of closing in as Ferdinand makes clear she's running out of places she can consistently and truly be safe. I know I already mentioned this point in last week's review, but it's through this story element that Ascendance of a Bookworm really convincingly crafts its argument that being the protagonist at the center of an isekai storyline would actually be pretty rough, and that's to its conceptual credit. It effectively intersects with the other harsh lessons Main is having to learn; Ten years old is way too early for someone to have to realize how much growing up sucks.    Those appreciable elements at the heart of this story are good, since so much of this episode is spending time wondering where any of its disparate threads will end up going. There's a procedural feeling to much of it, except it also feels like it keeps forgetting about its current task and just hopping onto another one. I don't doubt that it'll tie most of these things together eventually, but I also know that 'eventually' can be a long time in a story like this.    Rating:                 Ascendance of a Bookworm Season 3 is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 22nd 2022       The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You Volume 1                      Synopsis:             Rentaro Aijo is a hopeless romantic – emphasis on ""hopeless"". Before starting high school he'd already confessed his love to 100 different girls, and was rejected every time. But a trip to a local shrine of the God of Love brings him good fortune, of a kind. Due to a clerical error in the heavens, Rentaro is indeed guaranteed to find that special someone – 100 of them, to be precise. He is destined to have triple-digit soulmates, and it's up to him to find them all, cherish them all, and keep this Love Hectogon stable, lest disaster befall him and his many, many, many, many loves.      Review:         Synopsis:        Rentaro Aijo is a hopeless romantic – emphasis on ""hopeless"". Before starting high school he'd already confessed his love to 100 different girls, and was rejected every time. But a trip to a local shrine of the God of Love brings him good fortune, of a kind. Due to a clerical error in the heavens, Rentaro is indeed guaranteed to find that special someone – 100 of them, to be precise. He is destined to have triple-digit soulmates, and it's up to him to find them all, cherish them all, and keep this Love Hectogon stable, lest disaster befall him and his many, many, many, many loves.     Review:            Now I know what you're probably thinking, just from looking at that title. 100? Really? That's obviously some hyperbolic number meant to pull you in, right? There's no way any series could actually introduce a hundred different girls and still function! And I get it. You're a savvy consumer. You know big numbers like that are only ever there for a marketing pitch. It's not like Yamada from B-Gata H-Kei ever slept with 100 guys in high school. If you're my age you're probably still haunted by the broken promise of 100 Good Deeds for Eddie McDowd. We all know how this works.    The thing is, you're thinking about this premise with logic, and logic has no home in this manga. The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You runs off of pure, lovestruck insanity. I firmly believe the authors have read every single harem manga ever written, and in the process allowed a fungus to spawn inside their brains, eventually devouring their gray matter entirely and leaving a large, heart-shaped mushroom that can recite every line of To-Love-Ru by heart. On the surface, its premise might sound similar to other self-aware harem series like The World God Only Knows, but those stories still had their sanity. In this world, sanity left to buy cigarettes 10 years ago and never came home. So while Rentaro may “only” be up to three official girlfriends by the end of this first volume, I wholeheartedly believe this series intends to hit its titular goal some day, without caveat.    All that is to say that this series is goofy as all hell. It's not trying to tell anything resembling a serious love story, and it wants to make that apparent immediately. The reason Rentaro is destined to have a hundred girlfriends is because the God of Love got distracted watching Laputa: Castle in the Sky, and accidentally put a couple extra zeroes in his Divine Spreadsheet. Shizuka, aka Girlfriend Numero Tres, is so shy she can't speak, but instead of writing out her thoughts she has fully memorized her favorite fantasy novel, and flips through pages to point at different lines in order to communicate. When Rentaro realizes he only has a single “first kiss” to split between two girlfriends, he devises a Danganronpa-level double-blind scenario with sensory deprivation and random numbers to create Schrodinger's First Kiss. This is a farce, it knows it, and if you can get on that wavelength it becomes a ton of fun.    This is very much a comedy of escalation, taking any given harem manga trope – the bashful girl with big boobs, the standoffish tsundere, the hapless lead who nonetheless attracts women like a fly catcher – and cranking up their inherent absurdity until they shoot the moon and becoming endearing through sheer intensity. Rentaro isn't just a nice guy; he's the nicest guy ever, willing to pull a week of all-nighters just to transcribe Shizuka's book into a text file so she can use it with her phone's text-to-speech function. In a bonus chapter, it's revealed he's been making doomed confessions since he learned to talk, and getting dumped from the literal crib. It's not strictly a parody of harem conventions, but it's deeply familiar with them and very happy to drive full force to their (il)logical extremes. It's funny enough in its own right, but gets extra hilarious if you're familiar with harem comedies and recognize just how off the ranch the series takes these familiar ideas.    The characters, while broad and simple, also do great in managing all that energy. While basically everyone with a speaking role is some kind of dumbass, they're all their own distinct flavor of stupid, bringing strange ideas and perspectives to each chapter while still being able to play straightman to any other character's brand of idiocy. That's an important factor with a constantly expanding cast that promises to climb into the triple digits by the time it ends, and gives hope for 100 Girlfriends to have some longevity beyond this first volume. It also helps that they're all written to genuinely love each other. In a story about 100-timing, Rentaro could easily come off as a crass jerk collecting girls like trading cards, but he's such an over-the-top sap that you firmly believe he loves all his soulmates equally and without exception. The girls themselves take a while to warm up to the idea of polyamory, but by the end of the volume they've all come to like and accept one another. This isn't what I'd call a wholesome series, but in its absurdity it has little patience to spare for meanspirited cynicism.    Yukiko Nozawa's art also helps a lot in that department. Each of our (so far) four main characters has a distinct look and visual personality, which is critical in juggling so many characters with identical motivations. More importantly, the characters are wildly expressive, able to contort their faces into both cute and grotesque visages depending on what the joke calls for, and it sells the comedy perfectly. Their background in porn is also readily apparent, as this is still a Ghost Ship release. While it's not as blatantly raunchy as fellow Jump+ title 2.5 Dimensional Seduction, all three of Rentaro's girlfriends are hot for his harem protag bod, and are down to clown in the very near future. There's a LOT of heart-shaped pupils in this book, if you know what I mean. But that all ultimately gels with the humor and energy of the rest of the jokes, and since everyone here is very obviously enjoying themselves, I can't complain. Just maybe don't read this in polite company.    100 Girlfriends is a premise that, by any metric, should not work. But through a sharp sense of humor, writing that 1000% commits to the bit, and excellent art, it doesn't just work: it excels. If you're a fan of more typical romcoms, you're likely to get a kick out of it, but even if you hate harem series, it may just manage worm its way into your heart through confidence alone.             Grade:      Overall : A Story : B+ Art : A  + Great and clever comedy, expressive character art, knows exactly what it's doing even if it shouldn't work − Can feel like playing inside baseball with the harem genre, may be too horny for some            discuss this in the forum (14 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history       				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story: Rikito Nakamura   Art: Yukiko Nozawa   Full encyclopedia details about100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 22nd 2022       The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You Volume 1                      Synopsis:             Rentaro Aijo is a hopeless romantic – emphasis on ""hopeless"". Before starting high school he'd already confessed his love to 100 different girls, and was rejected every time. But a trip to a local shrine of the God of Love brings him good fortune, of a kind. Due to a clerical error in the heavens, Rentaro is indeed guaranteed to find that special someone – 100 of them, to be precise. He is destined to have triple-digit soulmates, and it's up to him to find them all, cherish them all, and keep this Love Hectogon stable, lest disaster befall him and his many, many, many, many loves.      Review:         Synopsis:        Rentaro Aijo is a hopeless romantic – emphasis on ""hopeless"". Before starting high school he'd already confessed his love to 100 different girls, and was rejected every time. But a trip to a local shrine of the God of Love brings him good fortune, of a kind. Due to a clerical error in the heavens, Rentaro is indeed guaranteed to find that special someone – 100 of them, to be precise. He is destined to have triple-digit soulmates, and it's up to him to find them all, cherish them all, and keep this Love Hectogon stable, lest disaster befall him and his many, many, many, many loves.     Review:            Now I know what you're probably thinking, just from looking at that title. 100? Really? That's obviously some hyperbolic number meant to pull you in, right? There's no way any series could actually introduce a hundred different girls and still function! And I get it. You're a savvy consumer. You know big numbers like that are only ever there for a marketing pitch. It's not like Yamada from B-Gata H-Kei ever slept with 100 guys in high school. If you're my age you're probably still haunted by the broken promise of 100 Good Deeds for Eddie McDowd. We all know how this works.    The thing is, you're thinking about this premise with logic, and logic has no home in this manga. The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You runs off of pure, lovestruck insanity. I firmly believe the authors have read every single harem manga ever written, and in the process allowed a fungus to spawn inside their brains, eventually devouring their gray matter entirely and leaving a large, heart-shaped mushroom that can recite every line of To-Love-Ru by heart. On the surface, its premise might sound similar to other self-aware harem series like The World God Only Knows, but those stories still had their sanity. In this world, sanity left to buy cigarettes 10 years ago and never came home. So while Rentaro may “only” be up to three official girlfriends by the end of this first volume, I wholeheartedly believe this series intends to hit its titular goal some day, without caveat.    All that is to say that this series is goofy as all hell. It's not trying to tell anything resembling a serious love story, and it wants to make that apparent immediately. The reason Rentaro is destined to have a hundred girlfriends is because the God of Love got distracted watching Laputa: Castle in the Sky, and accidentally put a couple extra zeroes in his Divine Spreadsheet. Shizuka, aka Girlfriend Numero Tres, is so shy she can't speak, but instead of writing out her thoughts she has fully memorized her favorite fantasy novel, and flips through pages to point at different lines in order to communicate. When Rentaro realizes he only has a single “first kiss” to split between two girlfriends, he devises a Danganronpa-level double-blind scenario with sensory deprivation and random numbers to create Schrodinger's First Kiss. This is a farce, it knows it, and if you can get on that wavelength it becomes a ton of fun.    This is very much a comedy of escalation, taking any given harem manga trope – the bashful girl with big boobs, the standoffish tsundere, the hapless lead who nonetheless attracts women like a fly catcher – and cranking up their inherent absurdity until they shoot the moon and becoming endearing through sheer intensity. Rentaro isn't just a nice guy; he's the nicest guy ever, willing to pull a week of all-nighters just to transcribe Shizuka's book into a text file so she can use it with her phone's text-to-speech function. In a bonus chapter, it's revealed he's been making doomed confessions since he learned to talk, and getting dumped from the literal crib. It's not strictly a parody of harem conventions, but it's deeply familiar with them and very happy to drive full force to their (il)logical extremes. It's funny enough in its own right, but gets extra hilarious if you're familiar with harem comedies and recognize just how off the ranch the series takes these familiar ideas.    The characters, while broad and simple, also do great in managing all that energy. While basically everyone with a speaking role is some kind of dumbass, they're all their own distinct flavor of stupid, bringing strange ideas and perspectives to each chapter while still being able to play straightman to any other character's brand of idiocy. That's an important factor with a constantly expanding cast that promises to climb into the triple digits by the time it ends, and gives hope for 100 Girlfriends to have some longevity beyond this first volume. It also helps that they're all written to genuinely love each other. In a story about 100-timing, Rentaro could easily come off as a crass jerk collecting girls like trading cards, but he's such an over-the-top sap that you firmly believe he loves all his soulmates equally and without exception. The girls themselves take a while to warm up to the idea of polyamory, but by the end of the volume they've all come to like and accept one another. This isn't what I'd call a wholesome series, but in its absurdity it has little patience to spare for meanspirited cynicism.    Yukiko Nozawa's art also helps a lot in that department. Each of our (so far) four main characters has a distinct look and visual personality, which is critical in juggling so many characters with identical motivations. More importantly, the characters are wildly expressive, able to contort their faces into both cute and grotesque visages depending on what the joke calls for, and it sells the comedy perfectly. Their background in porn is also readily apparent, as this is still a Ghost Ship release. While it's not as blatantly raunchy as fellow Jump+ title 2.5 Dimensional Seduction, all three of Rentaro's girlfriends are hot for his harem protag bod, and are down to clown in the very near future. There's a LOT of heart-shaped pupils in this book, if you know what I mean. But that all ultimately gels with the humor and energy of the rest of the jokes, and since everyone here is very obviously enjoying themselves, I can't complain. Just maybe don't read this in polite company.    100 Girlfriends is a premise that, by any metric, should not work. But through a sharp sense of humor, writing that 1000% commits to the bit, and excellent art, it doesn't just work: it excels. If you're a fan of more typical romcoms, you're likely to get a kick out of it, but even if you hate harem series, it may just manage worm its way into your heart through confidence alone.             Grade:      Overall : A Story : B+ Art : A  + Great and clever comedy, expressive character art, knows exactly what it's doing even if it shouldn't work − Can feel like playing inside baseball with the harem genre, may be too horny for some            discuss this in the forum (14 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history       				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story: Rikito Nakamura   Art: Yukiko Nozawa   Full encyclopedia details about100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 22nd 2022       The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You Volume 1                      Synopsis:             Rentaro Aijo is a hopeless romantic – emphasis on ""hopeless"". Before starting high school he'd already confessed his love to 100 different girls, and was rejected every time. But a trip to a local shrine of the God of Love brings him good fortune, of a kind. Due to a clerical error in the heavens, Rentaro is indeed guaranteed to find that special someone – 100 of them, to be precise. He is destined to have triple-digit soulmates, and it's up to him to find them all, cherish them all, and keep this Love Hectogon stable, lest disaster befall him and his many, many, many, many loves.      Review:         Synopsis:        Rentaro Aijo is a hopeless romantic – emphasis on ""hopeless"". Before starting high school he'd already confessed his love to 100 different girls, and was rejected every time. But a trip to a local shrine of the God of Love brings him good fortune, of a kind. Due to a clerical error in the heavens, Rentaro is indeed guaranteed to find that special someone – 100 of them, to be precise. He is destined to have triple-digit soulmates, and it's up to him to find them all, cherish them all, and keep this Love Hectogon stable, lest disaster befall him and his many, many, many, many loves.     Review:            Now I know what you're probably thinking, just from looking at that title. 100? Really? That's obviously some hyperbolic number meant to pull you in, right? There's no way any series could actually introduce a hundred different girls and still function! And I get it. You're a savvy consumer. You know big numbers like that are only ever there for a marketing pitch. It's not like Yamada from B-Gata H-Kei ever slept with 100 guys in high school. If you're my age you're probably still haunted by the broken promise of 100 Good Deeds for Eddie McDowd. We all know how this works.    The thing is, you're thinking about this premise with logic, and logic has no home in this manga. The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You runs off of pure, lovestruck insanity. I firmly believe the authors have read every single harem manga ever written, and in the process allowed a fungus to spawn inside their brains, eventually devouring their gray matter entirely and leaving a large, heart-shaped mushroom that can recite every line of To-Love-Ru by heart. On the surface, its premise might sound similar to other self-aware harem series like The World God Only Knows, but those stories still had their sanity. In this world, sanity left to buy cigarettes 10 years ago and never came home. So while Rentaro may “only” be up to three official girlfriends by the end of this first volume, I wholeheartedly believe this series intends to hit its titular goal some day, without caveat.    All that is to say that this series is goofy as all hell. It's not trying to tell anything resembling a serious love story, and it wants to make that apparent immediately. The reason Rentaro is destined to have a hundred girlfriends is because the God of Love got distracted watching Laputa: Castle in the Sky, and accidentally put a couple extra zeroes in his Divine Spreadsheet. Shizuka, aka Girlfriend Numero Tres, is so shy she can't speak, but instead of writing out her thoughts she has fully memorized her favorite fantasy novel, and flips through pages to point at different lines in order to communicate. When Rentaro realizes he only has a single “first kiss” to split between two girlfriends, he devises a Danganronpa-level double-blind scenario with sensory deprivation and random numbers to create Schrodinger's First Kiss. This is a farce, it knows it, and if you can get on that wavelength it becomes a ton of fun.    This is very much a comedy of escalation, taking any given harem manga trope – the bashful girl with big boobs, the standoffish tsundere, the hapless lead who nonetheless attracts women like a fly catcher – and cranking up their inherent absurdity until they shoot the moon and becoming endearing through sheer intensity. Rentaro isn't just a nice guy; he's the nicest guy ever, willing to pull a week of all-nighters just to transcribe Shizuka's book into a text file so she can use it with her phone's text-to-speech function. In a bonus chapter, it's revealed he's been making doomed confessions since he learned to talk, and getting dumped from the literal crib. It's not strictly a parody of harem conventions, but it's deeply familiar with them and very happy to drive full force to their (il)logical extremes. It's funny enough in its own right, but gets extra hilarious if you're familiar with harem comedies and recognize just how off the ranch the series takes these familiar ideas.    The characters, while broad and simple, also do great in managing all that energy. While basically everyone with a speaking role is some kind of dumbass, they're all their own distinct flavor of stupid, bringing strange ideas and perspectives to each chapter while still being able to play straightman to any other character's brand of idiocy. That's an important factor with a constantly expanding cast that promises to climb into the triple digits by the time it ends, and gives hope for 100 Girlfriends to have some longevity beyond this first volume. It also helps that they're all written to genuinely love each other. In a story about 100-timing, Rentaro could easily come off as a crass jerk collecting girls like trading cards, but he's such an over-the-top sap that you firmly believe he loves all his soulmates equally and without exception. The girls themselves take a while to warm up to the idea of polyamory, but by the end of the volume they've all come to like and accept one another. This isn't what I'd call a wholesome series, but in its absurdity it has little patience to spare for meanspirited cynicism.    Yukiko Nozawa's art also helps a lot in that department. Each of our (so far) four main characters has a distinct look and visual personality, which is critical in juggling so many characters with identical motivations. More importantly, the characters are wildly expressive, able to contort their faces into both cute and grotesque visages depending on what the joke calls for, and it sells the comedy perfectly. Their background in porn is also readily apparent, as this is still a Ghost Ship release. While it's not as blatantly raunchy as fellow Jump+ title 2.5 Dimensional Seduction, all three of Rentaro's girlfriends are hot for his harem protag bod, and are down to clown in the very near future. There's a LOT of heart-shaped pupils in this book, if you know what I mean. But that all ultimately gels with the humor and energy of the rest of the jokes, and since everyone here is very obviously enjoying themselves, I can't complain. Just maybe don't read this in polite company.    100 Girlfriends is a premise that, by any metric, should not work. But through a sharp sense of humor, writing that 1000% commits to the bit, and excellent art, it doesn't just work: it excels. If you're a fan of more typical romcoms, you're likely to get a kick out of it, but even if you hate harem series, it may just manage worm its way into your heart through confidence alone.

Visit news.dexclub.com for all the latest news in Thai.                Advertising              Thank you for your interest in advertising on Anime News Network. Founded in 1998, Anime News Network is the world's leading source of up to date news and information on the anime and manga industries. Regular readers of Anime News Network not only include hundreds of thousands of anime fans, but also all of the industry heavy weights. The past several years have witnessed an attrition of English anime news sites on the Internet; as the number of sites shrink, the remaining sites only get better. Consistently growing and improving, Anime News Network is here to stay. The key benefit in advertising on Anime News Network is that our readership fits a particular demographic; mature anime fans. The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN. Provide ANN with up to $5,000 of advertising in your program guide or on site, and we will provide you an equal value on ANN.  Other Anime, manga and geek culture conventions: We provide a 50% trade with no max value. You can pay for half the value of your advertisements on ANN with advertisements in your program guide or on-site. EG: If you give us $5,000 of ads at the convention, you only have to pay us $5,000 for $10,000 worth of advertising on ANN.  For Networks We are not looking for any advertising networks at this time. Agencies and rep firms are welcome to contact us, but no networks/exchanges/rtb platforms. No Bootlegs! No Pirates! Important: Don't waste our time if you sell bootleg/pirate DVDs or host unlicensed content on your website. Not only will we not allow you to advertise with us, but we'll probably report you to the appropriate authorities, licensors and/or licensees. We do not consider gray market imports of otherwise legal goods, or doujinshi, ""bootlegs,"" although we may require potential advertisers to prove that their gray market imports are legal goods.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

Founded in 1998, Anime News Network is the world's leading source of up to date news and information on the anime and manga industries. Regular readers of Anime News Network not only include hundreds of thousands of anime fans, but also all of the industry heavy weights. The past several years have witnessed an attrition of English anime news sites on the Internet; as the number of sites shrink, the remaining sites only get better. Consistently growing and improving, Anime News Network is here to stay. The key benefit in advertising on Anime News Network is that our readership fits a particular demographic; mature anime fans. The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN. Provide ANN with up to $5,000 of advertising in your program guide or on site, and we will provide you an equal value on ANN.  Other Anime, manga and geek culture conventions: We provide a 50% trade with no max value. You can pay for half the value of your advertisements on ANN with advertisements in your program guide or on-site. EG: If you give us $5,000 of ads at the convention, you only have to pay us $5,000 for $10,000 worth of advertising on ANN.  For Networks We are not looking for any advertising networks at this time. Agencies and rep firms are welcome to contact us, but no networks/exchanges/rtb platforms. No Bootlegs! No Pirates! Important: Don't waste our time if you sell bootleg/pirate DVDs or host unlicensed content on your website.

The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN.

Wacky misunderstandings are not needed to move the plot forward, and having characters talk about their inevitable issues paints them as a bit more likeable to me. Its why I really liked Wotakoi and the first episodes of Horimiya.   Its a great show to watch on my lunch break, at present, though I do hope it develops a more compelling identity going forward.

The animation, the direction, the VA work, are all incredibly on-point and just as adorable. Saori Onishi is great as Shikimori.   I'm actually kind of surprised at the negative reception I've seen online in other circles. I guess it seems like maybe too much of a fluffy romcom with no ""meat"" compared to others in the genre or too much of a wish-fulfillment dynamic in the leads' relationship. I've seen a lot of people that just don't care for Izumi or find anything believable in Shikimori going out with him, other than the fact that she seems necessary in terms of keeping him alive or getting Isekai-ed by Truck-kun.     I hope future episodes improve peoples' opinions on the series or maybe it just doesn't have what they're looking for...although I still really enjoy it.

However, the first volume of the manga was so boring that I had to have friends who stuck with it saying how good it was to go back to it and now it’s one of my faves. This is a story about a relationship between two people very much in love and that is it. That’s the story. And, honestly, the mild bumps in the road are fine but it doesn’t need high drama   This is a love for the sake of love story and it’s absolutely perfect that way, for my money.

Thats working against it, considering the last 2 years has been stacked with really fantastic rom-coms like takagi 3, Kaguya season 3, love after world domination, MDUD, Tonikaku Kawaii, and Nagatoro.    I really want to like it, since Rom-Coms are my thing but right now it just comes across as dull. Tonikaku Kawaii and even Nagatoro (though more in the stuff that happens after the first season) are able to pull off wholesome romance without ever feeling boring.

It looks very pretty. The opening theme in particular. Some of the supporting characters are pretty fun, especially best girl Hachimitsu. And there's definitely some dramatic intrigue there that I trust the show will treat with a respectful amount of seriousness. But it doesn't really feel like anything is happening, even in the context of a slice-of-life. The atmosphere of its script is more than a little bland. Shikimori's ""coolness"" is too inconsistent for what my expectations of them were. Izumi's unfortunate luck is even moreso, and actually wore down on me faster than it did in Tenchi Muyo! GXP when it was Seina's gimmick. In the second episode, it got way too predictable to be worthy of even a sensible chuckle, and aggravating enough that I'm convinced half of it is the fault of Izumi being too stupid to remember that he was, to quote every synopsis of Ah! My Goddess I've come across online, ""born under an unlucky star"". He's the kind of stupid that ableists use to justify why some children should be left behind. I won't be surprised if I end up hating him enough that it breaks me free of the curse I've had since ""Stanley's Cup"" of me liking every protagonist I come across, even the incorrigible ones. I also won't be surprised if the show itself improves enough by the halfway point that I can say, ""it's pretty good"".

Two votes. It's that interplay that tells you ""hey, these people really like each other and we think that's super rad."" I know there are other reasons to like Spice & Wolf, but the two main characters just talking to each other pushes the series to another level of excellence.   You love to see it.

Tonikaku Kawaii and even Nagatoro (though more in the stuff that happens after the first season) are able to pull off wholesome romance without ever feeling boring.           I feel like it's very similar to Tonikawa in terms of quickly establishing the couple and focusing more on their drama-free romance and growing relationship with some supporting cast...and I'd say Shikimori is kind of in the same cool beauty vein as Tsukasa, they just emphasize it more, but I think that's to the shows' benefit. Although I think a lot of people found Nasa maybe more palatable than Izumi is at a first glance.    I definitely think there's a lot of competition this season...Kaguya season 3, Love after World Domination, Aharen-san, Science Fell in Love, and I guess even DAL is kind of romcom-ish amidst all the Battle Harem antics. But I think Shikimori does what it's base appeal is very well, and I enjoy watching it.

Good folks that don't really know what to do about their son's....condition? State? I dunno, but it is nether normal nor healthy. And are incredibly supportive of Shikimori as well.   As for her, we get a few teases on her family circumstances. A decent relationship with her brother, but the parents are absent, either literally or emotionally (that part's just a guess, given her ""haven't had a homecooked meal in forever"" comment.) I'm curious, definitely.   Its a solid show thats gotten better each episode imo. Its releasing at an awful season, with so much competition its genre, but I've been enjoying it a lot.

He's constantly at risk or hurting himself but he pays it no mind and is still such a kind and outgoing person, and puts others above himself, which is why she fell for him and why she's so determined to protect him.    Feel like girls in romcoms being good with horror movies while their boyfriends aren't is becoming a new thing. Well, other than Marin.    I was not expecting Hiro Shimono as Shikimori's brother. I also love Shikimori with her natural wavy hair and glasses. And the Shikimori fashion show! Her actual date outfit was perfect.    That was a pretty cute and fun meet-the-parents moment. Shikimori basically making Izumi's parents fall in love with her as much as Izumi did and Shikimori finding out the klutziness is genetic.

Wacky misunderstandings are not needed to move the plot forward, and having characters talk about their inevitable issues paints them as a bit more likeable to me. Its why I really liked Wotakoi and the first episodes of Horimiya.   Its a great show to watch on my lunch break, at present, though I do hope it develops a more compelling identity going forward.

The animation, the direction, the VA work, are all incredibly on-point and just as adorable. Saori Onishi is great as Shikimori.   I'm actually kind of surprised at the negative reception I've seen online in other circles. I guess it seems like maybe too much of a fluffy romcom with no ""meat"" compared to others in the genre or too much of a wish-fulfillment dynamic in the leads' relationship. I've seen a lot of people that just don't care for Izumi or find anything believable in Shikimori going out with him, other than the fact that she seems necessary in terms of keeping him alive or getting Isekai-ed by Truck-kun.     I hope future episodes improve peoples' opinions on the series or maybe it just doesn't have what they're looking for...although I still really enjoy it.

However, the first volume of the manga was so boring that I had to have friends who stuck with it saying how good it was to go back to it and now it’s one of my faves. This is a story about a relationship between two people very much in love and that is it. That’s the story. And, honestly, the mild bumps in the road are fine but it doesn’t need high drama   This is a love for the sake of love story and it’s absolutely perfect that way, for my money.

Thats working against it, considering the last 2 years has been stacked with really fantastic rom-coms like takagi 3, Kaguya season 3, love after world domination, MDUD, Tonikaku Kawaii, and Nagatoro.    I really want to like it, since Rom-Coms are my thing but right now it just comes across as dull. Tonikaku Kawaii and even Nagatoro (though more in the stuff that happens after the first season) are able to pull off wholesome romance without ever feeling boring.

It looks very pretty. The opening theme in particular. Some of the supporting characters are pretty fun, especially best girl Hachimitsu. And there's definitely some dramatic intrigue there that I trust the show will treat with a respectful amount of seriousness. But it doesn't really feel like anything is happening, even in the context of a slice-of-life. The atmosphere of its script is more than a little bland. Shikimori's ""coolness"" is too inconsistent for what my expectations of them were. Izumi's unfortunate luck is even moreso, and actually wore down on me faster than it did in Tenchi Muyo! GXP when it was Seina's gimmick. In the second episode, it got way too predictable to be worthy of even a sensible chuckle, and aggravating enough that I'm convinced half of it is the fault of Izumi being too stupid to remember that he was, to quote every synopsis of Ah! My Goddess I've come across online, ""born under an unlucky star"". He's the kind of stupid that ableists use to justify why some children should be left behind. I won't be surprised if I end up hating him enough that it breaks me free of the curse I've had since ""Stanley's Cup"" of me liking every protagonist I come across, even the incorrigible ones. I also won't be surprised if the show itself improves enough by the halfway point that I can say, ""it's pretty good"".

Two votes. It's that interplay that tells you ""hey, these people really like each other and we think that's super rad."" I know there are other reasons to like Spice & Wolf, but the two main characters just talking to each other pushes the series to another level of excellence.   You love to see it.

I feel like it's very similar to Tonikawa in terms of quickly establishing the couple and focusing more on their drama-free romance and growing relationship with some supporting cast...and I'd say Shikimori is kind of in the same cool beauty vein as Tsukasa, they just emphasize it more, but I think that's to the shows' benefit. Although I think a lot of people found Nasa maybe more palatable than Izumi is at a first glance.    I definitely think there's a lot of competition this season...Kaguya season 3, Love after World Domination, Aharen-san, Science Fell in Love, and I guess even DAL is kind of romcom-ish amidst all the Battle Harem antics. But I think Shikimori does what it's base appeal is very well, and I enjoy watching it.

Good folks that don't really know what to do about their son's....condition? State? I dunno, but it is nether normal nor healthy. And are incredibly supportive of Shikimori as well.   As for her, we get a few teases on her family circumstances. A decent relationship with her brother, but the parents are absent, either literally or emotionally (that part's just a guess, given her ""haven't had a homecooked meal in forever"" comment.) I'm curious, definitely.   Its a solid show thats gotten better each episode imo. Its releasing at an awful season, with so much competition its genre, but I've been enjoying it a lot.

He's constantly at risk or hurting himself but he pays it no mind and is still such a kind and outgoing person, and puts others above himself, which is why she fell for him and why she's so determined to protect him.    Feel like girls in romcoms being good with horror movies while their boyfriends aren't is becoming a new thing. Well, other than Marin.    I was not expecting Hiro Shimono as Shikimori's brother. I also love Shikimori with her natural wavy hair and glasses. And the Shikimori fashion show! Her actual date outfit was perfect.    That was a pretty cute and fun meet-the-parents moment. Shikimori basically making Izumi's parents fall in love with her as much as Izumi did and Shikimori finding out the klutziness is genetic.

Wacky misunderstandings are not needed to move the plot forward, and having characters talk about their inevitable issues paints them as a bit more likeable to me. Its why I really liked Wotakoi and the first episodes of Horimiya.   Its a great show to watch on my lunch break, at present, though I do hope it develops a more compelling identity going forward.

The animation, the direction, the VA work, are all incredibly on-point and just as adorable. Saori Onishi is great as Shikimori.   I'm actually kind of surprised at the negative reception I've seen online in other circles. I guess it seems like maybe too much of a fluffy romcom with no ""meat"" compared to others in the genre or too much of a wish-fulfillment dynamic in the leads' relationship. I've seen a lot of people that just don't care for Izumi or find anything believable in Shikimori going out with him, other than the fact that she seems necessary in terms of keeping him alive or getting Isekai-ed by Truck-kun.     I hope future episodes improve peoples' opinions on the series or maybe it just doesn't have what they're looking for...although I still really enjoy it.

However, the first volume of the manga was so boring that I had to have friends who stuck with it saying how good it was to go back to it and now it’s one of my faves. This is a story about a relationship between two people very much in love and that is it. That’s the story. And, honestly, the mild bumps in the road are fine but it doesn’t need high drama   This is a love for the sake of love story and it’s absolutely perfect that way, for my money.

Thats working against it, considering the last 2 years has been stacked with really fantastic rom-coms like takagi 3, Kaguya season 3, love after world domination, MDUD, Tonikaku Kawaii, and Nagatoro.    I really want to like it, since Rom-Coms are my thing but right now it just comes across as dull. Tonikaku Kawaii and even Nagatoro (though more in the stuff that happens after the first season) are able to pull off wholesome romance without ever feeling boring.

It looks very pretty. The opening theme in particular. Some of the supporting characters are pretty fun, especially best girl Hachimitsu. And there's definitely some dramatic intrigue there that I trust the show will treat with a respectful amount of seriousness. But it doesn't really feel like anything is happening, even in the context of a slice-of-life. The atmosphere of its script is more than a little bland. Shikimori's ""coolness"" is too inconsistent for what my expectations of them were. Izumi's unfortunate luck is even moreso, and actually wore down on me faster than it did in Tenchi Muyo! GXP when it was Seina's gimmick. In the second episode, it got way too predictable to be worthy of even a sensible chuckle, and aggravating enough that I'm convinced half of it is the fault of Izumi being too stupid to remember that he was, to quote every synopsis of Ah! My Goddess I've come across online, ""born under an unlucky star"". He's the kind of stupid that ableists use to justify why some children should be left behind. I won't be surprised if I end up hating him enough that it breaks me free of the curse I've had since ""Stanley's Cup"" of me liking every protagonist I come across, even the incorrigible ones. I also won't be surprised if the show itself improves enough by the halfway point that I can say, ""it's pretty good"".

Two votes. It's that interplay that tells you ""hey, these people really like each other and we think that's super rad."" I know there are other reasons to like Spice & Wolf, but the two main characters just talking to each other pushes the series to another level of excellence.   You love to see it.

I feel like it's very similar to Tonikawa in terms of quickly establishing the couple and focusing more on their drama-free romance and growing relationship with some supporting cast...and I'd say Shikimori is kind of in the same cool beauty vein as Tsukasa, they just emphasize it more, but I think that's to the shows' benefit. Although I think a lot of people found Nasa maybe more palatable than Izumi is at a first glance.    I definitely think there's a lot of competition this season...Kaguya season 3, Love after World Domination, Aharen-san, Science Fell in Love, and I guess even DAL is kind of romcom-ish amidst all the Battle Harem antics. But I think Shikimori does what it's base appeal is very well, and I enjoy watching it.

Good folks that don't really know what to do about their son's....condition? State? I dunno, but it is nether normal nor healthy. And are incredibly supportive of Shikimori as well.   As for her, we get a few teases on her family circumstances. A decent relationship with her brother, but the parents are absent, either literally or emotionally (that part's just a guess, given her ""haven't had a homecooked meal in forever"" comment.) I'm curious, definitely.   Its a solid show thats gotten better each episode imo. Its releasing at an awful season, with so much competition its genre, but I've been enjoying it a lot.

He's constantly at risk or hurting himself but he pays it no mind and is still such a kind and outgoing person, and puts others above himself, which is why she fell for him and why she's so determined to protect him.    Feel like girls in romcoms being good with horror movies while their boyfriends aren't is becoming a new thing. Well, other than Marin.    I was not expecting Hiro Shimono as Shikimori's brother. I also love Shikimori with her natural wavy hair and glasses. And the Shikimori fashion show! Her actual date outfit was perfect.    That was a pretty cute and fun meet-the-parents moment. Shikimori basically making Izumi's parents fall in love with her as much as Izumi did and Shikimori finding out the klutziness is genetic.

Wacky misunderstandings are not needed to move the plot forward, and having characters talk about their inevitable issues paints them as a bit more likeable to me. Its why I really liked Wotakoi and the first episodes of Horimiya.   Its a great show to watch on my lunch break, at present, though I do hope it develops a more compelling identity going forward.

The animation, the direction, the VA work, are all incredibly on-point and just as adorable. Saori Onishi is great as Shikimori.   I'm actually kind of surprised at the negative reception I've seen online in other circles. I guess it seems like maybe too much of a fluffy romcom with no ""meat"" compared to others in the genre or too much of a wish-fulfillment dynamic in the leads' relationship. I've seen a lot of people that just don't care for Izumi or find anything believable in Shikimori going out with him, other than the fact that she seems necessary in terms of keeping him alive or getting Isekai-ed by Truck-kun.     I hope future episodes improve peoples' opinions on the series or maybe it just doesn't have what they're looking for...although I still really enjoy it.

However, the first volume of the manga was so boring that I had to have friends who stuck with it saying how good it was to go back to it and now it’s one of my faves. This is a story about a relationship between two people very much in love and that is it. That’s the story. And, honestly, the mild bumps in the road are fine but it doesn’t need high drama   This is a love for the sake of love story and it’s absolutely perfect that way, for my money.

Thats working against it, considering the last 2 years has been stacked with really fantastic rom-coms like takagi 3, Kaguya season 3, love after world domination, MDUD, Tonikaku Kawaii, and Nagatoro.    I really want to like it, since Rom-Coms are my thing but right now it just comes across as dull. Tonikaku Kawaii and even Nagatoro (though more in the stuff that happens after the first season) are able to pull off wholesome romance without ever feeling boring.

It looks very pretty. The opening theme in particular. Some of the supporting characters are pretty fun, especially best girl Hachimitsu. And there's definitely some dramatic intrigue there that I trust the show will treat with a respectful amount of seriousness. But it doesn't really feel like anything is happening, even in the context of a slice-of-life. The atmosphere of its script is more than a little bland. Shikimori's ""coolness"" is too inconsistent for what my expectations of them were. Izumi's unfortunate luck is even moreso, and actually wore down on me faster than it did in Tenchi Muyo! GXP when it was Seina's gimmick. In the second episode, it got way too predictable to be worthy of even a sensible chuckle, and aggravating enough that I'm convinced half of it is the fault of Izumi being too stupid to remember that he was, to quote every synopsis of Ah! My Goddess I've come across online, ""born under an unlucky star"". He's the kind of stupid that ableists use to justify why some children should be left behind. I won't be surprised if I end up hating him enough that it breaks me free of the curse I've had since ""Stanley's Cup"" of me liking every protagonist I come across, even the incorrigible ones. I also won't be surprised if the show itself improves enough by the halfway point that I can say, ""it's pretty good"".

Two votes. It's that interplay that tells you ""hey, these people really like each other and we think that's super rad."" I know there are other reasons to like Spice & Wolf, but the two main characters just talking to each other pushes the series to another level of excellence.   You love to see it.

Tonikaku Kawaii and even Nagatoro (though more in the stuff that happens after the first season) are able to pull off wholesome romance without ever feeling boring.           I feel like it's very similar to Tonikawa in terms of quickly establishing the couple and focusing more on their drama-free romance and growing relationship with some supporting cast...and I'd say Shikimori is kind of in the same cool beauty vein as Tsukasa, they just emphasize it more, but I think that's to the shows' benefit. Although I think a lot of people found Nasa maybe more palatable than Izumi is at a first glance.    I definitely think there's a lot of competition this season...Kaguya season 3, Love after World Domination, Aharen-san, Science Fell in Love, and I guess even DAL is kind of romcom-ish amidst all the Battle Harem antics. But I think Shikimori does what it's base appeal is very well, and I enjoy watching it.

Good folks that don't really know what to do about their son's....condition? State? I dunno, but it is nether normal nor healthy. And are incredibly supportive of Shikimori as well.   As for her, we get a few teases on her family circumstances. A decent relationship with her brother, but the parents are absent, either literally or emotionally (that part's just a guess, given her ""haven't had a homecooked meal in forever"" comment.) I'm curious, definitely.   Its a solid show thats gotten better each episode imo. Its releasing at an awful season, with so much competition its genre, but I've been enjoying it a lot.

He's constantly at risk or hurting himself but he pays it no mind and is still such a kind and outgoing person, and puts others above himself, which is why she fell for him and why she's so determined to protect him.    Feel like girls in romcoms being good with horror movies while their boyfriends aren't is becoming a new thing. Well, other than Marin.    I was not expecting Hiro Shimono as Shikimori's brother. I also love Shikimori with her natural wavy hair and glasses. And the Shikimori fashion show! Her actual date outfit was perfect.    That was a pretty cute and fun meet-the-parents moment. Shikimori basically making Izumi's parents fall in love with her as much as Izumi did and Shikimori finding out the klutziness is genetic.

Bookwalker Global is Adding I'll Never Send a Selfie Again! to Their Lineup of Exclusive Titles   Apr 26th 2022         April 26th, 2022 – BOOK WALKER Global has partnered with Kodansha USA Publishing to exclusively release the full-color series I'll Never Send a Selfie Again! by Takeya Takekake digitally on their platform.  I'll Never Send a Selfie Again!, Takeya Takekake's debut work, is a popular ongoing full-color and digital only series in Japan with 5 volumes released so far.   BOOK WALKER Global will release the manga series digitally in English, and describes the story as follows:   I'll Never Send a Selfie Again!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (309 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (309 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (309 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.

However, there are some scenes which I found to be a bit better in the manga such as the grenade ring proposal. Don’t get me wrong, it was still well-executed.   I do appreciate how they successfully recreated the range of facial expressions from Anya (so far)    Anyways, I’m super excited for spoiler[ Bond and Henry ] I think the former will appear towards the end of this first cour? Guess it depends on the pacing for the rest of the episodes      Back to top                  Tanteikingdomkey    Joined: 03 Sep 2008 		    Posts: 2294       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 12:28 pm            SO I showed this to my parents and some others and they absolutely loved it.    It somehow rides that line of absured/ fantasy enough while being grounded and relatable to most peoples experiences. Honestly if there was an MCU type anime, I really think that this would be it.  It is still anime but it is very very approchable and inviting to non anime fans      Back to top                   Hal14    Joined: 01 Apr 2018 		    Posts: 425 		    Location: Heart of africa 		        Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 12:39 pm            Domestic comedies (a.k.a. family sitcoms) are one of the most approachable kinds of shows. Almost everybody has a favorite. I'm surprised there aren't a lot of these in anime/manga, possibly a cultural thing which might be why the setting is pseudo-europe      Back to top                  TarsTarkas    Joined: 20 Dec 2007 		    Posts: 5329 		    Location: Virginia, United States 		        Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 12:49 pm            Loved the manga, and the anime adaptation is firing on all cylinders.

I really wish episode 2 had severely curtail the bitchy office lady and party scene so that we could have had more Anya scene instead, I ended up skimming toward the end. Or at the very least bring Anya in and have her read the bitchy OL mind instead of having them talk behind Yor back in front of her.

It is kind of funny how Takuya Eguchi and Saori Hayami are paired again but they still have amazing chemistry.    Loid is the stoic and driven super-spy who has no time for a family but a secret heart of gold that cares for others that places him on his mission and draws him to his fake family.   Anya is as adorable as ever and her telepathy is comedy gold, and she has the best reaction faces in anime form. She's never truly had a family but now she has a shot at one and loves how crazy it all is.    Yor is a classic Hayamin character who is a lethal, yet slightly ditzy, raven-haired beauty who can fight, kill, and sneak up on someone in heels. She's cute, a little too straightforward for her own good, but it plays off Loid and others quite well. Now hopefully her co-workers finally get off her back.    And just like Anya who saw how exciting it would be for a spy and an assassin to end up together (with a grenade proposal/marriage to boot), I can't wait to see this family come together! And the Opening really captures their vibe perfectly.

With how extremely gullible she seems to be and the general... spacey oblivious vibe she gives off I'm finding it hard to buy her as an assassin.   That is to say, she's clearly very VERY capable, but as someone who was trained as a child and has been doing this well into her 20s how has she not been caught and/or not gotten more perceptive over the years? Obviously the show is a comedy and there's some suspension of disbelief here, but if someone believes that chucking a steel pipe at at man with a gun is ""The latest therapy for my patient who's having an episode"" than one would think she might not have the most success at keeping her top secret job secret.

The writing is rather flawed to say the least. Anya is an enjoyable character but everything else falls pretty flat for me. Definitely not a 9/10 show... maybe a 5/10 at best.

The basic deal with Spy x Family as a comedy is everyone is kind of a huge dumbass, as is the case with most comedies. Loid's a lot better at hiding it since he's more booksmart and adaptable because that's his job, but I don't think people comment enough on the fact that he's a dingus in his own right, especially when it comes to common sense. None of Yor's actions twigged his suspicions either (though she at least came up with slightly better excuses than he did). He's so used to operating in a world of spies he doesn't seem to have a good idea of how a normal person would react to danger (a lot less calmly than Yor), and that's the comedy. It's meant to be absurd.   For Yor, the concept is that she's spent so much of her life focused becoming the best at murder she doesn't have many life skills outside of that and honestly, she isn't great at hiding her 'true job', but everyone around her is also a loopy space case so that's okay.

He's so hypercompetent and used to action that all of Yor's amazing feats register as fairly normal on his radar.

I like the fact that despite giving her psychic abilities where most shows would try and make her more mature and smarter than the adults around her, instead the story has done the smart thing and given her the same mind, emotions and motivations of a naive child which is more believable, allows for more comedy and is also so totally precious and cute!   Loid is also perfect for what his role is. The tug of war between dedication to his profession and results versus his now burgeoning father-tendencies is what makes this show, and I'm sure this will also include Yor whom he will start to care for as a wife and mother in due time while blissfully unaware of her actual profession.   Yor is definitely the dumbest of the trio, but I believe this makes sense, as it's likely her past is very tragic and much similar to Anya's where she's been bred since childhood to be an efficient killing machine, and thus so long as she serves that role, nobody cares that she is ignorant and awkward in real life, and in fact, this likely deliberately helps her  maintain her cover as nobody would suspect the nitwit of being a proficient assassin so their guards are habitually let down around her and they also look down on her for it. Her mix of beauty and dimwittery are useful for getting salicious male targets to approach her.   I'm already a fan, and there's quite a bit of buzz around this due to the source material, so this looks like it's going to be a great time!

However, there are some scenes which I found to be a bit better in the manga such as the grenade ring proposal. Don’t get me wrong, it was still well-executed.   I do appreciate how they successfully recreated the range of facial expressions from Anya (so far)    Anyways, I’m super excited for spoiler[ Bond and Henry ] I think the former will appear towards the end of this first cour? Guess it depends on the pacing for the rest of the episodes      Back to top                  Tanteikingdomkey    Joined: 03 Sep 2008 		    Posts: 2294       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 12:28 pm            SO I showed this to my parents and some others and they absolutely loved it.    It somehow rides that line of absured/ fantasy enough while being grounded and relatable to most peoples experiences. Honestly if there was an MCU type anime, I really think that this would be it.  It is still anime but it is very very approchable and inviting to non anime fans      Back to top                   Hal14    Joined: 01 Apr 2018 		    Posts: 425 		    Location: Heart of africa 		        Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 12:39 pm            Domestic comedies (a.k.a. family sitcoms) are one of the most approachable kinds of shows. Almost everybody has a favorite. I'm surprised there aren't a lot of these in anime/manga, possibly a cultural thing which might be why the setting is pseudo-europe      Back to top                  TarsTarkas    Joined: 20 Dec 2007 		    Posts: 5329 		    Location: Virginia, United States 		        Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 12:49 pm            Loved the manga, and the anime adaptation is firing on all cylinders.

I really wish episode 2 had severely curtail the bitchy office lady and party scene so that we could have had more Anya scene instead, I ended up skimming toward the end. Or at the very least bring Anya in and have her read the bitchy OL mind instead of having them talk behind Yor back in front of her.

It is kind of funny how Takuya Eguchi and Saori Hayami are paired again but they still have amazing chemistry.    Loid is the stoic and driven super-spy who has no time for a family but a secret heart of gold that cares for others that places him on his mission and draws him to his fake family.   Anya is as adorable as ever and her telepathy is comedy gold, and she has the best reaction faces in anime form. She's never truly had a family but now she has a shot at one and loves how crazy it all is.    Yor is a classic Hayamin character who is a lethal, yet slightly ditzy, raven-haired beauty who can fight, kill, and sneak up on someone in heels. She's cute, a little too straightforward for her own good, but it plays off Loid and others quite well. Now hopefully her co-workers finally get off her back.    And just like Anya who saw how exciting it would be for a spy and an assassin to end up together (with a grenade proposal/marriage to boot), I can't wait to see this family come together! And the Opening really captures their vibe perfectly.

With how extremely gullible she seems to be and the general... spacey oblivious vibe she gives off I'm finding it hard to buy her as an assassin.   That is to say, she's clearly very VERY capable, but as someone who was trained as a child and has been doing this well into her 20s how has she not been caught and/or not gotten more perceptive over the years? Obviously the show is a comedy and there's some suspension of disbelief here, but if someone believes that chucking a steel pipe at at man with a gun is ""The latest therapy for my patient who's having an episode"" than one would think she might not have the most success at keeping her top secret job secret.

The writing is rather flawed to say the least. Anya is an enjoyable character but everything else falls pretty flat for me. Definitely not a 9/10 show... maybe a 5/10 at best.

The basic deal with Spy x Family as a comedy is everyone is kind of a huge dumbass, as is the case with most comedies. Loid's a lot better at hiding it since he's more booksmart and adaptable because that's his job, but I don't think people comment enough on the fact that he's a dingus in his own right, especially when it comes to common sense. None of Yor's actions twigged his suspicions either (though she at least came up with slightly better excuses than he did). He's so used to operating in a world of spies he doesn't seem to have a good idea of how a normal person would react to danger (a lot less calmly than Yor), and that's the comedy. It's meant to be absurd.   For Yor, the concept is that she's spent so much of her life focused becoming the best at murder she doesn't have many life skills outside of that and honestly, she isn't great at hiding her 'true job', but everyone around her is also a loopy space case so that's okay.

He's so hypercompetent and used to action that all of Yor's amazing feats register as fairly normal on his radar.

I like the fact that despite giving her psychic abilities where most shows would try and make her more mature and smarter than the adults around her, instead the story has done the smart thing and given her the same mind, emotions and motivations of a naive child which is more believable, allows for more comedy and is also so totally precious and cute!   Loid is also perfect for what his role is. The tug of war between dedication to his profession and results versus his now burgeoning father-tendencies is what makes this show, and I'm sure this will also include Yor whom he will start to care for as a wife and mother in due time while blissfully unaware of her actual profession.   Yor is definitely the dumbest of the trio, but I believe this makes sense, as it's likely her past is very tragic and much similar to Anya's where she's been bred since childhood to be an efficient killing machine, and thus so long as she serves that role, nobody cares that she is ignorant and awkward in real life, and in fact, this likely deliberately helps her  maintain her cover as nobody would suspect the nitwit of being a proficient assassin so their guards are habitually let down around her and they also look down on her for it. Her mix of beauty and dimwittery are useful for getting salicious male targets to approach her.   I'm already a fan, and there's quite a bit of buzz around this due to the source material, so this looks like it's going to be a great time!

However, there are some scenes which I found to be a bit better in the manga such as the grenade ring proposal. Don’t get me wrong, it was still well-executed.   I do appreciate how they successfully recreated the range of facial expressions from Anya (so far)    Anyways, I’m super excited for spoiler[ Bond and Henry ] I think the former will appear towards the end of this first cour? Guess it depends on the pacing for the rest of the episodes      Back to top                  Tanteikingdomkey    Joined: 03 Sep 2008 		    Posts: 2294       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 12:28 pm            SO I showed this to my parents and some others and they absolutely loved it.    It somehow rides that line of absured/ fantasy enough while being grounded and relatable to most peoples experiences. Honestly if there was an MCU type anime, I really think that this would be it.  It is still anime but it is very very approchable and inviting to non anime fans      Back to top                   Hal14    Joined: 01 Apr 2018 		    Posts: 425 		    Location: Heart of africa 		        Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 12:39 pm            Domestic comedies (a.k.a. family sitcoms) are one of the most approachable kinds of shows. Almost everybody has a favorite. I'm surprised there aren't a lot of these in anime/manga, possibly a cultural thing which might be why the setting is pseudo-europe      Back to top                  TarsTarkas    Joined: 20 Dec 2007 		    Posts: 5329 		    Location: Virginia, United States 		        Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 12:49 pm            Loved the manga, and the anime adaptation is firing on all cylinders.

I really wish episode 2 had severely curtail the bitchy office lady and party scene so that we could have had more Anya scene instead, I ended up skimming toward the end. Or at the very least bring Anya in and have her read the bitchy OL mind instead of having them talk behind Yor back in front of her.

It is kind of funny how Takuya Eguchi and Saori Hayami are paired again but they still have amazing chemistry.    Loid is the stoic and driven super-spy who has no time for a family but a secret heart of gold that cares for others that places him on his mission and draws him to his fake family.   Anya is as adorable as ever and her telepathy is comedy gold, and she has the best reaction faces in anime form. She's never truly had a family but now she has a shot at one and loves how crazy it all is.    Yor is a classic Hayamin character who is a lethal, yet slightly ditzy, raven-haired beauty who can fight, kill, and sneak up on someone in heels. She's cute, a little too straightforward for her own good, but it plays off Loid and others quite well. Now hopefully her co-workers finally get off her back.    And just like Anya who saw how exciting it would be for a spy and an assassin to end up together (with a grenade proposal/marriage to boot), I can't wait to see this family come together! And the Opening really captures their vibe perfectly.

With how extremely gullible she seems to be and the general... spacey oblivious vibe she gives off I'm finding it hard to buy her as an assassin.   That is to say, she's clearly very VERY capable, but as someone who was trained as a child and has been doing this well into her 20s how has she not been caught and/or not gotten more perceptive over the years? Obviously the show is a comedy and there's some suspension of disbelief here, but if someone believes that chucking a steel pipe at at man with a gun is ""The latest therapy for my patient who's having an episode"" than one would think she might not have the most success at keeping her top secret job secret.

The writing is rather flawed to say the least. Anya is an enjoyable character but everything else falls pretty flat for me. Definitely not a 9/10 show... maybe a 5/10 at best.

The basic deal with Spy x Family as a comedy is everyone is kind of a huge dumbass, as is the case with most comedies. Loid's a lot better at hiding it since he's more booksmart and adaptable because that's his job, but I don't think people comment enough on the fact that he's a dingus in his own right, especially when it comes to common sense. None of Yor's actions twigged his suspicions either (though she at least came up with slightly better excuses than he did). He's so used to operating in a world of spies he doesn't seem to have a good idea of how a normal person would react to danger (a lot less calmly than Yor), and that's the comedy. It's meant to be absurd.   For Yor, the concept is that she's spent so much of her life focused becoming the best at murder she doesn't have many life skills outside of that and honestly, she isn't great at hiding her 'true job', but everyone around her is also a loopy space case so that's okay.

He's so hypercompetent and used to action that all of Yor's amazing feats register as fairly normal on his radar.

I like the fact that despite giving her psychic abilities where most shows would try and make her more mature and smarter than the adults around her, instead the story has done the smart thing and given her the same mind, emotions and motivations of a naive child which is more believable, allows for more comedy and is also so totally precious and cute!   Loid is also perfect for what his role is. The tug of war between dedication to his profession and results versus his now burgeoning father-tendencies is what makes this show, and I'm sure this will also include Yor whom he will start to care for as a wife and mother in due time while blissfully unaware of her actual profession.   Yor is definitely the dumbest of the trio, but I believe this makes sense, as it's likely her past is very tragic and much similar to Anya's where she's been bred since childhood to be an efficient killing machine, and thus so long as she serves that role, nobody cares that she is ignorant and awkward in real life, and in fact, this likely deliberately helps her  maintain her cover as nobody would suspect the nitwit of being a proficient assassin so their guards are habitually let down around her and they also look down on her for it. Her mix of beauty and dimwittery are useful for getting salicious male targets to approach her.   I'm already a fan, and there's quite a bit of buzz around this due to the source material, so this looks like it's going to be a great time!

I really wish episode 2 had severely curtail the bitchy office lady and party scene so that we could have had more Anya scene instead, I ended up skimming toward the end. Or at the very least bring Anya in and have her read the bitchy OL mind instead of having them talk behind Yor back in front of her.

It is kind of funny how Takuya Eguchi and Saori Hayami are paired again but they still have amazing chemistry.    Loid is the stoic and driven super-spy who has no time for a family but a secret heart of gold that cares for others that places him on his mission and draws him to his fake family.   Anya is as adorable as ever and her telepathy is comedy gold, and she has the best reaction faces in anime form. She's never truly had a family but now she has a shot at one and loves how crazy it all is.    Yor is a classic Hayamin character who is a lethal, yet slightly ditzy, raven-haired beauty who can fight, kill, and sneak up on someone in heels. She's cute, a little too straightforward for her own good, but it plays off Loid and others quite well. Now hopefully her co-workers finally get off her back.    And just like Anya who saw how exciting it would be for a spy and an assassin to end up together (with a grenade proposal/marriage to boot), I can't wait to see this family come together! And the Opening really captures their vibe perfectly.

With how extremely gullible she seems to be and the general... spacey oblivious vibe she gives off I'm finding it hard to buy her as an assassin.   That is to say, she's clearly very VERY capable, but as someone who was trained as a child and has been doing this well into her 20s how has she not been caught and/or not gotten more perceptive over the years? Obviously the show is a comedy and there's some suspension of disbelief here, but if someone believes that chucking a steel pipe at at man with a gun is ""The latest therapy for my patient who's having an episode"" than one would think she might not have the most success at keeping her top secret job secret.

The writing is rather flawed to say the least. Anya is an enjoyable character but everything else falls pretty flat for me. Definitely not a 9/10 show... maybe a 5/10 at best.

The basic deal with Spy x Family as a comedy is everyone is kind of a huge dumbass, as is the case with most comedies. Loid's a lot better at hiding it since he's more booksmart and adaptable because that's his job, but I don't think people comment enough on the fact that he's a dingus in his own right, especially when it comes to common sense. None of Yor's actions twigged his suspicions either (though she at least came up with slightly better excuses than he did). He's so used to operating in a world of spies he doesn't seem to have a good idea of how a normal person would react to danger (a lot less calmly than Yor), and that's the comedy. It's meant to be absurd.   For Yor, the concept is that she's spent so much of her life focused becoming the best at murder she doesn't have many life skills outside of that and honestly, she isn't great at hiding her 'true job', but everyone around her is also a loopy space case so that's okay.

He's so hypercompetent and used to action that all of Yor's amazing feats register as fairly normal on his radar.

I like the fact that despite giving her psychic abilities where most shows would try and make her more mature and smarter than the adults around her, instead the story has done the smart thing and given her the same mind, emotions and motivations of a naive child which is more believable, allows for more comedy and is also so totally precious and cute!   Loid is also perfect for what his role is. The tug of war between dedication to his profession and results versus his now burgeoning father-tendencies is what makes this show, and I'm sure this will also include Yor whom he will start to care for as a wife and mother in due time while blissfully unaware of her actual profession.   Yor is definitely the dumbest of the trio, but I believe this makes sense, as it's likely her past is very tragic and much similar to Anya's where she's been bred since childhood to be an efficient killing machine, and thus so long as she serves that role, nobody cares that she is ignorant and awkward in real life, and in fact, this likely deliberately helps her  maintain her cover as nobody would suspect the nitwit of being a proficient assassin so their guards are habitually let down around her and they also look down on her for it. Her mix of beauty and dimwittery are useful for getting salicious male targets to approach her.   I'm already a fan, and there's quite a bit of buzz around this due to the source material, so this looks like it's going to be a great time!

It is kind of funny how Takuya Eguchi and Saori Hayami are paired again but they still have amazing chemistry.    Loid is the stoic and driven super-spy who has no time for a family but a secret heart of gold that cares for others that places him on his mission and draws him to his fake family.   Anya is as adorable as ever and her telepathy is comedy gold, and she has the best reaction faces in anime form. She's never truly had a family but now she has a shot at one and loves how crazy it all is.    Yor is a classic Hayamin character who is a lethal, yet slightly ditzy, raven-haired beauty who can fight, kill, and sneak up on someone in heels. She's cute, a little too straightforward for her own good, but it plays off Loid and others quite well. Now hopefully her co-workers finally get off her back.    And just like Anya who saw how exciting it would be for a spy and an assassin to end up together (with a grenade proposal/marriage to boot), I can't wait to see this family come together! And the Opening really captures their vibe perfectly.

With how extremely gullible she seems to be and the general... spacey oblivious vibe she gives off I'm finding it hard to buy her as an assassin.   That is to say, she's clearly very VERY capable, but as someone who was trained as a child and has been doing this well into her 20s how has she not been caught and/or not gotten more perceptive over the years? Obviously the show is a comedy and there's some suspension of disbelief here, but if someone believes that chucking a steel pipe at at man with a gun is ""The latest therapy for my patient who's having an episode"" than one would think she might not have the most success at keeping her top secret job secret.

The basic deal with Spy x Family as a comedy is everyone is kind of a huge dumbass, as is the case with most comedies. Loid's a lot better at hiding it since he's more booksmart and adaptable because that's his job, but I don't think people comment enough on the fact that he's a dingus in his own right, especially when it comes to common sense. None of Yor's actions twigged his suspicions either (though she at least came up with slightly better excuses than he did). He's so used to operating in a world of spies he doesn't seem to have a good idea of how a normal person would react to danger (a lot less calmly than Yor), and that's the comedy. It's meant to be absurd.   For Yor, the concept is that she's spent so much of her life focused becoming the best at murder she doesn't have many life skills outside of that and honestly, she isn't great at hiding her 'true job', but everyone around her is also a loopy space case so that's okay.

I really wish episode 2 had severely curtail the bitchy office lady and party scene so that we could have had more Anya scene instead, I ended up skimming toward the end. Or at the very least bring Anya in and have her read the bitchy OL mind instead of having them talk behind Yor back in front of her.

It is kind of funny how Takuya Eguchi and Saori Hayami are paired again but they still have amazing chemistry.    Loid is the stoic and driven super-spy who has no time for a family but a secret heart of gold that cares for others that places him on his mission and draws him to his fake family.   Anya is as adorable as ever and her telepathy is comedy gold, and she has the best reaction faces in anime form. She's never truly had a family but now she has a shot at one and loves how crazy it all is.    Yor is a classic Hayamin character who is a lethal, yet slightly ditzy, raven-haired beauty who can fight, kill, and sneak up on someone in heels. She's cute, a little too straightforward for her own good, but it plays off Loid and others quite well. Now hopefully her co-workers finally get off her back.    And just like Anya who saw how exciting it would be for a spy and an assassin to end up together (with a grenade proposal/marriage to boot), I can't wait to see this family come together! And the Opening really captures their vibe perfectly.

With how extremely gullible she seems to be and the general... spacey oblivious vibe she gives off I'm finding it hard to buy her as an assassin.   That is to say, she's clearly very VERY capable, but as someone who was trained as a child and has been doing this well into her 20s how has she not been caught and/or not gotten more perceptive over the years? Obviously the show is a comedy and there's some suspension of disbelief here, but if someone believes that chucking a steel pipe at at man with a gun is ""The latest therapy for my patient who's having an episode"" than one would think she might not have the most success at keeping her top secret job secret.

The basic deal with Spy x Family as a comedy is everyone is kind of a huge dumbass, as is the case with most comedies. Loid's a lot better at hiding it since he's more booksmart and adaptable because that's his job, but I don't think people comment enough on the fact that he's a dingus in his own right, especially when it comes to common sense. None of Yor's actions twigged his suspicions either (though she at least came up with slightly better excuses than he did). He's so used to operating in a world of spies he doesn't seem to have a good idea of how a normal person would react to danger (a lot less calmly than Yor), and that's the comedy. It's meant to be absurd.   For Yor, the concept is that she's spent so much of her life focused becoming the best at murder she doesn't have many life skills outside of that and honestly, she isn't great at hiding her 'true job', but everyone around her is also a loopy space case so that's okay.

I like the fact that despite giving her psychic abilities where most shows would try and make her more mature and smarter than the adults around her, instead the story has done the smart thing and given her the same mind, emotions and motivations of a naive child which is more believable, allows for more comedy and is also so totally precious and cute!   Loid is also perfect for what his role is. The tug of war between dedication to his profession and results versus his now burgeoning father-tendencies is what makes this show, and I'm sure this will also include Yor whom he will start to care for as a wife and mother in due time while blissfully unaware of her actual profession.   Yor is definitely the dumbest of the trio, but I believe this makes sense, as it's likely her past is very tragic and much similar to Anya's where she's been bred since childhood to be an efficient killing machine, and thus so long as she serves that role, nobody cares that she is ignorant and awkward in real life, and in fact, this likely deliberately helps her  maintain her cover as nobody would suspect the nitwit of being a proficient assassin so their guards are habitually let down around her and they also look down on her for it. Her mix of beauty and dimwittery are useful for getting salicious male targets to approach her.   I'm already a fan, and there's quite a bit of buzz around this due to the source material, so this looks like it's going to be a great time!

I really wish episode 2 had severely curtail the bitchy office lady and party scene so that we could have had more Anya scene instead, I ended up skimming toward the end. Or at the very least bring Anya in and have her read the bitchy OL mind instead of having them talk behind Yor back in front of her.

It is kind of funny how Takuya Eguchi and Saori Hayami are paired again but they still have amazing chemistry.    Loid is the stoic and driven super-spy who has no time for a family but a secret heart of gold that cares for others that places him on his mission and draws him to his fake family.   Anya is as adorable as ever and her telepathy is comedy gold, and she has the best reaction faces in anime form. She's never truly had a family but now she has a shot at one and loves how crazy it all is.    Yor is a classic Hayamin character who is a lethal, yet slightly ditzy, raven-haired beauty who can fight, kill, and sneak up on someone in heels. She's cute, a little too straightforward for her own good, but it plays off Loid and others quite well. Now hopefully her co-workers finally get off her back.    And just like Anya who saw how exciting it would be for a spy and an assassin to end up together (with a grenade proposal/marriage to boot), I can't wait to see this family come together! And the Opening really captures their vibe perfectly.

With how extremely gullible she seems to be and the general... spacey oblivious vibe she gives off I'm finding it hard to buy her as an assassin.   That is to say, she's clearly very VERY capable, but as someone who was trained as a child and has been doing this well into her 20s how has she not been caught and/or not gotten more perceptive over the years? Obviously the show is a comedy and there's some suspension of disbelief here, but if someone believes that chucking a steel pipe at at man with a gun is ""The latest therapy for my patient who's having an episode"" than one would think she might not have the most success at keeping her top secret job secret.

The basic deal with Spy x Family as a comedy is everyone is kind of a huge dumbass, as is the case with most comedies. Loid's a lot better at hiding it since he's more booksmart and adaptable because that's his job, but I don't think people comment enough on the fact that he's a dingus in his own right, especially when it comes to common sense. None of Yor's actions twigged his suspicions either (though she at least came up with slightly better excuses than he did). He's so used to operating in a world of spies he doesn't seem to have a good idea of how a normal person would react to danger (a lot less calmly than Yor), and that's the comedy. It's meant to be absurd.   For Yor, the concept is that she's spent so much of her life focused becoming the best at murder she doesn't have many life skills outside of that and honestly, she isn't great at hiding her 'true job', but everyone around her is also a loopy space case so that's okay.

I like the fact that despite giving her psychic abilities where most shows would try and make her more mature and smarter than the adults around her, instead the story has done the smart thing and given her the same mind, emotions and motivations of a naive child which is more believable, allows for more comedy and is also so totally precious and cute!   Loid is also perfect for what his role is. The tug of war between dedication to his profession and results versus his now burgeoning father-tendencies is what makes this show, and I'm sure this will also include Yor whom he will start to care for as a wife and mother in due time while blissfully unaware of her actual profession.   Yor is definitely the dumbest of the trio, but I believe this makes sense, as it's likely her past is very tragic and much similar to Anya's where she's been bred since childhood to be an efficient killing machine, and thus so long as she serves that role, nobody cares that she is ignorant and awkward in real life, and in fact, this likely deliberately helps her  maintain her cover as nobody would suspect the nitwit of being a proficient assassin so their guards are habitually let down around her and they also look down on her for it. Her mix of beauty and dimwittery are useful for getting salicious male targets to approach her.   I'm already a fan, and there's quite a bit of buzz around this due to the source material, so this looks like it's going to be a great time!

Yor is definitely the dumbest of the trio, but I believe this makes sense, as it's likely her past is very tragic and much similar to Anya's where she's been bred since childhood to be an efficient killing machine, and thus so long as she serves that role, nobody cares that she is ignorant and awkward in real life, and in fact, this likely deliberately helps her  maintain her cover as nobody would suspect the nitwit of being a proficient assassin so their guards are habitually let down around her and they also look down on her for it. Her mix of beauty and dimwittery are useful for getting salicious male targets to approach her.   I'm already a fan, and there's quite a bit of buzz around this due to the source material, so this looks like it's going to be a great time!

REVIEW: Spy×Family [1/3] - Forum - Anime News Network:SEA," SO I showed this to my parents and some others and they absolutely loved it.    It somehow rides that line of absured/ fantasy enough while being grounded and relatable to most peoples experiences. Honestly if there was an MCU type anime, I really think that this would be it.  It is still anime but it is very very approchable and inviting to non anime fans  ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://www.phpbb.com/': 1}"

27-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/cms/discuss/184942,EP. REVIEW: Spy×Family [1/3] - Forum - Anime News Network:SEA," So far I think they're doing an amazing job of adapting the manga and characters from a direction, VA, animation, and execution level.    It is kind of funny how Takuya Eguchi and Saori Hayami are paired again but they still have amazing chemistry.    Loid is the stoic and driven super-spy who has no time for a family but a secret heart of gold that cares for others that places him on his mission and draws him to his fake family.   Anya is as adorable as ever and her telepathy is comedy gold, and she has the best reaction faces in anime form. She's never truly had a family but now she has a shot at one and loves how crazy it all is.    Yor is a classic Hayamin character who is a lethal, yet slightly ditzy, raven-haired beauty who can fight, kill, and sneak up on someone in heels. She's cute, a little too straightforward for her own good, but it plays off Loid and others quite well. Now hopefully her co-workers finally get off her back.    And just like Anya who saw how exciting it would be for a spy and an assassin to end up together (with a grenade proposal/marriage to boot), I can't wait to see this family come together! And the Opening really captures their vibe perfectly.

News Chi -Chikyū no Undō ni Tsuite- Manga, Natsuko Taniguchi Win Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prizes   posted on 2022-04-25 10:45 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Izumi Okaya also wins short work prize for 2 manga    The Asahi Shimbun paper announced the winners for the 26th Annual Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize awards on Monday. The awards commemorate the contributions of the manga pioneer Osamu Tezuka (Astro Boy/Mighty Atom, Kimba the White Lion/Jungle Emperor, Phoenix, Black Jack) by recognizing the manga that best follow his tradition.   Grand Prize  Chi -Chikyū no Undō ni Tsuite- (Chi - On the Movements of the Earth) Uoto Shogakukan (Big Comic Spirits, 2020-April 25, 2022) Sparks of the discoveries of the Renaissance are only beginning to burn in 15th century Europe, even as those who make discoveries are burned for their heresy. In Poland, a child prodigy named Rafal is expected to be another great mind in theology, but an encounter with a certain man leads him down the path to a heretical truth.   New Creator Prize  Kyōshitsu no Katasumi de Seishun wa Hajimaru (Youth Begins in a Corner of the Classroom) and Konya Sukiyaki da yo (It's Sukiyaki for Tonight) Natsuko Taniguchi Kyōshitsu no Katasumi de Seishun wa Hajimaru: Kadokawa (Monthly Comic Beam, 2020-2021) Konya Sukiyaki da yo: Shinchosha (Kurage Bunch, April-July 2021) Kyōshitsu no Katasumi de Seishun wa Hajimaru is an omnibus collection centering on youth stories. One  of the stories involves Mari Yoshida, a girl that only becomes the main character for a brief moment, before situations go sideways and she becomes cringe. Meanwhile, the alien Nell has held a dream of wanting to do something on Earth. Also in the classroom are people wanting to hide their otakudom, people who act out their ideal life on social media, and people who have confidence in their special destiny. Every kid in the classroom has their own secret, and you can't even claim to understand the kid right next to you.    Konya Sukiyaki da yo centers on two women in their 30s. Aiko is a freelance interior designer who wants to marry her current boyfriend, but envisions herself as far from the ideal wife, due to her being bad at household chores. Meanwhile, Tomoko is a picture book illustrator that is good at housework, but societal notions of marriage and romance don't hit home for her. They mutually decide that, until they find their perfect marriage partner, that they should get married with each other.  Short Work Prize  Ii Toshi o (Have a Good Year) and Hakumokuren wa Kirei ni Chiranai (White Magnolias Do Not Fall Beautifully) Izumi Okaya Ii Toshi o: Kadokawa Hakumokuren wa Kirei ni Chiranai: Shogakukan Ii Toshi o is set during the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, and centers on 42-year-old Toshio Haida, a person who lives alone and was formerly married. He uses the occasion of his mother's passing to move back in with his 72-year-old father in Tokyo. When he finds the 5 million yen that his mother left him, he wonders what to do with it.    Hakumokuren wa Kirei ni Chiranai centers on three friends since high school, all born in 1963: Housewife Mari, who actually secretly hates cooking and cleaning and doing the laundry; Sayo, a woman in the middle of a divorce, and who has not seen the need to take care of herself even now; and Satoe, a career-minded woman who questions the pressure to have children after marriage. The three meet each other again when their former high school classmate Hiromi dies alone in the apartment she owned, the Hakurensō. For some reason, Hiromi named all three of them in her will, even though they were never close to her.    Chi -Chikyū no Undō ni Tsuite- creator Uoto is the youngest ever to win the Grand Prize at 24 years old. The manga also ended on Monday, with the manga's eighth and final compiled book volume shipping on June 30.    Asahi Shimbun had scheduled an awards ceremony in Tokyo on June 2,. The Grand Prize winner will receive a bronze statue and 2 million yen (about US$19,000), while the other winners will each receive a bronze statue and 1 million yen (about US$9,000).    This year's judging committee – manga creator Osamu Akimoto, manga creator Machiko Satonaka, entertainer Minami Takahashi, writer and Tohoku University of Art and Design instructor Yukiko Tomiyama, professor and scholar Shōhei Chūjō, manga critic Nobunaga Minami, and comedian and manga creator Taro Yabe  – selected the nominees from titles recommended by specialists and bookstore employees. To be eligible, the manga had to have had a compiled volume published in 2021.    Last year, nine titles were nominated (including Peleliu: Guernica of Paradise), and Kazumi Yamashita's Land won the Grand Prize. Kanehito Yamada and Tsukasa Abe's Frieren: Beyond Journey's End  won the New Creator prize, and Hiroko Nobara's Kieta Mama Tomo and Tsuma wa Kuchi o Kiite Kuremasen won the Short Work Prize. The committee also awarded the Special Prize to Koyoharu Gotouge's Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba manga.

New Creator Prize  Kyōshitsu no Katasumi de Seishun wa Hajimaru (Youth Begins in a Corner of the Classroom) and Konya Sukiyaki da yo (It's Sukiyaki for Tonight) Natsuko Taniguchi Kyōshitsu no Katasumi de Seishun wa Hajimaru: Kadokawa (Monthly Comic Beam, 2020-2021) Konya Sukiyaki da yo: Shinchosha (Kurage Bunch, April-July 2021) Kyōshitsu no Katasumi de Seishun wa Hajimaru is an omnibus collection centering on youth stories. One  of the stories involves Mari Yoshida, a girl that only becomes the main character for a brief moment, before situations go sideways and she becomes cringe. Meanwhile, the alien Nell has held a dream of wanting to do something on Earth. Also in the classroom are people wanting to hide their otakudom, people who act out their ideal life on social media, and people who have confidence in their special destiny. Every kid in the classroom has their own secret, and you can't even claim to understand the kid right next to you.    Konya Sukiyaki da yo centers on two women in their 30s. Aiko is a freelance interior designer who wants to marry her current boyfriend, but envisions herself as far from the ideal wife, due to her being bad at household chores. Meanwhile, Tomoko is a picture book illustrator that is good at housework, but societal notions of marriage and romance don't hit home for her. They mutually decide that, until they find their perfect marriage partner, that they should get married with each other.

He uses the occasion of his mother's passing to move back in with his 72-year-old father in Tokyo. When he finds the 5 million yen that his mother left him, he wonders what to do with it.    Hakumokuren wa Kirei ni Chiranai centers on three friends since high school, all born in 1963: Housewife Mari, who actually secretly hates cooking and cleaning and doing the laundry; Sayo, a woman in the middle of a divorce, and who has not seen the need to take care of herself even now; and Satoe, a career-minded woman who questions the pressure to have children after marriage. The three meet each other again when their former high school classmate Hiromi dies alone in the apartment she owned, the Hakurensō. For some reason, Hiromi named all three of them in her will, even though they were never close to her.

News Chi -Chikyū no Undō ni Tsuite- Manga, Natsuko Taniguchi Win Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prizes   posted on 2022-04-25 10:45 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Izumi Okaya also wins short work prize for 2 manga    The Asahi Shimbun paper announced the winners for the 26th Annual Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize awards on Monday. The awards commemorate the contributions of the manga pioneer Osamu Tezuka (Astro Boy/Mighty Atom, Kimba the White Lion/Jungle Emperor, Phoenix, Black Jack) by recognizing the manga that best follow his tradition.   Grand Prize  Chi -Chikyū no Undō ni Tsuite- (Chi - On the Movements of the Earth) Uoto Shogakukan (Big Comic Spirits, 2020-April 25, 2022) Sparks of the discoveries of the Renaissance are only beginning to burn in 15th century Europe, even as those who make discoveries are burned for their heresy. In Poland, a child prodigy named Rafal is expected to be another great mind in theology, but an encounter with a certain man leads him down the path to a heretical truth.   New Creator Prize  Kyōshitsu no Katasumi de Seishun wa Hajimaru (Youth Begins in a Corner of the Classroom) and Konya Sukiyaki da yo (It's Sukiyaki for Tonight) Natsuko Taniguchi Kyōshitsu no Katasumi de Seishun wa Hajimaru: Kadokawa (Monthly Comic Beam, 2020-2021) Konya Sukiyaki da yo: Shinchosha (Kurage Bunch, April-July 2021) Kyōshitsu no Katasumi de Seishun wa Hajimaru is an omnibus collection centering on youth stories. One  of the stories involves Mari Yoshida, a girl that only becomes the main character for a brief moment, before situations go sideways and she becomes cringe. Meanwhile, the alien Nell has held a dream of wanting to do something on Earth. Also in the classroom are people wanting to hide their otakudom, people who act out their ideal life on social media, and people who have confidence in their special destiny. Every kid in the classroom has their own secret, and you can't even claim to understand the kid right next to you.    Konya Sukiyaki da yo centers on two women in their 30s. Aiko is a freelance interior designer who wants to marry her current boyfriend, but envisions herself as far from the ideal wife, due to her being bad at household chores. Meanwhile, Tomoko is a picture book illustrator that is good at housework, but societal notions of marriage and romance don't hit home for her. They mutually decide that, until they find their perfect marriage partner, that they should get married with each other.  Short Work Prize  Ii Toshi o (Have a Good Year) and Hakumokuren wa Kirei ni Chiranai (White Magnolias Do Not Fall Beautifully) Izumi Okaya Ii Toshi o: Kadokawa Hakumokuren wa Kirei ni Chiranai: Shogakukan Ii Toshi o is set during the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, and centers on 42-year-old Toshio Haida, a person who lives alone and was formerly married. He uses the occasion of his mother's passing to move back in with his 72-year-old father in Tokyo. When he finds the 5 million yen that his mother left him, he wonders what to do with it.    Hakumokuren wa Kirei ni Chiranai centers on three friends since high school, all born in 1963: Housewife Mari, who actually secretly hates cooking and cleaning and doing the laundry; Sayo, a woman in the middle of a divorce, and who has not seen the need to take care of herself even now; and Satoe, a career-minded woman who questions the pressure to have children after marriage. The three meet each other again when their former high school classmate Hiromi dies alone in the apartment she owned, the Hakurensō. For some reason, Hiromi named all three of them in her will, even though they were never close to her.    Chi -Chikyū no Undō ni Tsuite- creator Uoto is the youngest ever to win the Grand Prize at 24 years old. The manga also ended on Monday, with the manga's eighth and final compiled book volume shipping on June 30.    Asahi Shimbun had scheduled an awards ceremony in Tokyo on June 2,. The Grand Prize winner will receive a bronze statue and 2 million yen (about US$19,000), while the other winners will each receive a bronze statue and 1 million yen (about US$9,000).    This year's judging committee – manga creator Osamu Akimoto, manga creator Machiko Satonaka, entertainer Minami Takahashi, writer and Tohoku University of Art and Design instructor Yukiko Tomiyama, professor and scholar Shōhei Chūjō, manga critic Nobunaga Minami, and comedian and manga creator Taro Yabe  – selected the nominees from titles recommended by specialists and bookstore employees. To be eligible, the manga had to have had a compiled volume published in 2021.    Last year, nine titles were nominated (including Peleliu: Guernica of Paradise), and Kazumi Yamashita's Land won the Grand Prize.
