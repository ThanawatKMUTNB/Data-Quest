I hope that means they adapt the game well. From what I've heard they kind of rushed the 2nd half of the prior anime, to it's detriment.

Good the more episodes it gets the better the adaptation in pace even if it is just a little.   Hard to believe the adaptation of the first game was released all the way back in 2006. and now 16 years later the trilogy can now be fully adapted and concluded. Looking forward to it.

Her voice always makes me think of Utawarerumono         Like there is supposed to be any other choice - Suara songs are an unchangeable part of the Utawarerumono franchise since 2006, so it's hard to think of someone other to fit in.

The 2006 Utawarerumono anime was entertaining, had good characters, and the story kept my attention.  Utawarerumono: False Faces was dull, the plot meandered without any seeming goal, and I found the characters boring, especially the lead.    Was this a result of the first veering away from the game and the 2nd sticking closer to it?    Or was it a path they picked to follow in FF?   So to sum up, I hope Mask of Truth is better than False Faces.

It's other way around - even with Mask of Deception being most likely the weakest of the trilogy, the anime actually cut down a couple of important plot arcs from the game, put a lot of changes that probably will affect the story of MoT anime too - and put too much on the SoL aspect of the game, and 25 episodes were clearly not enough for the ~50-hour VN - while first anime adapted the most of the first game just because it was the shortest of them all.

I would say that it's difficult to determine, in regards to Sonic's video game presence it could be argued that Sonic Mania brought back the character to the gaming world after the disaster that was Sonic Boom, but due to Forces and Colors Ultimate general bad reception amongst gamers I think his future in gaming is still up in the air unless Frontiers exceeds all expectations.  In terms of Sonic's popularity outside the videogame realm I'd say that we're truly living a renaissance. As opposed to the games' reception Boom's cartoon was enjoyable, Sonic made some fun cameos in Wreck-it-Ralph 1 and 2, he got a special appearance in OK K.O, the new Sonic comic seems to be doing great, there's that Netflix show in development, and Sonic's movie has become a franchise at Paramount.  I think it could be argued that Sonic has become more of multimedia IP and not just a videogame icon, kids these days are probably more familiar with Sonic by his appearances in other media than his own videogames, I mean I have two nephews that love Sonic but never played any of his games, I tried making them play the original Genesis game but they couldn't pass the first enemy      Back to top                  Mr. sickVisionz    Joined: 28 Oct 2007 		    Posts: 2124       Posted: Mon Apr 25, 2022 8:09 pm              Quote:    Ben Schwartz (DuckTales, Parks and Recreation) voiced the title character Sonic in the original film.

I would say that it's difficult to determine, in regards to Sonic's video game presence it could be argued that Sonic Mania brought back the character to the gaming world after the disaster that was Sonic Boom, but due to Forces and Colors Ultimate general bad reception amongst gamers I think his future in gaming is still up in the air unless Frontiers exceeds all expectations.  In terms of Sonic's popularity outside the videogame realm I'd say that we're truly living a renaissance. As opposed to the games' reception Boom's cartoon was enjoyable, Sonic made some fun cameos in Wreck-it-Ralph 1 and 2, he got a special appearance in OK K.O, the new Sonic comic seems to be doing great, there's that Netflix show in development, and Sonic's movie has become a franchise at Paramount.  I think it could be argued that Sonic has become more of multimedia IP and not just a videogame icon, kids these days are probably more familiar with Sonic by his appearances in other media than his own videogames, I mean I have two nephews that love Sonic but never played any of his games, I tried making them play the original Genesis game but they couldn't pass the first enemy      Back to top                  Mr. sickVisionz    Joined: 28 Oct 2007 		    Posts: 2124       Posted: Mon Apr 25, 2022 8:09 pm              Quote:    Ben Schwartz (DuckTales, Parks and Recreation) voiced the title character Sonic in the original film.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Healer Girl   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Healer Girl ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Those that use ""voice medicine,"" the ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses with song, are called ""healers."" There are three apprentice healers working at the Karasuma Voice Treatment Center. Kana Fujii, an energetic girl who sets the tone, the strong-willed lady Reimi Itsushiro, and Hibiki Morishima who is caring but firm. These three first year high school girls are training after school to become full-fledged Healers. With the addition of Sonia Yanagi, a returnee who is a certified C-level healer, the girls are singing songs of healing as they work towards their dreams.    Healer Girl is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While the first episode of Healer Girl is an enjoyable enough introduction to our typical cute girl trio—i.e., the well-intentioned screw-up, the calm one, and the overly serious one—what really captured my attention was the world they exist in. Healer Girl is a world in which singing is an accepted form of medical treatment with results on par with Western medicine. This is a fun idea—it's basically a form of magic being incorporated into everyday society. More interesting still is that natural talent is apparently a prerequisite for healing through singing—though even recordings of these healers will give at least some relief. As a person who loves hard magic systems (i.e., magic systems with concrete rules on how and why they work the way they do), it was a blast to learn about the girls' singing powers.    At the same time, however, the central conflict of the episode doesn't make sense. The show is structured around the conceit that magical singers are basically doctors. As such, they can't heal without a license. But why? The reason doctors need licenses is that, when dealing with invasive medical procedures or dangerous medications, an ignorant person could do far more harm than good.  But can a magical song hurt a patient? We see no sign of this as, according to the character dialogue, the only downside of poor singing is that it makes the treatment less effective.    I'm guessing that what Kana did in the climax counts as first aid rather than healing, but it made me wonder where exactly the line is. (It also made me wonder if a normal first aid kit in this world comes with a non-prescription MP3 player to help in emergencies.)    If it comes off like I dislike the show, let me assure you that I'm not. It's the opposite, actually.  I enjoyed the show so much that I am invested in the world it is trying to build—that is why these issues stand out. I want this world to feel as real as possible.    And as for the music, while I wouldn't call the songs bangers, they were decent enough. But what I absolutely loved more than the songs themselves was the extensive use of diegetic music. When the girls break into song in public, they are actually singing and the people around them act accordingly. And, due to their profession, their constant singing makes total sense. (As a onetime musical theater/choir kid, let me tell you, randomly singing at your friends is actually rather normal.) It adds yet another layer to the world-building and makes it feel even more, well, real. And while it has some plot holes that need filling, it's a world I am loving spending time in.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               Oh wow, a musical anime! I hope it'll be just like my favorite anime, Lost Song!    Just kidding. Lost Song has never been and never will be anyone's favorite anime. Healer Girl, on the other hand, stands a pretty chance of becoming beloved by at least some and, if it keeps on track, maybe even many. This sweet little musical series, with its bright, colorful aesthetic and strong direction with dynamic camera work by industry veteran Yasuhiro Irie, has presented a strong premiere, even if it's not totally my thing.    While I wasn't particularly drawn in by the character writing – Karin is a pretty typical overenthusiastic but gifted newbie with her two best friends to corral her – the world fascinated me. Musical healing exists right alongside Eastern and Western medicine, and is presented as empirically effective. A kid has a scraped knee, Karin sings to him, his knee heals, all is well. Not a lot of room for skepticism there. I have so many questions, but in a good, “I'm curious about this worldbuilding” way rather than the way of “this makes no sense if you think about it for ten seconds.” Why would people choose the more invasive forms of medicine over musical healing? Clearly this form of medicine has its limits, since their instructor sent their client, an old woman with respiratory problems, to a hospital. What are they? Is there an in-universe reason for why all the healers are girls?    My biggest issue lies in the music. Plainly put, it's bland. It's like the most boring, forgettable Disney soundtrack ever conceived, and I'm not convinced that it can carry the show. Oh sure, the number where the girls start singing to each other about why they want to become healers is kind of fun, but it's unfocused and there doesn't seem to be much reason for it to be a song. It's more like an opera's libretto than anything you'd find in the standard structure of a musical.    Still, I doubt that'll be enough to put off most of the people who will be drawn in by this.        James Beckett  Rating:               I freaking love musicals. One of my longtime dreams has been to see a studio produce a big-budget, no- holds-barred Broadway-style musical. I'm not talking about an idol series or a show about a rock band, or an episode of a slice-of-life anime where the kids put on a concert for their culture festival. I'm talking about the pure, undiluted cheese that comes from regular characters interrupting the story to break out into perfectly choreographed dance numbers, belt their hearts out, and then move on as if nothing completely insane has just happened. Does anyone here remember Galavant? That show rules. I basically want an anime Galavant.    Healer Girl is not anime Galavant, sadly, but it's the closest we've gotten to the dream, gosh darn it, and it made me extremely happy anyways. Our main trio are all well-drawn, both literally and as likable character archetypes, and they all possess the nearly unbearable levels of sincerity it takes to make it as the leads of a musical, not to mention some incredibly toned diaphragms, and the whole “Being able to magically heal the wounds of the sick with nothing but the power of music” thing. The show looks good, it's cute and charming when it needs to be, and most importantly, it's got the tunes it needs to back up its premise.    Now, if I'm being honest, the style of singing we get in this premiere is just a bit treacly for my taste, and I was a little put off by some of the strange mixing choices—not only are the girls' voices auto-tuned to heck and back, but the universe provides a somewhat tinny and perfectly synched backing soundtrack whenever Kana and her friends open their mouths. In short, it both looks and sounds less like the characters are themselves singing, and more like they're all lip-syncing to some poorly mixed audio already in progress. And yes, I know that technically I'm just defining how voice-over works in animation, but I'm talking about the effect of the production. It often doesn't quite feel like the music and the characters are operating on the same aural plane of existence, if that makes any sense.    Still, I won't complain too much, because it was very fun to watch the girls get to know each other and show off their vocal skills, and some of the banter we get is the closest that I've ever seen an anime get to a Broadway styled patter song. Plus, we get to spend a half-hour in a world where, when a little kid's grandmother collapses on the floor, she really can be saved with the power of a good show tune. That's the kind of world I want to live in, if only in weekly chunks of about twenty-three minutes each. Healer Girl may not be quite the full-scale song-and-dance production that I've been waiting for, but it's a damned good time for anyone that needs an extra dose of musical healing this season.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We get a lot of music-related anime – mostly idol shows – but it's exceedingly rare that we get a full-on West Side Story-style Capital-M Musical anime. While Healer Girl doesn't go all the way into that territory, it gets pretty darn close, and the result is a vibrant and earnest little treat. You're just going to need a stomach for unerringly saccharine sentimentality to get through it.    Make no mistake: if you're the kind of person who starts to grimace when characters snap their gaze into the middle distance and start singing their feelings, you will find nothing but pain here. Healer Girl is such a bubbly show in tone, aesthetic, and presentation, that it has no place for a concept so cynical as cringe. It's dancing forward down the street, humming a pop ballad too loudly with its airpods on full blast, and you can either trot along to its tune or hastily cross the street to avoid it.    Me, I love musicals, even if this show's audio sensibilities aren't really my jam. But that's more than made up for by the wonderful, colorful, constantly expressive animation that brings these characters and their songs to life. The way each of them moves, especially in their flowy “Healer” robes, is just a delight to take in. The characters themselves are likable enough, though not particularly deep or novel. But the way they're characterized through movement, how they physically interact with each other and the world around them, is just so charming that it overrides any writing deficiencies.    And because there's not a speck of cynicism in Healer Girl's body, that all manages to make Kana and her friends really fun to just watch, whether they're healing the sick or goofing around to avoid filling out paperwork. My favorite scene is easily the one where Kana asks her fellow apprentices why they chose to be Healers, and they all start spontaneously singing their motivations. It's campy, silly, and caps off with Hibiki getting so caught up in singing about her admiration for their teacher that nothing can stop her. It takes what could be a by-the-books bit of character exposition and turns it into something with way more personality, and if the rest of the show can add touches like that, I think this will turn out to be a wonderful little show.    There are most certainly people who will be put off by the chord this show is striking, and I totally get that. Healer Girl is prancing right on the line between earnest iyashikei and irritating pabulum, and no amount of stellar production is going to make you like something you find annoyingly pwecious. But at least for this first episode, I'm happy to sing along with this sugary sweet bubblegum bop.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's not exactly a secret that singing can sometimes help to calm you down or otherwise affect your mood, and I'm not just saying that because my mother took The King and I's advice about whistling a happy tune to forget you're afraid pretty literally. (Because who doesn't want terrible musical accompaniment on a harrowing boat trip?) Healer Girl may be taking the concept a bit too far, though, with its fancy third branch of medicine and an apprenticeship program to train girls into fully-fledged musical healers. Do male voices not work as well? Are there no accredited musical medical schools? Who knows? It's a musical, pesky things like serious questions aren't necessary here.    And this really is a fairly classic musical. While there's singing to heal a variety of ailments, we also have a couple of instances where people just burst into song to explain things like why they got into musical healing in the first place, and before we know what's going on in that opening scene, Kana walking down the street singing at full blast and the stunned facial expressions of the folks on the street certainly looks like something straight out of a self-aware musical. Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.     discuss this in the forum (309 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Healer Girl   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Healer Girl ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Those that use ""voice medicine,"" the ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses with song, are called ""healers."" There are three apprentice healers working at the Karasuma Voice Treatment Center. Kana Fujii, an energetic girl who sets the tone, the strong-willed lady Reimi Itsushiro, and Hibiki Morishima who is caring but firm. These three first year high school girls are training after school to become full-fledged Healers. With the addition of Sonia Yanagi, a returnee who is a certified C-level healer, the girls are singing songs of healing as they work towards their dreams.    Healer Girl is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While the first episode of Healer Girl is an enjoyable enough introduction to our typical cute girl trio—i.e., the well-intentioned screw-up, the calm one, and the overly serious one—what really captured my attention was the world they exist in. Healer Girl is a world in which singing is an accepted form of medical treatment with results on par with Western medicine. This is a fun idea—it's basically a form of magic being incorporated into everyday society. More interesting still is that natural talent is apparently a prerequisite for healing through singing—though even recordings of these healers will give at least some relief. As a person who loves hard magic systems (i.e., magic systems with concrete rules on how and why they work the way they do), it was a blast to learn about the girls' singing powers.    At the same time, however, the central conflict of the episode doesn't make sense. The show is structured around the conceit that magical singers are basically doctors. As such, they can't heal without a license. But why? The reason doctors need licenses is that, when dealing with invasive medical procedures or dangerous medications, an ignorant person could do far more harm than good.  But can a magical song hurt a patient? We see no sign of this as, according to the character dialogue, the only downside of poor singing is that it makes the treatment less effective.    I'm guessing that what Kana did in the climax counts as first aid rather than healing, but it made me wonder where exactly the line is. (It also made me wonder if a normal first aid kit in this world comes with a non-prescription MP3 player to help in emergencies.)    If it comes off like I dislike the show, let me assure you that I'm not. It's the opposite, actually.  I enjoyed the show so much that I am invested in the world it is trying to build—that is why these issues stand out. I want this world to feel as real as possible.    And as for the music, while I wouldn't call the songs bangers, they were decent enough. But what I absolutely loved more than the songs themselves was the extensive use of diegetic music. When the girls break into song in public, they are actually singing and the people around them act accordingly. And, due to their profession, their constant singing makes total sense. (As a onetime musical theater/choir kid, let me tell you, randomly singing at your friends is actually rather normal.) It adds yet another layer to the world-building and makes it feel even more, well, real. And while it has some plot holes that need filling, it's a world I am loving spending time in.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               Oh wow, a musical anime! I hope it'll be just like my favorite anime, Lost Song!    Just kidding. Lost Song has never been and never will be anyone's favorite anime. Healer Girl, on the other hand, stands a pretty chance of becoming beloved by at least some and, if it keeps on track, maybe even many. This sweet little musical series, with its bright, colorful aesthetic and strong direction with dynamic camera work by industry veteran Yasuhiro Irie, has presented a strong premiere, even if it's not totally my thing.    While I wasn't particularly drawn in by the character writing – Karin is a pretty typical overenthusiastic but gifted newbie with her two best friends to corral her – the world fascinated me. Musical healing exists right alongside Eastern and Western medicine, and is presented as empirically effective. A kid has a scraped knee, Karin sings to him, his knee heals, all is well. Not a lot of room for skepticism there. I have so many questions, but in a good, “I'm curious about this worldbuilding” way rather than the way of “this makes no sense if you think about it for ten seconds.” Why would people choose the more invasive forms of medicine over musical healing? Clearly this form of medicine has its limits, since their instructor sent their client, an old woman with respiratory problems, to a hospital. What are they? Is there an in-universe reason for why all the healers are girls?    My biggest issue lies in the music. Plainly put, it's bland. It's like the most boring, forgettable Disney soundtrack ever conceived, and I'm not convinced that it can carry the show. Oh sure, the number where the girls start singing to each other about why they want to become healers is kind of fun, but it's unfocused and there doesn't seem to be much reason for it to be a song. It's more like an opera's libretto than anything you'd find in the standard structure of a musical.    Still, I doubt that'll be enough to put off most of the people who will be drawn in by this.        James Beckett  Rating:               I freaking love musicals. One of my longtime dreams has been to see a studio produce a big-budget, no- holds-barred Broadway-style musical. I'm not talking about an idol series or a show about a rock band, or an episode of a slice-of-life anime where the kids put on a concert for their culture festival. I'm talking about the pure, undiluted cheese that comes from regular characters interrupting the story to break out into perfectly choreographed dance numbers, belt their hearts out, and then move on as if nothing completely insane has just happened. Does anyone here remember Galavant? That show rules. I basically want an anime Galavant.    Healer Girl is not anime Galavant, sadly, but it's the closest we've gotten to the dream, gosh darn it, and it made me extremely happy anyways. Our main trio are all well-drawn, both literally and as likable character archetypes, and they all possess the nearly unbearable levels of sincerity it takes to make it as the leads of a musical, not to mention some incredibly toned diaphragms, and the whole “Being able to magically heal the wounds of the sick with nothing but the power of music” thing. The show looks good, it's cute and charming when it needs to be, and most importantly, it's got the tunes it needs to back up its premise.    Now, if I'm being honest, the style of singing we get in this premiere is just a bit treacly for my taste, and I was a little put off by some of the strange mixing choices—not only are the girls' voices auto-tuned to heck and back, but the universe provides a somewhat tinny and perfectly synched backing soundtrack whenever Kana and her friends open their mouths. In short, it both looks and sounds less like the characters are themselves singing, and more like they're all lip-syncing to some poorly mixed audio already in progress. And yes, I know that technically I'm just defining how voice-over works in animation, but I'm talking about the effect of the production. It often doesn't quite feel like the music and the characters are operating on the same aural plane of existence, if that makes any sense.    Still, I won't complain too much, because it was very fun to watch the girls get to know each other and show off their vocal skills, and some of the banter we get is the closest that I've ever seen an anime get to a Broadway styled patter song. Plus, we get to spend a half-hour in a world where, when a little kid's grandmother collapses on the floor, she really can be saved with the power of a good show tune. That's the kind of world I want to live in, if only in weekly chunks of about twenty-three minutes each. Healer Girl may not be quite the full-scale song-and-dance production that I've been waiting for, but it's a damned good time for anyone that needs an extra dose of musical healing this season.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We get a lot of music-related anime – mostly idol shows – but it's exceedingly rare that we get a full-on West Side Story-style Capital-M Musical anime. While Healer Girl doesn't go all the way into that territory, it gets pretty darn close, and the result is a vibrant and earnest little treat. You're just going to need a stomach for unerringly saccharine sentimentality to get through it.    Make no mistake: if you're the kind of person who starts to grimace when characters snap their gaze into the middle distance and start singing their feelings, you will find nothing but pain here. Healer Girl is such a bubbly show in tone, aesthetic, and presentation, that it has no place for a concept so cynical as cringe. It's dancing forward down the street, humming a pop ballad too loudly with its airpods on full blast, and you can either trot along to its tune or hastily cross the street to avoid it.    Me, I love musicals, even if this show's audio sensibilities aren't really my jam. But that's more than made up for by the wonderful, colorful, constantly expressive animation that brings these characters and their songs to life. The way each of them moves, especially in their flowy “Healer” robes, is just a delight to take in. The characters themselves are likable enough, though not particularly deep or novel. But the way they're characterized through movement, how they physically interact with each other and the world around them, is just so charming that it overrides any writing deficiencies.    And because there's not a speck of cynicism in Healer Girl's body, that all manages to make Kana and her friends really fun to just watch, whether they're healing the sick or goofing around to avoid filling out paperwork. My favorite scene is easily the one where Kana asks her fellow apprentices why they chose to be Healers, and they all start spontaneously singing their motivations. It's campy, silly, and caps off with Hibiki getting so caught up in singing about her admiration for their teacher that nothing can stop her. It takes what could be a by-the-books bit of character exposition and turns it into something with way more personality, and if the rest of the show can add touches like that, I think this will turn out to be a wonderful little show.    There are most certainly people who will be put off by the chord this show is striking, and I totally get that. Healer Girl is prancing right on the line between earnest iyashikei and irritating pabulum, and no amount of stellar production is going to make you like something you find annoyingly pwecious. But at least for this first episode, I'm happy to sing along with this sugary sweet bubblegum bop.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's not exactly a secret that singing can sometimes help to calm you down or otherwise affect your mood, and I'm not just saying that because my mother took The King and I's advice about whistling a happy tune to forget you're afraid pretty literally. (Because who doesn't want terrible musical accompaniment on a harrowing boat trip?) Healer Girl may be taking the concept a bit too far, though, with its fancy third branch of medicine and an apprenticeship program to train girls into fully-fledged musical healers. Do male voices not work as well? Are there no accredited musical medical schools? Who knows? It's a musical, pesky things like serious questions aren't necessary here.    And this really is a fairly classic musical. While there's singing to heal a variety of ailments, we also have a couple of instances where people just burst into song to explain things like why they got into musical healing in the first place, and before we know what's going on in that opening scene, Kana walking down the street singing at full blast and the stunned facial expressions of the folks on the street certainly looks like something straight out of a self-aware musical. Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.     discuss this in the forum (309 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Healer Girl   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Healer Girl ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Those that use ""voice medicine,"" the ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses with song, are called ""healers."" There are three apprentice healers working at the Karasuma Voice Treatment Center. Kana Fujii, an energetic girl who sets the tone, the strong-willed lady Reimi Itsushiro, and Hibiki Morishima who is caring but firm. These three first year high school girls are training after school to become full-fledged Healers. With the addition of Sonia Yanagi, a returnee who is a certified C-level healer, the girls are singing songs of healing as they work towards their dreams.    Healer Girl is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While the first episode of Healer Girl is an enjoyable enough introduction to our typical cute girl trio—i.e., the well-intentioned screw-up, the calm one, and the overly serious one—what really captured my attention was the world they exist in. Healer Girl is a world in which singing is an accepted form of medical treatment with results on par with Western medicine. This is a fun idea—it's basically a form of magic being incorporated into everyday society. More interesting still is that natural talent is apparently a prerequisite for healing through singing—though even recordings of these healers will give at least some relief. As a person who loves hard magic systems (i.e., magic systems with concrete rules on how and why they work the way they do), it was a blast to learn about the girls' singing powers.    At the same time, however, the central conflict of the episode doesn't make sense. The show is structured around the conceit that magical singers are basically doctors. As such, they can't heal without a license. But why? The reason doctors need licenses is that, when dealing with invasive medical procedures or dangerous medications, an ignorant person could do far more harm than good.  But can a magical song hurt a patient? We see no sign of this as, according to the character dialogue, the only downside of poor singing is that it makes the treatment less effective.    I'm guessing that what Kana did in the climax counts as first aid rather than healing, but it made me wonder where exactly the line is. (It also made me wonder if a normal first aid kit in this world comes with a non-prescription MP3 player to help in emergencies.)    If it comes off like I dislike the show, let me assure you that I'm not. It's the opposite, actually.  I enjoyed the show so much that I am invested in the world it is trying to build—that is why these issues stand out. I want this world to feel as real as possible.    And as for the music, while I wouldn't call the songs bangers, they were decent enough. But what I absolutely loved more than the songs themselves was the extensive use of diegetic music. When the girls break into song in public, they are actually singing and the people around them act accordingly. And, due to their profession, their constant singing makes total sense. (As a onetime musical theater/choir kid, let me tell you, randomly singing at your friends is actually rather normal.) It adds yet another layer to the world-building and makes it feel even more, well, real. And while it has some plot holes that need filling, it's a world I am loving spending time in.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               Oh wow, a musical anime! I hope it'll be just like my favorite anime, Lost Song!    Just kidding. Lost Song has never been and never will be anyone's favorite anime. Healer Girl, on the other hand, stands a pretty chance of becoming beloved by at least some and, if it keeps on track, maybe even many. This sweet little musical series, with its bright, colorful aesthetic and strong direction with dynamic camera work by industry veteran Yasuhiro Irie, has presented a strong premiere, even if it's not totally my thing.    While I wasn't particularly drawn in by the character writing – Karin is a pretty typical overenthusiastic but gifted newbie with her two best friends to corral her – the world fascinated me. Musical healing exists right alongside Eastern and Western medicine, and is presented as empirically effective. A kid has a scraped knee, Karin sings to him, his knee heals, all is well. Not a lot of room for skepticism there. I have so many questions, but in a good, “I'm curious about this worldbuilding” way rather than the way of “this makes no sense if you think about it for ten seconds.” Why would people choose the more invasive forms of medicine over musical healing? Clearly this form of medicine has its limits, since their instructor sent their client, an old woman with respiratory problems, to a hospital. What are they? Is there an in-universe reason for why all the healers are girls?    My biggest issue lies in the music. Plainly put, it's bland. It's like the most boring, forgettable Disney soundtrack ever conceived, and I'm not convinced that it can carry the show. Oh sure, the number where the girls start singing to each other about why they want to become healers is kind of fun, but it's unfocused and there doesn't seem to be much reason for it to be a song. It's more like an opera's libretto than anything you'd find in the standard structure of a musical.    Still, I doubt that'll be enough to put off most of the people who will be drawn in by this.        James Beckett  Rating:               I freaking love musicals. One of my longtime dreams has been to see a studio produce a big-budget, no- holds-barred Broadway-style musical. I'm not talking about an idol series or a show about a rock band, or an episode of a slice-of-life anime where the kids put on a concert for their culture festival. I'm talking about the pure, undiluted cheese that comes from regular characters interrupting the story to break out into perfectly choreographed dance numbers, belt their hearts out, and then move on as if nothing completely insane has just happened. Does anyone here remember Galavant? That show rules. I basically want an anime Galavant.    Healer Girl is not anime Galavant, sadly, but it's the closest we've gotten to the dream, gosh darn it, and it made me extremely happy anyways. Our main trio are all well-drawn, both literally and as likable character archetypes, and they all possess the nearly unbearable levels of sincerity it takes to make it as the leads of a musical, not to mention some incredibly toned diaphragms, and the whole “Being able to magically heal the wounds of the sick with nothing but the power of music” thing. The show looks good, it's cute and charming when it needs to be, and most importantly, it's got the tunes it needs to back up its premise.    Now, if I'm being honest, the style of singing we get in this premiere is just a bit treacly for my taste, and I was a little put off by some of the strange mixing choices—not only are the girls' voices auto-tuned to heck and back, but the universe provides a somewhat tinny and perfectly synched backing soundtrack whenever Kana and her friends open their mouths. In short, it both looks and sounds less like the characters are themselves singing, and more like they're all lip-syncing to some poorly mixed audio already in progress. And yes, I know that technically I'm just defining how voice-over works in animation, but I'm talking about the effect of the production. It often doesn't quite feel like the music and the characters are operating on the same aural plane of existence, if that makes any sense.    Still, I won't complain too much, because it was very fun to watch the girls get to know each other and show off their vocal skills, and some of the banter we get is the closest that I've ever seen an anime get to a Broadway styled patter song. Plus, we get to spend a half-hour in a world where, when a little kid's grandmother collapses on the floor, she really can be saved with the power of a good show tune. That's the kind of world I want to live in, if only in weekly chunks of about twenty-three minutes each. Healer Girl may not be quite the full-scale song-and-dance production that I've been waiting for, but it's a damned good time for anyone that needs an extra dose of musical healing this season.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We get a lot of music-related anime – mostly idol shows – but it's exceedingly rare that we get a full-on West Side Story-style Capital-M Musical anime. While Healer Girl doesn't go all the way into that territory, it gets pretty darn close, and the result is a vibrant and earnest little treat. You're just going to need a stomach for unerringly saccharine sentimentality to get through it.    Make no mistake: if you're the kind of person who starts to grimace when characters snap their gaze into the middle distance and start singing their feelings, you will find nothing but pain here. Healer Girl is such a bubbly show in tone, aesthetic, and presentation, that it has no place for a concept so cynical as cringe. It's dancing forward down the street, humming a pop ballad too loudly with its airpods on full blast, and you can either trot along to its tune or hastily cross the street to avoid it.    Me, I love musicals, even if this show's audio sensibilities aren't really my jam. But that's more than made up for by the wonderful, colorful, constantly expressive animation that brings these characters and their songs to life. The way each of them moves, especially in their flowy “Healer” robes, is just a delight to take in. The characters themselves are likable enough, though not particularly deep or novel. But the way they're characterized through movement, how they physically interact with each other and the world around them, is just so charming that it overrides any writing deficiencies.    And because there's not a speck of cynicism in Healer Girl's body, that all manages to make Kana and her friends really fun to just watch, whether they're healing the sick or goofing around to avoid filling out paperwork. My favorite scene is easily the one where Kana asks her fellow apprentices why they chose to be Healers, and they all start spontaneously singing their motivations. It's campy, silly, and caps off with Hibiki getting so caught up in singing about her admiration for their teacher that nothing can stop her. It takes what could be a by-the-books bit of character exposition and turns it into something with way more personality, and if the rest of the show can add touches like that, I think this will turn out to be a wonderful little show.    There are most certainly people who will be put off by the chord this show is striking, and I totally get that. Healer Girl is prancing right on the line between earnest iyashikei and irritating pabulum, and no amount of stellar production is going to make you like something you find annoyingly pwecious. But at least for this first episode, I'm happy to sing along with this sugary sweet bubblegum bop.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's not exactly a secret that singing can sometimes help to calm you down or otherwise affect your mood, and I'm not just saying that because my mother took The King and I's advice about whistling a happy tune to forget you're afraid pretty literally. (Because who doesn't want terrible musical accompaniment on a harrowing boat trip?) Healer Girl may be taking the concept a bit too far, though, with its fancy third branch of medicine and an apprenticeship program to train girls into fully-fledged musical healers. Do male voices not work as well? Are there no accredited musical medical schools? Who knows? It's a musical, pesky things like serious questions aren't necessary here.    And this really is a fairly classic musical. While there's singing to heal a variety of ailments, we also have a couple of instances where people just burst into song to explain things like why they got into musical healing in the first place, and before we know what's going on in that opening scene, Kana walking down the street singing at full blast and the stunned facial expressions of the folks on the street certainly looks like something straight out of a self-aware musical. Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.     discuss this in the forum (309 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Healer Girl   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Healer Girl ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Those that use ""voice medicine,"" the ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses with song, are called ""healers."" There are three apprentice healers working at the Karasuma Voice Treatment Center. Kana Fujii, an energetic girl who sets the tone, the strong-willed lady Reimi Itsushiro, and Hibiki Morishima who is caring but firm. These three first year high school girls are training after school to become full-fledged Healers. With the addition of Sonia Yanagi, a returnee who is a certified C-level healer, the girls are singing songs of healing as they work towards their dreams.    Healer Girl is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While the first episode of Healer Girl is an enjoyable enough introduction to our typical cute girl trio—i.e., the well-intentioned screw-up, the calm one, and the overly serious one—what really captured my attention was the world they exist in. Healer Girl is a world in which singing is an accepted form of medical treatment with results on par with Western medicine. This is a fun idea—it's basically a form of magic being incorporated into everyday society. More interesting still is that natural talent is apparently a prerequisite for healing through singing—though even recordings of these healers will give at least some relief. As a person who loves hard magic systems (i.e., magic systems with concrete rules on how and why they work the way they do), it was a blast to learn about the girls' singing powers.    At the same time, however, the central conflict of the episode doesn't make sense. The show is structured around the conceit that magical singers are basically doctors. As such, they can't heal without a license. But why? The reason doctors need licenses is that, when dealing with invasive medical procedures or dangerous medications, an ignorant person could do far more harm than good.  But can a magical song hurt a patient? We see no sign of this as, according to the character dialogue, the only downside of poor singing is that it makes the treatment less effective.    I'm guessing that what Kana did in the climax counts as first aid rather than healing, but it made me wonder where exactly the line is. (It also made me wonder if a normal first aid kit in this world comes with a non-prescription MP3 player to help in emergencies.)    If it comes off like I dislike the show, let me assure you that I'm not. It's the opposite, actually.  I enjoyed the show so much that I am invested in the world it is trying to build—that is why these issues stand out. I want this world to feel as real as possible.    And as for the music, while I wouldn't call the songs bangers, they were decent enough. But what I absolutely loved more than the songs themselves was the extensive use of diegetic music. When the girls break into song in public, they are actually singing and the people around them act accordingly. And, due to their profession, their constant singing makes total sense.

Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.     discuss this in the forum (309 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Healer Girl   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Healer Girl ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Those that use ""voice medicine,"" the ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses with song, are called ""healers."" There are three apprentice healers working at the Karasuma Voice Treatment Center. Kana Fujii, an energetic girl who sets the tone, the strong-willed lady Reimi Itsushiro, and Hibiki Morishima who is caring but firm. These three first year high school girls are training after school to become full-fledged Healers. With the addition of Sonia Yanagi, a returnee who is a certified C-level healer, the girls are singing songs of healing as they work towards their dreams.    Healer Girl is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While the first episode of Healer Girl is an enjoyable enough introduction to our typical cute girl trio—i.e., the well-intentioned screw-up, the calm one, and the overly serious one—what really captured my attention was the world they exist in. Healer Girl is a world in which singing is an accepted form of medical treatment with results on par with Western medicine. This is a fun idea—it's basically a form of magic being incorporated into everyday society. More interesting still is that natural talent is apparently a prerequisite for healing through singing—though even recordings of these healers will give at least some relief. As a person who loves hard magic systems (i.e., magic systems with concrete rules on how and why they work the way they do), it was a blast to learn about the girls' singing powers.    At the same time, however, the central conflict of the episode doesn't make sense. The show is structured around the conceit that magical singers are basically doctors. As such, they can't heal without a license. But why? The reason doctors need licenses is that, when dealing with invasive medical procedures or dangerous medications, an ignorant person could do far more harm than good.  But can a magical song hurt a patient? We see no sign of this as, according to the character dialogue, the only downside of poor singing is that it makes the treatment less effective.    I'm guessing that what Kana did in the climax counts as first aid rather than healing, but it made me wonder where exactly the line is. (It also made me wonder if a normal first aid kit in this world comes with a non-prescription MP3 player to help in emergencies.)    If it comes off like I dislike the show, let me assure you that I'm not. It's the opposite, actually.  I enjoyed the show so much that I am invested in the world it is trying to build—that is why these issues stand out. I want this world to feel as real as possible.    And as for the music, while I wouldn't call the songs bangers, they were decent enough. But what I absolutely loved more than the songs themselves was the extensive use of diegetic music. When the girls break into song in public, they are actually singing and the people around them act accordingly. And, due to their profession, their constant singing makes total sense. (As a onetime musical theater/choir kid, let me tell you, randomly singing at your friends is actually rather normal.) It adds yet another layer to the world-building and makes it feel even more, well, real. And while it has some plot holes that need filling, it's a world I am loving spending time in.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               Oh wow, a musical anime! I hope it'll be just like my favorite anime, Lost Song!    Just kidding. Lost Song has never been and never will be anyone's favorite anime. Healer Girl, on the other hand, stands a pretty chance of becoming beloved by at least some and, if it keeps on track, maybe even many. This sweet little musical series, with its bright, colorful aesthetic and strong direction with dynamic camera work by industry veteran Yasuhiro Irie, has presented a strong premiere, even if it's not totally my thing.    While I wasn't particularly drawn in by the character writing – Karin is a pretty typical overenthusiastic but gifted newbie with her two best friends to corral her – the world fascinated me. Musical healing exists right alongside Eastern and Western medicine, and is presented as empirically effective. A kid has a scraped knee, Karin sings to him, his knee heals, all is well. Not a lot of room for skepticism there. I have so many questions, but in a good, “I'm curious about this worldbuilding” way rather than the way of “this makes no sense if you think about it for ten seconds.” Why would people choose the more invasive forms of medicine over musical healing? Clearly this form of medicine has its limits, since their instructor sent their client, an old woman with respiratory problems, to a hospital. What are they? Is there an in-universe reason for why all the healers are girls?    My biggest issue lies in the music. Plainly put, it's bland. It's like the most boring, forgettable Disney soundtrack ever conceived, and I'm not convinced that it can carry the show. Oh sure, the number where the girls start singing to each other about why they want to become healers is kind of fun, but it's unfocused and there doesn't seem to be much reason for it to be a song. It's more like an opera's libretto than anything you'd find in the standard structure of a musical.    Still, I doubt that'll be enough to put off most of the people who will be drawn in by this.        James Beckett  Rating:               I freaking love musicals. One of my longtime dreams has been to see a studio produce a big-budget, no- holds-barred Broadway-style musical. I'm not talking about an idol series or a show about a rock band, or an episode of a slice-of-life anime where the kids put on a concert for their culture festival. I'm talking about the pure, undiluted cheese that comes from regular characters interrupting the story to break out into perfectly choreographed dance numbers, belt their hearts out, and then move on as if nothing completely insane has just happened. Does anyone here remember Galavant? That show rules. I basically want an anime Galavant.    Healer Girl is not anime Galavant, sadly, but it's the closest we've gotten to the dream, gosh darn it, and it made me extremely happy anyways. Our main trio are all well-drawn, both literally and as likable character archetypes, and they all possess the nearly unbearable levels of sincerity it takes to make it as the leads of a musical, not to mention some incredibly toned diaphragms, and the whole “Being able to magically heal the wounds of the sick with nothing but the power of music” thing. The show looks good, it's cute and charming when it needs to be, and most importantly, it's got the tunes it needs to back up its premise.    Now, if I'm being honest, the style of singing we get in this premiere is just a bit treacly for my taste, and I was a little put off by some of the strange mixing choices—not only are the girls' voices auto-tuned to heck and back, but the universe provides a somewhat tinny and perfectly synched backing soundtrack whenever Kana and her friends open their mouths. In short, it both looks and sounds less like the characters are themselves singing, and more like they're all lip-syncing to some poorly mixed audio already in progress. And yes, I know that technically I'm just defining how voice-over works in animation, but I'm talking about the effect of the production. It often doesn't quite feel like the music and the characters are operating on the same aural plane of existence, if that makes any sense.    Still, I won't complain too much, because it was very fun to watch the girls get to know each other and show off their vocal skills, and some of the banter we get is the closest that I've ever seen an anime get to a Broadway styled patter song. Plus, we get to spend a half-hour in a world where, when a little kid's grandmother collapses on the floor, she really can be saved with the power of a good show tune. That's the kind of world I want to live in, if only in weekly chunks of about twenty-three minutes each. Healer Girl may not be quite the full-scale song-and-dance production that I've been waiting for, but it's a damned good time for anyone that needs an extra dose of musical healing this season.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We get a lot of music-related anime – mostly idol shows – but it's exceedingly rare that we get a full-on West Side Story-style Capital-M Musical anime. While Healer Girl doesn't go all the way into that territory, it gets pretty darn close, and the result is a vibrant and earnest little treat. You're just going to need a stomach for unerringly saccharine sentimentality to get through it.    Make no mistake: if you're the kind of person who starts to grimace when characters snap their gaze into the middle distance and start singing their feelings, you will find nothing but pain here. Healer Girl is such a bubbly show in tone, aesthetic, and presentation, that it has no place for a concept so cynical as cringe. It's dancing forward down the street, humming a pop ballad too loudly with its airpods on full blast, and you can either trot along to its tune or hastily cross the street to avoid it.    Me, I love musicals, even if this show's audio sensibilities aren't really my jam. But that's more than made up for by the wonderful, colorful, constantly expressive animation that brings these characters and their songs to life. The way each of them moves, especially in their flowy “Healer” robes, is just a delight to take in. The characters themselves are likable enough, though not particularly deep or novel. But the way they're characterized through movement, how they physically interact with each other and the world around them, is just so charming that it overrides any writing deficiencies.    And because there's not a speck of cynicism in Healer Girl's body, that all manages to make Kana and her friends really fun to just watch, whether they're healing the sick or goofing around to avoid filling out paperwork. My favorite scene is easily the one where Kana asks her fellow apprentices why they chose to be Healers, and they all start spontaneously singing their motivations. It's campy, silly, and caps off with Hibiki getting so caught up in singing about her admiration for their teacher that nothing can stop her. It takes what could be a by-the-books bit of character exposition and turns it into something with way more personality, and if the rest of the show can add touches like that, I think this will turn out to be a wonderful little show.    There are most certainly people who will be put off by the chord this show is striking, and I totally get that. Healer Girl is prancing right on the line between earnest iyashikei and irritating pabulum, and no amount of stellar production is going to make you like something you find annoyingly pwecious. But at least for this first episode, I'm happy to sing along with this sugary sweet bubblegum bop.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's not exactly a secret that singing can sometimes help to calm you down or otherwise affect your mood, and I'm not just saying that because my mother took The King and I's advice about whistling a happy tune to forget you're afraid pretty literally. (Because who doesn't want terrible musical accompaniment on a harrowing boat trip?) Healer Girl may be taking the concept a bit too far, though, with its fancy third branch of medicine and an apprenticeship program to train girls into fully-fledged musical healers. Do male voices not work as well? Are there no accredited musical medical schools? Who knows? It's a musical, pesky things like serious questions aren't necessary here.    And this really is a fairly classic musical. While there's singing to heal a variety of ailments, we also have a couple of instances where people just burst into song to explain things like why they got into musical healing in the first place, and before we know what's going on in that opening scene, Kana walking down the street singing at full blast and the stunned facial expressions of the folks on the street certainly looks like something straight out of a self-aware musical. Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing.

Our main trio are all well-drawn, both literally and as likable character archetypes, and they all possess the nearly unbearable levels of sincerity it takes to make it as the leads of a musical, not to mention some incredibly toned diaphragms, and the whole “Being able to magically heal the wounds of the sick with nothing but the power of music” thing. The show looks good, it's cute and charming when it needs to be, and most importantly, it's got the tunes it needs to back up its premise.    Now, if I'm being honest, the style of singing we get in this premiere is just a bit treacly for my taste, and I was a little put off by some of the strange mixing choices—not only are the girls' voices auto-tuned to heck and back, but the universe provides a somewhat tinny and perfectly synched backing soundtrack whenever Kana and her friends open their mouths. In short, it both looks and sounds less like the characters are themselves singing, and more like they're all lip-syncing to some poorly mixed audio already in progress. And yes, I know that technically I'm just defining how voice-over works in animation, but I'm talking about the effect of the production. It often doesn't quite feel like the music and the characters are operating on the same aural plane of existence, if that makes any sense.    Still, I won't complain too much, because it was very fun to watch the girls get to know each other and show off their vocal skills, and some of the banter we get is the closest that I've ever seen an anime get to a Broadway styled patter song. Plus, we get to spend a half-hour in a world where, when a little kid's grandmother collapses on the floor, she really can be saved with the power of a good show tune. That's the kind of world I want to live in, if only in weekly chunks of about twenty-three minutes each. Healer Girl may not be quite the full-scale song-and-dance production that I've been waiting for, but it's a damned good time for anyone that needs an extra dose of musical healing this season.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We get a lot of music-related anime – mostly idol shows – but it's exceedingly rare that we get a full-on West Side Story-style Capital-M Musical anime. While Healer Girl doesn't go all the way into that territory, it gets pretty darn close, and the result is a vibrant and earnest little treat. You're just going to need a stomach for unerringly saccharine sentimentality to get through it.    Make no mistake: if you're the kind of person who starts to grimace when characters snap their gaze into the middle distance and start singing their feelings, you will find nothing but pain here. Healer Girl is such a bubbly show in tone, aesthetic, and presentation, that it has no place for a concept so cynical as cringe. It's dancing forward down the street, humming a pop ballad too loudly with its airpods on full blast, and you can either trot along to its tune or hastily cross the street to avoid it.    Me, I love musicals, even if this show's audio sensibilities aren't really my jam. But that's more than made up for by the wonderful, colorful, constantly expressive animation that brings these characters and their songs to life. The way each of them moves, especially in their flowy “Healer” robes, is just a delight to take in. The characters themselves are likable enough, though not particularly deep or novel. But the way they're characterized through movement, how they physically interact with each other and the world around them, is just so charming that it overrides any writing deficiencies.    And because there's not a speck of cynicism in Healer Girl's body, that all manages to make Kana and her friends really fun to just watch, whether they're healing the sick or goofing around to avoid filling out paperwork. My favorite scene is easily the one where Kana asks her fellow apprentices why they chose to be Healers, and they all start spontaneously singing their motivations. It's campy, silly, and caps off with Hibiki getting so caught up in singing about her admiration for their teacher that nothing can stop her. It takes what could be a by-the-books bit of character exposition and turns it into something with way more personality, and if the rest of the show can add touches like that, I think this will turn out to be a wonderful little show.    There are most certainly people who will be put off by the chord this show is striking, and I totally get that. Healer Girl is prancing right on the line between earnest iyashikei and irritating pabulum, and no amount of stellar production is going to make you like something you find annoyingly pwecious. But at least for this first episode, I'm happy to sing along with this sugary sweet bubblegum bop.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's not exactly a secret that singing can sometimes help to calm you down or otherwise affect your mood, and I'm not just saying that because my mother took The King and I's advice about whistling a happy tune to forget you're afraid pretty literally. (Because who doesn't want terrible musical accompaniment on a harrowing boat trip?) Healer Girl may be taking the concept a bit too far, though, with its fancy third branch of medicine and an apprenticeship program to train girls into fully-fledged musical healers. Do male voices not work as well? Are there no accredited musical medical schools? Who knows? It's a musical, pesky things like serious questions aren't necessary here.    And this really is a fairly classic musical. While there's singing to heal a variety of ailments, we also have a couple of instances where people just burst into song to explain things like why they got into musical healing in the first place, and before we know what's going on in that opening scene, Kana walking down the street singing at full blast and the stunned facial expressions of the folks on the street certainly looks like something straight out of a self-aware musical. Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.     discuss this in the forum (309 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Those that use ""voice medicine,"" the ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses with song, are called ""healers."" There are three apprentice healers working at the Karasuma Voice Treatment Center. Kana Fujii, an energetic girl who sets the tone, the strong-willed lady Reimi Itsushiro, and Hibiki Morishima who is caring but firm. These three first year high school girls are training after school to become full-fledged Healers. With the addition of Sonia Yanagi, a returnee who is a certified C-level healer, the girls are singing songs of healing as they work towards their dreams.    Healer Girl is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While the first episode of Healer Girl is an enjoyable enough introduction to our typical cute girl trio—i.e., the well-intentioned screw-up, the calm one, and the overly serious one—what really captured my attention was the world they exist in. Healer Girl is a world in which singing is an accepted form of medical treatment with results on par with Western medicine. This is a fun idea—it's basically a form of magic being incorporated into everyday society. More interesting still is that natural talent is apparently a prerequisite for healing through singing—though even recordings of these healers will give at least some relief. As a person who loves hard magic systems (i.e., magic systems with concrete rules on how and why they work the way they do), it was a blast to learn about the girls' singing powers.    At the same time, however, the central conflict of the episode doesn't make sense. The show is structured around the conceit that magical singers are basically doctors. As such, they can't heal without a license. But why? The reason doctors need licenses is that, when dealing with invasive medical procedures or dangerous medications, an ignorant person could do far more harm than good.  But can a magical song hurt a patient? We see no sign of this as, according to the character dialogue, the only downside of poor singing is that it makes the treatment less effective.    I'm guessing that what Kana did in the climax counts as first aid rather than healing, but it made me wonder where exactly the line is. (It also made me wonder if a normal first aid kit in this world comes with a non-prescription MP3 player to help in emergencies.)    If it comes off like I dislike the show, let me assure you that I'm not. It's the opposite, actually.  I enjoyed the show so much that I am invested in the world it is trying to build—that is why these issues stand out. I want this world to feel as real as possible.    And as for the music, while I wouldn't call the songs bangers, they were decent enough. But what I absolutely loved more than the songs themselves was the extensive use of diegetic music. When the girls break into song in public, they are actually singing and the people around them act accordingly. And, due to their profession, their constant singing makes total sense. (As a onetime musical theater/choir kid, let me tell you, randomly singing at your friends is actually rather normal.) It adds yet another layer to the world-building and makes it feel even more, well, real. And while it has some plot holes that need filling, it's a world I am loving spending time in.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               Oh wow, a musical anime! I hope it'll be just like my favorite anime, Lost Song!    Just kidding. Lost Song has never been and never will be anyone's favorite anime. Healer Girl, on the other hand, stands a pretty chance of becoming beloved by at least some and, if it keeps on track, maybe even many. This sweet little musical series, with its bright, colorful aesthetic and strong direction with dynamic camera work by industry veteran Yasuhiro Irie, has presented a strong premiere, even if it's not totally my thing.    While I wasn't particularly drawn in by the character writing – Karin is a pretty typical overenthusiastic but gifted newbie with her two best friends to corral her – the world fascinated me. Musical healing exists right alongside Eastern and Western medicine, and is presented as empirically effective. A kid has a scraped knee, Karin sings to him, his knee heals, all is well. Not a lot of room for skepticism there. I have so many questions, but in a good, “I'm curious about this worldbuilding” way rather than the way of “this makes no sense if you think about it for ten seconds.” Why would people choose the more invasive forms of medicine over musical healing? Clearly this form of medicine has its limits, since their instructor sent their client, an old woman with respiratory problems, to a hospital. What are they? Is there an in-universe reason for why all the healers are girls?    My biggest issue lies in the music. Plainly put, it's bland. It's like the most boring, forgettable Disney soundtrack ever conceived, and I'm not convinced that it can carry the show. Oh sure, the number where the girls start singing to each other about why they want to become healers is kind of fun, but it's unfocused and there doesn't seem to be much reason for it to be a song. It's more like an opera's libretto than anything you'd find in the standard structure of a musical.    Still, I doubt that'll be enough to put off most of the people who will be drawn in by this.        James Beckett  Rating:               I freaking love musicals. One of my longtime dreams has been to see a studio produce a big-budget, no- holds-barred Broadway-style musical. I'm not talking about an idol series or a show about a rock band, or an episode of a slice-of-life anime where the kids put on a concert for their culture festival. I'm talking about the pure, undiluted cheese that comes from regular characters interrupting the story to break out into perfectly choreographed dance numbers, belt their hearts out, and then move on as if nothing completely insane has just happened.

You're just going to need a stomach for unerringly saccharine sentimentality to get through it.    Make no mistake: if you're the kind of person who starts to grimace when characters snap their gaze into the middle distance and start singing their feelings, you will find nothing but pain here. Healer Girl is such a bubbly show in tone, aesthetic, and presentation, that it has no place for a concept so cynical as cringe. It's dancing forward down the street, humming a pop ballad too loudly with its airpods on full blast, and you can either trot along to its tune or hastily cross the street to avoid it.    Me, I love musicals, even if this show's audio sensibilities aren't really my jam. But that's more than made up for by the wonderful, colorful, constantly expressive animation that brings these characters and their songs to life. The way each of them moves, especially in their flowy “Healer” robes, is just a delight to take in. The characters themselves are likable enough, though not particularly deep or novel. But the way they're characterized through movement, how they physically interact with each other and the world around them, is just so charming that it overrides any writing deficiencies.    And because there's not a speck of cynicism in Healer Girl's body, that all manages to make Kana and her friends really fun to just watch, whether they're healing the sick or goofing around to avoid filling out paperwork. My favorite scene is easily the one where Kana asks her fellow apprentices why they chose to be Healers, and they all start spontaneously singing their motivations. It's campy, silly, and caps off with Hibiki getting so caught up in singing about her admiration for their teacher that nothing can stop her. It takes what could be a by-the-books bit of character exposition and turns it into something with way more personality, and if the rest of the show can add touches like that, I think this will turn out to be a wonderful little show.    There are most certainly people who will be put off by the chord this show is striking, and I totally get that. Healer Girl is prancing right on the line between earnest iyashikei and irritating pabulum, and no amount of stellar production is going to make you like something you find annoyingly pwecious. But at least for this first episode, I'm happy to sing along with this sugary sweet bubblegum bop.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's not exactly a secret that singing can sometimes help to calm you down or otherwise affect your mood, and I'm not just saying that because my mother took The King and I's advice about whistling a happy tune to forget you're afraid pretty literally. (Because who doesn't want terrible musical accompaniment on a harrowing boat trip?) Healer Girl may be taking the concept a bit too far, though, with its fancy third branch of medicine and an apprenticeship program to train girls into fully-fledged musical healers. Do male voices not work as well? Are there no accredited musical medical schools? Who knows? It's a musical, pesky things like serious questions aren't necessary here.    And this really is a fairly classic musical. While there's singing to heal a variety of ailments, we also have a couple of instances where people just burst into song to explain things like why they got into musical healing in the first place, and before we know what's going on in that opening scene, Kana walking down the street singing at full blast and the stunned facial expressions of the folks on the street certainly looks like something straight out of a self-aware musical. Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.     discuss this in the forum (309 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Those that use ""voice medicine,"" the ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses with song, are called ""healers."" There are three apprentice healers working at the Karasuma Voice Treatment Center. Kana Fujii, an energetic girl who sets the tone, the strong-willed lady Reimi Itsushiro, and Hibiki Morishima who is caring but firm. These three first year high school girls are training after school to become full-fledged Healers. With the addition of Sonia Yanagi, a returnee who is a certified C-level healer, the girls are singing songs of healing as they work towards their dreams.    Healer Girl is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While the first episode of Healer Girl is an enjoyable enough introduction to our typical cute girl trio—i.e., the well-intentioned screw-up, the calm one, and the overly serious one—what really captured my attention was the world they exist in. Healer Girl is a world in which singing is an accepted form of medical treatment with results on par with Western medicine. This is a fun idea—it's basically a form of magic being incorporated into everyday society. More interesting still is that natural talent is apparently a prerequisite for healing through singing—though even recordings of these healers will give at least some relief. As a person who loves hard magic systems (i.e., magic systems with concrete rules on how and why they work the way they do), it was a blast to learn about the girls' singing powers.    At the same time, however, the central conflict of the episode doesn't make sense. The show is structured around the conceit that magical singers are basically doctors. As such, they can't heal without a license. But why? The reason doctors need licenses is that, when dealing with invasive medical procedures or dangerous medications, an ignorant person could do far more harm than good.  But can a magical song hurt a patient? We see no sign of this as, according to the character dialogue, the only downside of poor singing is that it makes the treatment less effective.    I'm guessing that what Kana did in the climax counts as first aid rather than healing, but it made me wonder where exactly the line is. (It also made me wonder if a normal first aid kit in this world comes with a non-prescription MP3 player to help in emergencies.)    If it comes off like I dislike the show, let me assure you that I'm not. It's the opposite, actually.  I enjoyed the show so much that I am invested in the world it is trying to build—that is why these issues stand out. I want this world to feel as real as possible.    And as for the music, while I wouldn't call the songs bangers, they were decent enough. But what I absolutely loved more than the songs themselves was the extensive use of diegetic music. When the girls break into song in public, they are actually singing and the people around them act accordingly. And, due to their profession, their constant singing makes total sense. (As a onetime musical theater/choir kid, let me tell you, randomly singing at your friends is actually rather normal.) It adds yet another layer to the world-building and makes it feel even more, well, real. And while it has some plot holes that need filling, it's a world I am loving spending time in.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               Oh wow, a musical anime! I hope it'll be just like my favorite anime, Lost Song!    Just kidding. Lost Song has never been and never will be anyone's favorite anime. Healer Girl, on the other hand, stands a pretty chance of becoming beloved by at least some and, if it keeps on track, maybe even many. This sweet little musical series, with its bright, colorful aesthetic and strong direction with dynamic camera work by industry veteran Yasuhiro Irie, has presented a strong premiere, even if it's not totally my thing.    While I wasn't particularly drawn in by the character writing – Karin is a pretty typical overenthusiastic but gifted newbie with her two best friends to corral her – the world fascinated me. Musical healing exists right alongside Eastern and Western medicine, and is presented as empirically effective. A kid has a scraped knee, Karin sings to him, his knee heals, all is well. Not a lot of room for skepticism there. I have so many questions, but in a good, “I'm curious about this worldbuilding” way rather than the way of “this makes no sense if you think about it for ten seconds.” Why would people choose the more invasive forms of medicine over musical healing? Clearly this form of medicine has its limits, since their instructor sent their client, an old woman with respiratory problems, to a hospital. What are they? Is there an in-universe reason for why all the healers are girls?    My biggest issue lies in the music. Plainly put, it's bland. It's like the most boring, forgettable Disney soundtrack ever conceived, and I'm not convinced that it can carry the show. Oh sure, the number where the girls start singing to each other about why they want to become healers is kind of fun, but it's unfocused and there doesn't seem to be much reason for it to be a song. It's more like an opera's libretto than anything you'd find in the standard structure of a musical.    Still, I doubt that'll be enough to put off most of the people who will be drawn in by this.        James Beckett  Rating:               I freaking love musicals. One of my longtime dreams has been to see a studio produce a big-budget, no- holds-barred Broadway-style musical. I'm not talking about an idol series or a show about a rock band, or an episode of a slice-of-life anime where the kids put on a concert for their culture festival. I'm talking about the pure, undiluted cheese that comes from regular characters interrupting the story to break out into perfectly choreographed dance numbers, belt their hearts out, and then move on as if nothing completely insane has just happened. Does anyone here remember Galavant? That show rules. I basically want an anime Galavant.    Healer Girl is not anime Galavant, sadly, but it's the closest we've gotten to the dream, gosh darn it, and it made me extremely happy anyways. Our main trio are all well-drawn, both literally and as likable character archetypes, and they all possess the nearly unbearable levels of sincerity it takes to make it as the leads of a musical, not to mention some incredibly toned diaphragms, and the whole “Being able to magically heal the wounds of the sick with nothing but the power of music” thing. The show looks good, it's cute and charming when it needs to be, and most importantly, it's got the tunes it needs to back up its premise.    Now, if I'm being honest, the style of singing we get in this premiere is just a bit treacly for my taste, and I was a little put off by some of the strange mixing choices—not only are the girls' voices auto-tuned to heck and back, but the universe provides a somewhat tinny and perfectly synched backing soundtrack whenever Kana and her friends open their mouths. In short, it both looks and sounds less like the characters are themselves singing, and more like they're all lip-syncing to some poorly mixed audio already in progress. And yes, I know that technically I'm just defining how voice-over works in animation, but I'm talking about the effect of the production. It often doesn't quite feel like the music and the characters are operating on the same aural plane of existence, if that makes any sense.    Still, I won't complain too much, because it was very fun to watch the girls get to know each other and show off their vocal skills, and some of the banter we get is the closest that I've ever seen an anime get to a Broadway styled patter song. Plus, we get to spend a half-hour in a world where, when a little kid's grandmother collapses on the floor, she really can be saved with the power of a good show tune. That's the kind of world I want to live in, if only in weekly chunks of about twenty-three minutes each. Healer Girl may not be quite the full-scale song-and-dance production that I've been waiting for, but it's a damned good time for anyone that needs an extra dose of musical healing this season.

Healer Girl may be taking the concept a bit too far, though, with its fancy third branch of medicine and an apprenticeship program to train girls into fully-fledged musical healers. Do male voices not work as well? Are there no accredited musical medical schools? Who knows? It's a musical, pesky things like serious questions aren't necessary here.    And this really is a fairly classic musical. While there's singing to heal a variety of ailments, we also have a couple of instances where people just burst into song to explain things like why they got into musical healing in the first place, and before we know what's going on in that opening scene, Kana walking down the street singing at full blast and the stunned facial expressions of the folks on the street certainly looks like something straight out of a self-aware musical. Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.     discuss this in the forum (309 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Those that use ""voice medicine,"" the ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses with song, are called ""healers."" There are three apprentice healers working at the Karasuma Voice Treatment Center. Kana Fujii, an energetic girl who sets the tone, the strong-willed lady Reimi Itsushiro, and Hibiki Morishima who is caring but firm. These three first year high school girls are training after school to become full-fledged Healers. With the addition of Sonia Yanagi, a returnee who is a certified C-level healer, the girls are singing songs of healing as they work towards their dreams.    Healer Girl is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While the first episode of Healer Girl is an enjoyable enough introduction to our typical cute girl trio—i.e., the well-intentioned screw-up, the calm one, and the overly serious one—what really captured my attention was the world they exist in. Healer Girl is a world in which singing is an accepted form of medical treatment with results on par with Western medicine. This is a fun idea—it's basically a form of magic being incorporated into everyday society. More interesting still is that natural talent is apparently a prerequisite for healing through singing—though even recordings of these healers will give at least some relief. As a person who loves hard magic systems (i.e., magic systems with concrete rules on how and why they work the way they do), it was a blast to learn about the girls' singing powers.    At the same time, however, the central conflict of the episode doesn't make sense. The show is structured around the conceit that magical singers are basically doctors. As such, they can't heal without a license. But why? The reason doctors need licenses is that, when dealing with invasive medical procedures or dangerous medications, an ignorant person could do far more harm than good.  But can a magical song hurt a patient? We see no sign of this as, according to the character dialogue, the only downside of poor singing is that it makes the treatment less effective.    I'm guessing that what Kana did in the climax counts as first aid rather than healing, but it made me wonder where exactly the line is. (It also made me wonder if a normal first aid kit in this world comes with a non-prescription MP3 player to help in emergencies.)    If it comes off like I dislike the show, let me assure you that I'm not. It's the opposite, actually.  I enjoyed the show so much that I am invested in the world it is trying to build—that is why these issues stand out. I want this world to feel as real as possible.    And as for the music, while I wouldn't call the songs bangers, they were decent enough. But what I absolutely loved more than the songs themselves was the extensive use of diegetic music. When the girls break into song in public, they are actually singing and the people around them act accordingly. And, due to their profession, their constant singing makes total sense. (As a onetime musical theater/choir kid, let me tell you, randomly singing at your friends is actually rather normal.) It adds yet another layer to the world-building and makes it feel even more, well, real. And while it has some plot holes that need filling, it's a world I am loving spending time in.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               Oh wow, a musical anime! I hope it'll be just like my favorite anime, Lost Song!    Just kidding. Lost Song has never been and never will be anyone's favorite anime. Healer Girl, on the other hand, stands a pretty chance of becoming beloved by at least some and, if it keeps on track, maybe even many. This sweet little musical series, with its bright, colorful aesthetic and strong direction with dynamic camera work by industry veteran Yasuhiro Irie, has presented a strong premiere, even if it's not totally my thing.    While I wasn't particularly drawn in by the character writing – Karin is a pretty typical overenthusiastic but gifted newbie with her two best friends to corral her – the world fascinated me. Musical healing exists right alongside Eastern and Western medicine, and is presented as empirically effective. A kid has a scraped knee, Karin sings to him, his knee heals, all is well. Not a lot of room for skepticism there. I have so many questions, but in a good, “I'm curious about this worldbuilding” way rather than the way of “this makes no sense if you think about it for ten seconds.” Why would people choose the more invasive forms of medicine over musical healing? Clearly this form of medicine has its limits, since their instructor sent their client, an old woman with respiratory problems, to a hospital. What are they? Is there an in-universe reason for why all the healers are girls?    My biggest issue lies in the music. Plainly put, it's bland. It's like the most boring, forgettable Disney soundtrack ever conceived, and I'm not convinced that it can carry the show. Oh sure, the number where the girls start singing to each other about why they want to become healers is kind of fun, but it's unfocused and there doesn't seem to be much reason for it to be a song. It's more like an opera's libretto than anything you'd find in the standard structure of a musical.    Still, I doubt that'll be enough to put off most of the people who will be drawn in by this.        James Beckett  Rating:               I freaking love musicals. One of my longtime dreams has been to see a studio produce a big-budget, no- holds-barred Broadway-style musical. I'm not talking about an idol series or a show about a rock band, or an episode of a slice-of-life anime where the kids put on a concert for their culture festival. I'm talking about the pure, undiluted cheese that comes from regular characters interrupting the story to break out into perfectly choreographed dance numbers, belt their hearts out, and then move on as if nothing completely insane has just happened. Does anyone here remember Galavant? That show rules. I basically want an anime Galavant.    Healer Girl is not anime Galavant, sadly, but it's the closest we've gotten to the dream, gosh darn it, and it made me extremely happy anyways. Our main trio are all well-drawn, both literally and as likable character archetypes, and they all possess the nearly unbearable levels of sincerity it takes to make it as the leads of a musical, not to mention some incredibly toned diaphragms, and the whole “Being able to magically heal the wounds of the sick with nothing but the power of music” thing. The show looks good, it's cute and charming when it needs to be, and most importantly, it's got the tunes it needs to back up its premise.    Now, if I'm being honest, the style of singing we get in this premiere is just a bit treacly for my taste, and I was a little put off by some of the strange mixing choices—not only are the girls' voices auto-tuned to heck and back, but the universe provides a somewhat tinny and perfectly synched backing soundtrack whenever Kana and her friends open their mouths. In short, it both looks and sounds less like the characters are themselves singing, and more like they're all lip-syncing to some poorly mixed audio already in progress. And yes, I know that technically I'm just defining how voice-over works in animation, but I'm talking about the effect of the production. It often doesn't quite feel like the music and the characters are operating on the same aural plane of existence, if that makes any sense.    Still, I won't complain too much, because it was very fun to watch the girls get to know each other and show off their vocal skills, and some of the banter we get is the closest that I've ever seen an anime get to a Broadway styled patter song. Plus, we get to spend a half-hour in a world where, when a little kid's grandmother collapses on the floor, she really can be saved with the power of a good show tune. That's the kind of world I want to live in, if only in weekly chunks of about twenty-three minutes each. Healer Girl may not be quite the full-scale song-and-dance production that I've been waiting for, but it's a damned good time for anyone that needs an extra dose of musical healing this season.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We get a lot of music-related anime – mostly idol shows – but it's exceedingly rare that we get a full-on West Side Story-style Capital-M Musical anime. While Healer Girl doesn't go all the way into that territory, it gets pretty darn close, and the result is a vibrant and earnest little treat. You're just going to need a stomach for unerringly saccharine sentimentality to get through it.    Make no mistake: if you're the kind of person who starts to grimace when characters snap their gaze into the middle distance and start singing their feelings, you will find nothing but pain here. Healer Girl is such a bubbly show in tone, aesthetic, and presentation, that it has no place for a concept so cynical as cringe. It's dancing forward down the street, humming a pop ballad too loudly with its airpods on full blast, and you can either trot along to its tune or hastily cross the street to avoid it.    Me, I love musicals, even if this show's audio sensibilities aren't really my jam. But that's more than made up for by the wonderful, colorful, constantly expressive animation that brings these characters and their songs to life. The way each of them moves, especially in their flowy “Healer” robes, is just a delight to take in. The characters themselves are likable enough, though not particularly deep or novel. But the way they're characterized through movement, how they physically interact with each other and the world around them, is just so charming that it overrides any writing deficiencies.    And because there's not a speck of cynicism in Healer Girl's body, that all manages to make Kana and her friends really fun to just watch, whether they're healing the sick or goofing around to avoid filling out paperwork. My favorite scene is easily the one where Kana asks her fellow apprentices why they chose to be Healers, and they all start spontaneously singing their motivations. It's campy, silly, and caps off with Hibiki getting so caught up in singing about her admiration for their teacher that nothing can stop her. It takes what could be a by-the-books bit of character exposition and turns it into something with way more personality, and if the rest of the show can add touches like that, I think this will turn out to be a wonderful little show.    There are most certainly people who will be put off by the chord this show is striking, and I totally get that. Healer Girl is prancing right on the line between earnest iyashikei and irritating pabulum, and no amount of stellar production is going to make you like something you find annoyingly pwecious. But at least for this first episode, I'm happy to sing along with this sugary sweet bubblegum bop.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (309 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (309 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (309 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (309 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids.

Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (309 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names.

I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (309 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"
27-04-2022,anime,12,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/fanfare-of-adolescence/.183511,Fanfare of Adolescence - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"   The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it.

27-04-2022,anime,12,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/fanfare-of-adolescence/.183511,Fanfare of Adolescence - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"                How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant.

Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.

Easy to say it will be on the same level as GFL anime, if not even worse.

That's quite the insult, the GFL anime was quite the disaster, in text form yes it seems quite weak, but it being animated can definitely bring more excitement and fix that.

No, that's the exact problem - even if the story gets in anime form, the beginning still will be the same mess that can be described as ""13 Hours, but the evac team is a bunch of who and MC is amnesiac"" - which is can be good for die-hard fans who know the characters - but for new people, it will be just gibberish nonsense between the action scenes.   And then they also pushed it to the TV anime format instead of something close to OVA/movie, with supposed stretching the whole ""operation"" to a whole 4-6 weekly episodes minimum (cause by posters, they are adapting only the prologue and next Lungmen arc) - which is complete overkill to make things boring even with the good animation.

CN TV Listings have confirmed it to be 8 episodes, which is fine for the first 3 chapters, guessing by the pv it will stop there. And of course, they can always add in more info to have the viewer understand what's going on, which is more likely. I have quite a lot of hope in Yostar Pictures, as Bisoku Zenshin was a good adaptation, but we just have to see how it plays out.

Easy to say it will be on the same level as GFL anime, if not even worse.

That's quite the insult, the GFL anime was quite the disaster, in text form yes it seems quite weak, but it being animated can definitely bring more excitement and fix that.

No, that's the exact problem - even if the story gets in anime form, the beginning still will be the same mess that can be described as ""13 Hours, but the evac team is a bunch of who and MC is amnesiac"" - which is can be good for die-hard fans who know the characters - but for new people, it will be just gibberish nonsense between the action scenes.   And then they also pushed it to the TV anime format instead of something close to OVA/movie, with supposed stretching the whole ""operation"" to a whole 4-6 weekly episodes minimum (cause by posters, they are adapting only the prologue and next Lungmen arc) - which is complete overkill to make things boring even with the good animation.

CN TV Listings have confirmed it to be 8 episodes, which is fine for the first 3 chapters, guessing by the pv it will stop there. And of course, they can always add in more info to have the viewer understand what's going on, which is more likely. I have quite a lot of hope in Yostar Pictures, as Bisoku Zenshin was a good adaptation, but we just have to see how it plays out.

No, that's the exact problem - even if the story gets in anime form, the beginning still will be the same mess that can be described as ""13 Hours, but the evac team is a bunch of who and MC is amnesiac"" - which is can be good for die-hard fans who know the characters - but for new people, it will be just gibberish nonsense between the action scenes.   And then they also pushed it to the TV anime format instead of something close to OVA/movie, with supposed stretching the whole ""operation"" to a whole 4-6 weekly episodes minimum (cause by posters, they are adapting only the prologue and next Lungmen arc) - which is complete overkill to make things boring even with the good animation.

CN TV Listings have confirmed it to be 8 episodes, which is fine for the first 3 chapters, guessing by the pv it will stop there.

I have quite a lot of hope in Yostar Pictures, as Bisoku Zenshin was a good adaptation, but we just have to see how it plays out.

No, that's the exact problem - even if the story gets in anime form, the beginning still will be the same mess that can be described as ""13 Hours, but the evac team is a bunch of who and MC is amnesiac"" - which is can be good for die-hard fans who know the characters - but for new people, it will be just gibberish nonsense between the action scenes.

CN TV Listings have confirmed it to be 8 episodes, which is fine for the first 3 chapters, guessing by the pv it will stop there. And of course, they can always add in more info to have the viewer understand what's going on, which is more likely. I have quite a lot of hope in Yostar Pictures, as Bisoku Zenshin was a good adaptation, but we just have to see how it plays out.

This Week in Anime What the Hell is Going On in Estab Life?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 21st 2022           ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape defies explanation. A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I know we like to kick these off with things like ""jokes,"" and otherwise be ""entertaining"" during these columns, but I'm so mentally stunlocked by our featured show this week that I have no idea where to start. I mean, what am I to do when I have this picture of a communist penguin holding a handgun with his adorable little flippers? Where do I go from here?     Nick  I don't know what your problem is Steve. I for one am very thankful we got to see Re:cycle of Penguindrum so early.    Gotta say though, a lot more guns in this version than I remember from the TV series.     That's Ikuhara for you. Ever the perfectionist.     OK so yeah, this isn't actually Penguindrum. Instead this little CG fever dream is from a different old-school anime creator. Namely, Shoji Gatoh, creator of Full Metal Panic! here to deliver...whatever the fuck ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape is.     So this is one of those always highly vaunted ""mixed media projects,"" a.k.a. ""you knuckleheads better scarf down this anime slop and regurgitate all your money into the eventual gacha game."" Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting. Like I can figure out there's different walled-off sci-fi cities that are based on different areas of Japan, but I looked up the initial synopsis and 90% is news to me:     It honestly owns. Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.    So that's why normal people need the help of strangely named and dressed anime girls who are each varying degrees of gay for the other.        I also just noticed the little guy in the Extractors logo looks exactly that the Da Share Z0ne post. Excellent.   Ah yes, our heroines. Charming, cute anime girls here to help you escape your problems!     They're very professional and good at what they do.         Equa is kind of like if a Love Live! girl escaped containment and became the leader of an underground spy syndicate. Also she might be immortal. It's unclear. The most concrete thing we really know about her is that Martes is borderline-criminally in love with her.      To the point that, as early as week 4, the show breaks formula in order to give us a full episode devoted to the machinations of Martes' inner self. Oh, also Martes is a slime.     They introduce us to that concept by letting Martes get sniped by a drone and having her head-slime spray out like blue viscera. Which is probably a more exciting method than a teacher explaining the science behind slime girls.   To be fair, I could do with a little more context about the science behind slime girls. Right now, all we've been able to glean is that it involves amino acids and a cordoned-off part of your personality that's obsessed with eschewing underwear.      I think the perverts of the internet have long come up with horrifyingly detailed answers for that last one, so best not to dwell on it. Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.   For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.     Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.     And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird. There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it. But if, say, it picks an unfunny joke for its episodic nucleus, you get 10 minutes of everyone telling Feles to take off her panties.      It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be. And occasionally, it touches the sublime. But that's mostly when the total screen area meets a certain quota of clothed and coifed penguins.              discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

This Week in Anime What the Hell is Going On in Estab Life?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 21st 2022           ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape defies explanation. A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I know we like to kick these off with things like ""jokes,"" and otherwise be ""entertaining"" during these columns, but I'm so mentally stunlocked by our featured show this week that I have no idea where to start. I mean, what am I to do when I have this picture of a communist penguin holding a handgun with his adorable little flippers? Where do I go from here?     Nick  I don't know what your problem is Steve. I for one am very thankful we got to see Re:cycle of Penguindrum so early.    Gotta say though, a lot more guns in this version than I remember from the TV series.     That's Ikuhara for you. Ever the perfectionist.     OK so yeah, this isn't actually Penguindrum. Instead this little CG fever dream is from a different old-school anime creator. Namely, Shoji Gatoh, creator of Full Metal Panic! here to deliver...whatever the fuck ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape is.     So this is one of those always highly vaunted ""mixed media projects,"" a.k.a. ""you knuckleheads better scarf down this anime slop and regurgitate all your money into the eventual gacha game."" Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting. Like I can figure out there's different walled-off sci-fi cities that are based on different areas of Japan, but I looked up the initial synopsis and 90% is news to me:     It honestly owns. Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.    So that's why normal people need the help of strangely named and dressed anime girls who are each varying degrees of gay for the other.        I also just noticed the little guy in the Extractors logo looks exactly that the Da Share Z0ne post. Excellent.   Ah yes, our heroines. Charming, cute anime girls here to help you escape your problems!     They're very professional and good at what they do.         Equa is kind of like if a Love Live! girl escaped containment and became the leader of an underground spy syndicate. Also she might be immortal. It's unclear. The most concrete thing we really know about her is that Martes is borderline-criminally in love with her.      To the point that, as early as week 4, the show breaks formula in order to give us a full episode devoted to the machinations of Martes' inner self. Oh, also Martes is a slime.     They introduce us to that concept by letting Martes get sniped by a drone and having her head-slime spray out like blue viscera. Which is probably a more exciting method than a teacher explaining the science behind slime girls.   To be fair, I could do with a little more context about the science behind slime girls. Right now, all we've been able to glean is that it involves amino acids and a cordoned-off part of your personality that's obsessed with eschewing underwear.      I think the perverts of the internet have long come up with horrifyingly detailed answers for that last one, so best not to dwell on it. Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.   For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.     Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.     And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird. There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it. But if, say, it picks an unfunny joke for its episodic nucleus, you get 10 minutes of everyone telling Feles to take off her panties.      It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be. And occasionally, it touches the sublime. But that's mostly when the total screen area meets a certain quota of clothed and coifed penguins.              discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

This Week in Anime What the Hell is Going On in Estab Life?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 21st 2022           ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape defies explanation. A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I know we like to kick these off with things like ""jokes,"" and otherwise be ""entertaining"" during these columns, but I'm so mentally stunlocked by our featured show this week that I have no idea where to start. I mean, what am I to do when I have this picture of a communist penguin holding a handgun with his adorable little flippers? Where do I go from here?     Nick  I don't know what your problem is Steve. I for one am very thankful we got to see Re:cycle of Penguindrum so early.    Gotta say though, a lot more guns in this version than I remember from the TV series.     That's Ikuhara for you. Ever the perfectionist.     OK so yeah, this isn't actually Penguindrum. Instead this little CG fever dream is from a different old-school anime creator. Namely, Shoji Gatoh, creator of Full Metal Panic! here to deliver...whatever the fuck ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape is.     So this is one of those always highly vaunted ""mixed media projects,"" a.k.a. ""you knuckleheads better scarf down this anime slop and regurgitate all your money into the eventual gacha game."" Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting. Like I can figure out there's different walled-off sci-fi cities that are based on different areas of Japan, but I looked up the initial synopsis and 90% is news to me:     It honestly owns. Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.    So that's why normal people need the help of strangely named and dressed anime girls who are each varying degrees of gay for the other.        I also just noticed the little guy in the Extractors logo looks exactly that the Da Share Z0ne post. Excellent.   Ah yes, our heroines. Charming, cute anime girls here to help you escape your problems!     They're very professional and good at what they do.         Equa is kind of like if a Love Live! girl escaped containment and became the leader of an underground spy syndicate. Also she might be immortal. It's unclear. The most concrete thing we really know about her is that Martes is borderline-criminally in love with her.      To the point that, as early as week 4, the show breaks formula in order to give us a full episode devoted to the machinations of Martes' inner self. Oh, also Martes is a slime.     They introduce us to that concept by letting Martes get sniped by a drone and having her head-slime spray out like blue viscera. Which is probably a more exciting method than a teacher explaining the science behind slime girls.   To be fair, I could do with a little more context about the science behind slime girls. Right now, all we've been able to glean is that it involves amino acids and a cordoned-off part of your personality that's obsessed with eschewing underwear.      I think the perverts of the internet have long come up with horrifyingly detailed answers for that last one, so best not to dwell on it. Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.   For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.     Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.     And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird. There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it. But if, say, it picks an unfunny joke for its episodic nucleus, you get 10 minutes of everyone telling Feles to take off her panties.      It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be. And occasionally, it touches the sublime. But that's mostly when the total screen area meets a certain quota of clothed and coifed penguins.              discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

This Week in Anime What the Hell is Going On in Estab Life?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 21st 2022           ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape defies explanation. A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I know we like to kick these off with things like ""jokes,"" and otherwise be ""entertaining"" during these columns, but I'm so mentally stunlocked by our featured show this week that I have no idea where to start. I mean, what am I to do when I have this picture of a communist penguin holding a handgun with his adorable little flippers? Where do I go from here?     Nick  I don't know what your problem is Steve. I for one am very thankful we got to see Re:cycle of Penguindrum so early.    Gotta say though, a lot more guns in this version than I remember from the TV series.     That's Ikuhara for you. Ever the perfectionist.     OK so yeah, this isn't actually Penguindrum. Instead this little CG fever dream is from a different old-school anime creator. Namely, Shoji Gatoh, creator of Full Metal Panic! here to deliver...whatever the fuck ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape is.     So this is one of those always highly vaunted ""mixed media projects,"" a.k.a. ""you knuckleheads better scarf down this anime slop and regurgitate all your money into the eventual gacha game."" Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting. Like I can figure out there's different walled-off sci-fi cities that are based on different areas of Japan, but I looked up the initial synopsis and 90% is news to me:     It honestly owns. Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town.

Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be. And occasionally, it touches the sublime.

This Week in Anime What the Hell is Going On in Estab Life?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 21st 2022           ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape defies explanation. A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I know we like to kick these off with things like ""jokes,"" and otherwise be ""entertaining"" during these columns, but I'm so mentally stunlocked by our featured show this week that I have no idea where to start. I mean, what am I to do when I have this picture of a communist penguin holding a handgun with his adorable little flippers? Where do I go from here?     Nick  I don't know what your problem is Steve. I for one am very thankful we got to see Re:cycle of Penguindrum so early.    Gotta say though, a lot more guns in this version than I remember from the TV series.     That's Ikuhara for you. Ever the perfectionist.     OK so yeah, this isn't actually Penguindrum. Instead this little CG fever dream is from a different old-school anime creator. Namely, Shoji Gatoh, creator of Full Metal Panic! here to deliver...whatever the fuck ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape is.     So this is one of those always highly vaunted ""mixed media projects,"" a.k.a. ""you knuckleheads better scarf down this anime slop and regurgitate all your money into the eventual gacha game."" Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting. Like I can figure out there's different walled-off sci-fi cities that are based on different areas of Japan, but I looked up the initial synopsis and 90% is news to me:     It honestly owns. Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.    So that's why normal people need the help of strangely named and dressed anime girls who are each varying degrees of gay for the other.        I also just noticed the little guy in the Extractors logo looks exactly that the Da Share Z0ne post. Excellent.   Ah yes, our heroines. Charming, cute anime girls here to help you escape your problems!     They're very professional and good at what they do.         Equa is kind of like if a Love Live! girl escaped containment and became the leader of an underground spy syndicate. Also she might be immortal. It's unclear. The most concrete thing we really know about her is that Martes is borderline-criminally in love with her.      To the point that, as early as week 4, the show breaks formula in order to give us a full episode devoted to the machinations of Martes' inner self. Oh, also Martes is a slime.     They introduce us to that concept by letting Martes get sniped by a drone and having her head-slime spray out like blue viscera. Which is probably a more exciting method than a teacher explaining the science behind slime girls.   To be fair, I could do with a little more context about the science behind slime girls. Right now, all we've been able to glean is that it involves amino acids and a cordoned-off part of your personality that's obsessed with eschewing underwear.      I think the perverts of the internet have long come up with horrifyingly detailed answers for that last one, so best not to dwell on it. Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.   For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.     Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.     And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird. There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it. But if, say, it picks an unfunny joke for its episodic nucleus, you get 10 minutes of everyone telling Feles to take off her panties.      It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good.

The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would.

Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.     And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird. There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it. But if, say, it picks an unfunny joke for its episodic nucleus, you get 10 minutes of everyone telling Feles to take off her panties.      It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be. And occasionally, it touches the sublime. But that's mostly when the total screen area meets a certain quota of clothed and coifed penguins.              discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://twitter.com/LossThief': 1, 'https://twitter.com/mouse_inhouse': 1, 'https://twitter.com/NickyEnchilada': 1, 'https://twitter.com/vestenet': 1}"

A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I know we like to kick these off with things like ""jokes,"" and otherwise be ""entertaining"" during these columns, but I'm so mentally stunlocked by our featured show this week that I have no idea where to start. I mean, what am I to do when I have this picture of a communist penguin holding a handgun with his adorable little flippers? Where do I go from here?     Nick  I don't know what your problem is Steve. I for one am very thankful we got to see Re:cycle of Penguindrum so early.    Gotta say though, a lot more guns in this version than I remember from the TV series.     That's Ikuhara for you. Ever the perfectionist.     OK so yeah, this isn't actually Penguindrum. Instead this little CG fever dream is from a different old-school anime creator. Namely, Shoji Gatoh, creator of Full Metal Panic! here to deliver...whatever the fuck ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape is.     So this is one of those always highly vaunted ""mixed media projects,"" a.k.a. ""you knuckleheads better scarf down this anime slop and regurgitate all your money into the eventual gacha game."" Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting. Like I can figure out there's different walled-off sci-fi cities that are based on different areas of Japan, but I looked up the initial synopsis and 90% is news to me:     It honestly owns. Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.    So that's why normal people need the help of strangely named and dressed anime girls who are each varying degrees of gay for the other.        I also just noticed the little guy in the Extractors logo looks exactly that the Da Share Z0ne post. Excellent.   Ah yes, our heroines. Charming, cute anime girls here to help you escape your problems!     They're very professional and good at what they do.         Equa is kind of like if a Love Live! girl escaped containment and became the leader of an underground spy syndicate. Also she might be immortal. It's unclear. The most concrete thing we really know about her is that Martes is borderline-criminally in love with her.      To the point that, as early as week 4, the show breaks formula in order to give us a full episode devoted to the machinations of Martes' inner self. Oh, also Martes is a slime.     They introduce us to that concept by letting Martes get sniped by a drone and having her head-slime spray out like blue viscera. Which is probably a more exciting method than a teacher explaining the science behind slime girls.   To be fair, I could do with a little more context about the science behind slime girls. Right now, all we've been able to glean is that it involves amino acids and a cordoned-off part of your personality that's obsessed with eschewing underwear.      I think the perverts of the internet have long come up with horrifyingly detailed answers for that last one, so best not to dwell on it. Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.   For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.

There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it. But if, say, it picks an unfunny joke for its episodic nucleus, you get 10 minutes of everyone telling Feles to take off her panties.      It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be. And occasionally, it touches the sublime. But that's mostly when the total screen area meets a certain quota of clothed and coifed penguins.              discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://twitter.com/LossThief': 1, 'https://twitter.com/mouse_inhouse': 1, 'https://twitter.com/NickyEnchilada': 1, 'https://twitter.com/vestenet': 1}"

A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I know we like to kick these off with things like ""jokes,"" and otherwise be ""entertaining"" during these columns, but I'm so mentally stunlocked by our featured show this week that I have no idea where to start. I mean, what am I to do when I have this picture of a communist penguin holding a handgun with his adorable little flippers? Where do I go from here?     Nick  I don't know what your problem is Steve. I for one am very thankful we got to see Re:cycle of Penguindrum so early.    Gotta say though, a lot more guns in this version than I remember from the TV series.     That's Ikuhara for you. Ever the perfectionist.     OK so yeah, this isn't actually Penguindrum. Instead this little CG fever dream is from a different old-school anime creator. Namely, Shoji Gatoh, creator of Full Metal Panic! here to deliver...whatever the fuck ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape is.     So this is one of those always highly vaunted ""mixed media projects,"" a.k.a. ""you knuckleheads better scarf down this anime slop and regurgitate all your money into the eventual gacha game."" Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting. Like I can figure out there's different walled-off sci-fi cities that are based on different areas of Japan, but I looked up the initial synopsis and 90% is news to me:     It honestly owns. Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.    So that's why normal people need the help of strangely named and dressed anime girls who are each varying degrees of gay for the other.        I also just noticed the little guy in the Extractors logo looks exactly that the Da Share Z0ne post. Excellent.   Ah yes, our heroines. Charming, cute anime girls here to help you escape your problems!     They're very professional and good at what they do.         Equa is kind of like if a Love Live! girl escaped containment and became the leader of an underground spy syndicate. Also she might be immortal. It's unclear. The most concrete thing we really know about her is that Martes is borderline-criminally in love with her.      To the point that, as early as week 4, the show breaks formula in order to give us a full episode devoted to the machinations of Martes' inner self. Oh, also Martes is a slime.     They introduce us to that concept by letting Martes get sniped by a drone and having her head-slime spray out like blue viscera. Which is probably a more exciting method than a teacher explaining the science behind slime girls.   To be fair, I could do with a little more context about the science behind slime girls. Right now, all we've been able to glean is that it involves amino acids and a cordoned-off part of your personality that's obsessed with eschewing underwear.      I think the perverts of the internet have long come up with horrifyingly detailed answers for that last one, so best not to dwell on it. Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.   For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.     Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.     And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird.

A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I know we like to kick these off with things like ""jokes,"" and otherwise be ""entertaining"" during these columns, but I'm so mentally stunlocked by our featured show this week that I have no idea where to start. I mean, what am I to do when I have this picture of a communist penguin holding a handgun with his adorable little flippers? Where do I go from here?     Nick  I don't know what your problem is Steve. I for one am very thankful we got to see Re:cycle of Penguindrum so early.    Gotta say though, a lot more guns in this version than I remember from the TV series.     That's Ikuhara for you. Ever the perfectionist.     OK so yeah, this isn't actually Penguindrum. Instead this little CG fever dream is from a different old-school anime creator. Namely, Shoji Gatoh, creator of Full Metal Panic! here to deliver...whatever the fuck ESTAB LIFE: Great Escape is.     So this is one of those always highly vaunted ""mixed media projects,"" a.k.a. ""you knuckleheads better scarf down this anime slop and regurgitate all your money into the eventual gacha game."" Except a couple things set Estab Life apart from the soon-to-be-mobage chaff. First off, it's the brainchild of Goro Taniguchi, who's made some pretty darn good anime! I mean, he's not directing this particular one, but Back Arrow was probably last year's premiere hidden gem. And secondly, the anime seems to have been given the green light to do whatever the hell it wants, and apparently what it wants to be more than anything is an anthology of shitposts.   And what it definitely doesn't want to be is a show that explains itself. In a way I admire how little it cares about telling you any concrete details about its larger setting. Like I can figure out there's different walled-off sci-fi cities that are based on different areas of Japan, but I looked up the initial synopsis and 90% is news to me:     It honestly owns. Like, I'm so used to watching these interminable light novel adaptations that always go out of their way explaining exactly how many mana points it takes to cast magic missile. Estab Life just throws you in the deep end, and it's full of furries and robots.      I'm left to assume the ""genetically modified populations"" bit in the synopsis refers to all the animal people (and just regular animals) we meet. Meaning somewhere in the future humanity figured out how to create flesh and blood Sonic OCs.   I have to imagine nowadays that's the only reason anybody starts studying genetic engineering, so it's a future that's all but inevitable. As it should be.   Anyway, the actual story is that an intrepid group of anime girls called ""Extractors"" take on missions to help people escape their pre-determined lives in said sci-fi cities, and start new lives in other places that better suit them. So basically:     Real winners quit!! But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.    So that's why normal people need the help of strangely named and dressed anime girls who are each varying degrees of gay for the other.        I also just noticed the little guy in the Extractors logo looks exactly that the Da Share Z0ne post. Excellent.   Ah yes, our heroines. Charming, cute anime girls here to help you escape your problems!     They're very professional and good at what they do.         Equa is kind of like if a Love Live! girl escaped containment and became the leader of an underground spy syndicate. Also she might be immortal. It's unclear. The most concrete thing we really know about her is that Martes is borderline-criminally in love with her.      To the point that, as early as week 4, the show breaks formula in order to give us a full episode devoted to the machinations of Martes' inner self. Oh, also Martes is a slime.     They introduce us to that concept by letting Martes get sniped by a drone and having her head-slime spray out like blue viscera. Which is probably a more exciting method than a teacher explaining the science behind slime girls.   To be fair, I could do with a little more context about the science behind slime girls. Right now, all we've been able to glean is that it involves amino acids and a cordoned-off part of your personality that's obsessed with eschewing underwear.      I think the perverts of the internet have long come up with horrifyingly detailed answers for that last one, so best not to dwell on it. Personally I'm more confused as to what a Gun Wizard is:     I think that's just what the kids are calling tsunderes these days.      Weirdly enough being a gun wizard also ties into underwear. Because that's how this show rolls.     And that's the basic skeleton of Estab Life. Three eccentric girls and their dogman and robot sidekicks moonlight as rebels working against the societal oppressions that wear people down. But even all the jokes we've shown and made so far don't do a great job of communicating just how strange this anime is—and is constantly.   For one, the way their clients contact them is by sending coded messages through TikTok dances.    Goes to show you, sometimes shitposts really are a cry for help.   That's the first thing I was gonna bring up too! At no point do they actually stop and explain this, mind you, but every client is introduced with a double-digit view count YouTube video of them dancing like a jackass. I love it.    This is what REAL espionage looks like. [side eyes SPY x FAMILY]   It kind of reminds me of that YouTube hole game where if you search ""IMG"" followed by a string of four numbers you can find random, automatically uploaded videos with nearly no views. Except none of those have ever inspired me to dress up like a Vocaloid and help mob bosses in their quest to transition.         Estab Life eases you in episode one with a professor client who wants to die because he's sick of teaching Nietzsche. Relatable. And then it quickly ramps the stakes up with the aforementioned yakuza boss/aspiring magical girl. Which is also relatable, but you can understand how it's an escalation.     Episode one also eases you in by the escape method just being a really big zipline. It's not until Mahou Shoujo Yakuza Magica there that things go full cartoon and they just fire him out of a cannon.     Most magical girls fly, when you think about it, so I think they're just giving him another boost towards his dream. A big boost.     I think my favorite gag in that episode, though, is the weather forecast for turf wars.    The timing isn't always there, but the show has a very droll sense of humor, and I'm weak to those.   Really though, that's still training wheels. The real Estab Life doesn't take off the weights until episode three.      This was the point at which I had to very seriously reckon with the possibility that Estab Life might be good. A lesser anime would explain why there's a communist bloc in Ikebukuro. A great anime just shows you a lot of penguins in hats.     ""Good"" is a strong word, but I do appreciate its willingness to just run with whatever goofy idea crosses its mind. This is a ludicrous setting that never explains for a second why Ikebukuro is now cold war Berlin, or why it's inhabited solely by penguins. It presents it all with a totally straight face, like a true shitposter.      The drama!     The stepladder!     The slaps!    Obviously this won't come across in an image, but imagine a little squeaky sound effect when the flipper makes contact.   If the show took even a second to wink at the camera about any of this it'd be ruined, but Estab Life has the brass balls to never break face.     And of course, the punchline is a bunch of penguins spanking each other. This is true art under the umbrella of capitalism. It's beautiful.      Penguins are indeed the opiate of the masses.    Anyway after that the show basically drops its client-of-the-week setup for an extended bit out of Spongebob Squarepants.      I'm sorry, Nick, I think you meant to say that this is a pointed political satire with a lot to say about society.      Look life is complicated enough with having to factor in the unprecedented rate of Gay Inflation.     The real innovation to the mind parliament conceit here comes when a grenade bisects Martes' slime body into independent slime entities, which in turn fractures her brain into two separate diets: one governed by the lesbian party, and one governed by the dangerously lesbian party.     And as we all know, a lesbian divided cannot stand. She can, however, nuzzle her way like a slug into Equa's lap.     Really it's her fault she got bisected. Literally in the middle of a mission she just got super distracted with how gay she is.     There are talking pandas in this episode too, because why the fuck not.      And then the warring Marteses destroy the homeless panda sanctuary because that's the raw power of a Lesbian divided.         Which brings us to the moral of this story: JK there isn't one. Estab Life is beyond our puny human ethos. Now buckle up and drop trou, because we're going to Odaiba, and there's only one rule.     Yeah if it seems like we're zooming through stuff, that's only because this show is as slight as it is weird. There's not really any character development or plot to speak of, and every episode dedicates itself to a singular joke so entirely that it's hard to break it down any further.   It is capital C Committed to the capital B Bit. For better and for worse.   Which can be fun, when the episode takes a bonkers premise and runs with it. But if, say, it picks an unfunny joke for its episodic nucleus, you get 10 minutes of everyone telling Feles to take off her panties.      It's neither good nor advisable, but no other show is going to spend 16 minutes building up to a throwaway sight gag like this, and there's a deep, dark part of me that admires that.      It really does take conviction to build an entire TV show out of Sideshow Bob rake jokes. It's not necessarily good, but you're not gonna find moments like this in any other anime!      We should also mention that their god (who's an AI, but you can only pick up on that via context clues or by reading the synopsis on Wikipedia) manifests as the Statue of Liberty in a bathrobe.     That at least makes sense since Odaiba has a statue of liberty mockup. I don't think that one goes commando though.     And credit where it's due, I was expecting an easy Planet of the Apes nod by the end of the episode, but Estab Life chose to pleasantly surprise me instead.     ""Pleasantly"" might not be the right word.   It's really the only punchline you could expect from the setup. Mostly I'm just mad they didn't give Lady Liberty some red white & blue briefs. That's just not America dammit.     She does, however, provide divine intervention by way of underpants cuneiform. And I'm so glad that's a sentence I was able to write thanks to this series.      And the moral of the story was that sometimes it's ok to want to wear panties. The End.      With their overlords dropping wisdom like that, it's hard to imagine why so many people are trying to Orange Justice their way into a new walk of life.   Really though, for as much as I like the kind of humor Estab Life is going for, I do think it's a little too silly for its own good. This kind of humor works optimally when there's just enough serious and earnest stuff at its core to contrast with all the goofy bullshit, and that's just not here so far.   It also feels really strange doing a TWIA column on it, because it's such an undiluted, unfettered progression of shitposts. Shitposts are supposed to be our thing! The unstoppable force is colliding with the immovable object, and both of them are making esoteric jokes about underpants.   Hell there's even a running joke where their dog-man friend dies every episode and then just comes back unscathed. That's Sonic the Hedgehog comic tier jokes. How do we compete with that?      We can't, dammit! And as such, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's not incredible—the banter needs to be snappier, and the 3DCG doesn't do the cartoonishness of the writing any favors—but Estab Life is more amusing than it has any right to be. And occasionally, it touches the sublime. But that's mostly when the total screen area meets a certain quota of clothed and coifed penguins.

But yeah, in this world, it's not quite as simple as hopping on the next train out of town. Mostly because the trains are guarded by creepy robot attendants who will literally and immediately kill you if you don't have the right papers.

Kronii the time jokester skewed towards dark or humor (Madoka, Death Note, Ghost Stories).  Cali and Gura have chatted about Madoka together, and Cali has riffed on Ghost Stories with the Trash Taste boyz.

The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2 Episode 3  by James Beckett, Apr 24th 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.3             I'm going to do my best to keep this particular note of praise from getting old in the coming weeks, since it has consistently been one of The Demon Girl Next Door's greatest strengths, but I just really love the completely casual and effortless way that the show slips its character development and important background information into its jokey-joke scripts and slice-of-life pacing. It makes watching and rewatching the series a very rewarding experience, because the smallest of off-the-cuff lines could have very significant implications for the overall story. This is a gag anime about a really dumb but sweet demon girl who wants nothing more than to make the magical girl next door smile. It doesn't have to worry about worldbuilding or character arcs, and yet it goes the extra mile all the same.  Before we get to that, though, we have a pretty funny sketch that showcases just how terrible Shamiko is at fairly standard things, such as using the internet. It's getting increasingly more difficult these days for me to believe that any Zoomer living in a tech-savvy society would be so utterly baffled by the most basic of technological concepts, especially when it comes to social media, no matter how cosmically impoverished they may be. Is Shamiko's cluelessness a character cliché that might not totally work here in the 2020s, or is it a clue that has larger implications about the differences between our world and this magic-infused alternate universe??? Eh, it's probably that first option, but it's always fun to play along with the “Guess Which Innocuous Detail is Secretly Super Important to the Lore™” game. Besides, even if it is a little silly to have Shamiko be so comically underprepared to even log on to a single website, this is a silly show, and there are a bunch of those small humorous flourishes that DGND is so good at, like Momo's cute presentation sign, or the fact that Kyo assumes that making social media friends are essentially equivalent to soldiers being recruited into her big sister's evil army. Plus, you know my heart melted when Shamiko had to use her Whatchamacallit Wand to ask Momo to be friends on social media. Great stuff. The episode's second story is the meatier one, since it gives Lilith the opportunity to once again spend some time borrowing her dear descendant's body for a joy ride. This whole bit is one of those exemplary occasions where DGND is just flinging little bits of backstory and character development like they were falling out of the back of a truck, and you hardly notice because you're too busy giggling at the hilariously extra outfit that Lilith coerced Shamiko into buying for the upcoming frenemy date with Momo. The whole reason that Momo and Shamiko decide to take pity on Lilith at all is because they learn that, for most of the 2,000 years she has spent trapped in that icon that looks distractingly like a sex toy, the poor demon was completely isolated and alone. It wasn't until Shamiko was born that she began to regain enough power to even glimpse the outside world, and even then, it took a full decade for Lilith to make contact. Even Momo, whose favorite hobby is yeeting Lilith's statue to parts unknown, concedes that the ancient devil at least deserves one afternoon out…under Momo's strict supervision, of course.  If I'm being honest, the girls' day out isn't the funniest that DGND has ever been, but it's still a good time, and the story reaches a sweet conclusion once Momo finally lets Lilith take a break from exercise routines to take a dip in the bath. I'm usually wary whenever any show with a predominately young and female cast goes to a bathhouse, but DGND was thankfully pretty tasteful with all of the scenes that the girls spend in the buff. No leering camera angles, no conspicuous feet shots, no cringe-inducing bits where the girls start rubbing each other's boobs like they were characters in a very problematic Penthouse letter. Sure, Lilith has fun at Momo's expense when it seems like the magical girl is too shy to get naked in front of the obnoxious demon that is possessing the body of her best friend and probable crush, but the show doesn't get weird with it.  Instead, we learn that Momo's body is covered in scars from battles that she still doesn't feel comfortable opening up about, and that Lilith is actually deathly afraid of the dark. She specifically notes that, when she was trapped in the statue to begin with, she hadn't even mastered her magic powers yet, so she spent years in a literal void of nothingness until she could bring a spark of light back into her life. It's a deeply sad thing to learn about this haughty and arrogant character, and it explains an awful lot about her current demeanor.   And yeah, Momo does eventually use this rare moment of vulnerability to ruthlessly blackmail Lilith into behaving, but I don't think Shamiko is wrong when she believes that the two have genuinely come to understand each other better. That's The Demon Girl Next Door in a nutshell for you: Come for the funny jokes, and stay for the sincere and surprisingly deep story of a bunch of lonely girls that are doing their best to learn how to love and be loved again.

The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2 Episode 3  by James Beckett, Apr 24th 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.3             I'm going to do my best to keep this particular note of praise from getting old in the coming weeks, since it has consistently been one of The Demon Girl Next Door's greatest strengths, but I just really love the completely casual and effortless way that the show slips its character development and important background information into its jokey-joke scripts and slice-of-life pacing. It makes watching and rewatching the series a very rewarding experience, because the smallest of off-the-cuff lines could have very significant implications for the overall story. This is a gag anime about a really dumb but sweet demon girl who wants nothing more than to make the magical girl next door smile. It doesn't have to worry about worldbuilding or character arcs, and yet it goes the extra mile all the same.  Before we get to that, though, we have a pretty funny sketch that showcases just how terrible Shamiko is at fairly standard things, such as using the internet. It's getting increasingly more difficult these days for me to believe that any Zoomer living in a tech-savvy society would be so utterly baffled by the most basic of technological concepts, especially when it comes to social media, no matter how cosmically impoverished they may be. Is Shamiko's cluelessness a character cliché that might not totally work here in the 2020s, or is it a clue that has larger implications about the differences between our world and this magic-infused alternate universe??? Eh, it's probably that first option, but it's always fun to play along with the “Guess Which Innocuous Detail is Secretly Super Important to the Lore™” game. Besides, even if it is a little silly to have Shamiko be so comically underprepared to even log on to a single website, this is a silly show, and there are a bunch of those small humorous flourishes that DGND is so good at, like Momo's cute presentation sign, or the fact that Kyo assumes that making social media friends are essentially equivalent to soldiers being recruited into her big sister's evil army. Plus, you know my heart melted when Shamiko had to use her Whatchamacallit Wand to ask Momo to be friends on social media. Great stuff. The episode's second story is the meatier one, since it gives Lilith the opportunity to once again spend some time borrowing her dear descendant's body for a joy ride. This whole bit is one of those exemplary occasions where DGND is just flinging little bits of backstory and character development like they were falling out of the back of a truck, and you hardly notice because you're too busy giggling at the hilariously extra outfit that Lilith coerced Shamiko into buying for the upcoming frenemy date with Momo. The whole reason that Momo and Shamiko decide to take pity on Lilith at all is because they learn that, for most of the 2,000 years she has spent trapped in that icon that looks distractingly like a sex toy, the poor demon was completely isolated and alone. It wasn't until Shamiko was born that she began to regain enough power to even glimpse the outside world, and even then, it took a full decade for Lilith to make contact. Even Momo, whose favorite hobby is yeeting Lilith's statue to parts unknown, concedes that the ancient devil at least deserves one afternoon out…under Momo's strict supervision, of course.  If I'm being honest, the girls' day out isn't the funniest that DGND has ever been, but it's still a good time, and the story reaches a sweet conclusion once Momo finally lets Lilith take a break from exercise routines to take a dip in the bath. I'm usually wary whenever any show with a predominately young and female cast goes to a bathhouse, but DGND was thankfully pretty tasteful with all of the scenes that the girls spend in the buff. No leering camera angles, no conspicuous feet shots, no cringe-inducing bits where the girls start rubbing each other's boobs like they were characters in a very problematic Penthouse letter. Sure, Lilith has fun at Momo's expense when it seems like the magical girl is too shy to get naked in front of the obnoxious demon that is possessing the body of her best friend and probable crush, but the show doesn't get weird with it.  Instead, we learn that Momo's body is covered in scars from battles that she still doesn't feel comfortable opening up about, and that Lilith is actually deathly afraid of the dark. She specifically notes that, when she was trapped in the statue to begin with, she hadn't even mastered her magic powers yet, so she spent years in a literal void of nothingness until she could bring a spark of light back into her life. It's a deeply sad thing to learn about this haughty and arrogant character, and it explains an awful lot about her current demeanor.   And yeah, Momo does eventually use this rare moment of vulnerability to ruthlessly blackmail Lilith into behaving, but I don't think Shamiko is wrong when she believes that the two have genuinely come to understand each other better. That's The Demon Girl Next Door in a nutshell for you: Come for the funny jokes, and stay for the sincere and surprisingly deep story of a bunch of lonely girls that are doing their best to learn how to love and be loved again.

The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2 Episode 3  by James Beckett, Apr 24th 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.3             I'm going to do my best to keep this particular note of praise from getting old in the coming weeks, since it has consistently been one of The Demon Girl Next Door's greatest strengths, but I just really love the completely casual and effortless way that the show slips its character development and important background information into its jokey-joke scripts and slice-of-life pacing. It makes watching and rewatching the series a very rewarding experience, because the smallest of off-the-cuff lines could have very significant implications for the overall story. This is a gag anime about a really dumb but sweet demon girl who wants nothing more than to make the magical girl next door smile. It doesn't have to worry about worldbuilding or character arcs, and yet it goes the extra mile all the same.  Before we get to that, though, we have a pretty funny sketch that showcases just how terrible Shamiko is at fairly standard things, such as using the internet. It's getting increasingly more difficult these days for me to believe that any Zoomer living in a tech-savvy society would be so utterly baffled by the most basic of technological concepts, especially when it comes to social media, no matter how cosmically impoverished they may be. Is Shamiko's cluelessness a character cliché that might not totally work here in the 2020s, or is it a clue that has larger implications about the differences between our world and this magic-infused alternate universe??? Eh, it's probably that first option, but it's always fun to play along with the “Guess Which Innocuous Detail is Secretly Super Important to the Lore™” game. Besides, even if it is a little silly to have Shamiko be so comically underprepared to even log on to a single website, this is a silly show, and there are a bunch of those small humorous flourishes that DGND is so good at, like Momo's cute presentation sign, or the fact that Kyo assumes that making social media friends are essentially equivalent to soldiers being recruited into her big sister's evil army. Plus, you know my heart melted when Shamiko had to use her Whatchamacallit Wand to ask Momo to be friends on social media. Great stuff. The episode's second story is the meatier one, since it gives Lilith the opportunity to once again spend some time borrowing her dear descendant's body for a joy ride. This whole bit is one of those exemplary occasions where DGND is just flinging little bits of backstory and character development like they were falling out of the back of a truck, and you hardly notice because you're too busy giggling at the hilariously extra outfit that Lilith coerced Shamiko into buying for the upcoming frenemy date with Momo. The whole reason that Momo and Shamiko decide to take pity on Lilith at all is because they learn that, for most of the 2,000 years she has spent trapped in that icon that looks distractingly like a sex toy, the poor demon was completely isolated and alone. It wasn't until Shamiko was born that she began to regain enough power to even glimpse the outside world, and even then, it took a full decade for Lilith to make contact. Even Momo, whose favorite hobby is yeeting Lilith's statue to parts unknown, concedes that the ancient devil at least deserves one afternoon out…under Momo's strict supervision, of course.  If I'm being honest, the girls' day out isn't the funniest that DGND has ever been, but it's still a good time, and the story reaches a sweet conclusion once Momo finally lets Lilith take a break from exercise routines to take a dip in the bath. I'm usually wary whenever any show with a predominately young and female cast goes to a bathhouse, but DGND was thankfully pretty tasteful with all of the scenes that the girls spend in the buff. No leering camera angles, no conspicuous feet shots, no cringe-inducing bits where the girls start rubbing each other's boobs like they were characters in a very problematic Penthouse letter. Sure, Lilith has fun at Momo's expense when it seems like the magical girl is too shy to get naked in front of the obnoxious demon that is possessing the body of her best friend and probable crush, but the show doesn't get weird with it.  Instead, we learn that Momo's body is covered in scars from battles that she still doesn't feel comfortable opening up about, and that Lilith is actually deathly afraid of the dark. She specifically notes that, when she was trapped in the statue to begin with, she hadn't even mastered her magic powers yet, so she spent years in a literal void of nothingness until she could bring a spark of light back into her life. It's a deeply sad thing to learn about this haughty and arrogant character, and it explains an awful lot about her current demeanor.   And yeah, Momo does eventually use this rare moment of vulnerability to ruthlessly blackmail Lilith into behaving, but I don't think Shamiko is wrong when she believes that the two have genuinely come to understand each other better. That's The Demon Girl Next Door in a nutshell for you: Come for the funny jokes, and stay for the sincere and surprisingly deep story of a bunch of lonely girls that are doing their best to learn how to love and be loved again.

The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2 Episode 3  by James Beckett, Apr 24th 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.3             I'm going to do my best to keep this particular note of praise from getting old in the coming weeks, since it has consistently been one of The Demon Girl Next Door's greatest strengths, but I just really love the completely casual and effortless way that the show slips its character development and important background information into its jokey-joke scripts and slice-of-life pacing. It makes watching and rewatching the series a very rewarding experience, because the smallest of off-the-cuff lines could have very significant implications for the overall story. This is a gag anime about a really dumb but sweet demon girl who wants nothing more than to make the magical girl next door smile. It doesn't have to worry about worldbuilding or character arcs, and yet it goes the extra mile all the same.  Before we get to that, though, we have a pretty funny sketch that showcases just how terrible Shamiko is at fairly standard things, such as using the internet. It's getting increasingly more difficult these days for me to believe that any Zoomer living in a tech-savvy society would be so utterly baffled by the most basic of technological concepts, especially when it comes to social media, no matter how cosmically impoverished they may be. Is Shamiko's cluelessness a character cliché that might not totally work here in the 2020s, or is it a clue that has larger implications about the differences between our world and this magic-infused alternate universe??? Eh, it's probably that first option, but it's always fun to play along with the “Guess Which Innocuous Detail is Secretly Super Important to the Lore™” game. Besides, even if it is a little silly to have Shamiko be so comically underprepared to even log on to a single website, this is a silly show, and there are a bunch of those small humorous flourishes that DGND is so good at, like Momo's cute presentation sign, or the fact that Kyo assumes that making social media friends are essentially equivalent to soldiers being recruited into her big sister's evil army. Plus, you know my heart melted when Shamiko had to use her Whatchamacallit Wand to ask Momo to be friends on social media. Great stuff. The episode's second story is the meatier one, since it gives Lilith the opportunity to once again spend some time borrowing her dear descendant's body for a joy ride. This whole bit is one of those exemplary occasions where DGND is just flinging little bits of backstory and character development like they were falling out of the back of a truck, and you hardly notice because you're too busy giggling at the hilariously extra outfit that Lilith coerced Shamiko into buying for the upcoming frenemy date with Momo. The whole reason that Momo and Shamiko decide to take pity on Lilith at all is because they learn that, for most of the 2,000 years she has spent trapped in that icon that looks distractingly like a sex toy, the poor demon was completely isolated and alone. It wasn't until Shamiko was born that she began to regain enough power to even glimpse the outside world, and even then, it took a full decade for Lilith to make contact. Even Momo, whose favorite hobby is yeeting Lilith's statue to parts unknown, concedes that the ancient devil at least deserves one afternoon out…under Momo's strict supervision, of course.  If I'm being honest, the girls' day out isn't the funniest that DGND has ever been, but it's still a good time, and the story reaches a sweet conclusion once Momo finally lets Lilith take a break from exercise routines to take a dip in the bath. I'm usually wary whenever any show with a predominately young and female cast goes to a bathhouse, but DGND was thankfully pretty tasteful with all of the scenes that the girls spend in the buff. No leering camera angles, no conspicuous feet shots, no cringe-inducing bits where the girls start rubbing each other's boobs like they were characters in a very problematic Penthouse letter. Sure, Lilith has fun at Momo's expense when it seems like the magical girl is too shy to get naked in front of the obnoxious demon that is possessing the body of her best friend and probable crush, but the show doesn't get weird with it.  Instead, we learn that Momo's body is covered in scars from battles that she still doesn't feel comfortable opening up about, and that Lilith is actually deathly afraid of the dark. She specifically notes that, when she was trapped in the statue to begin with, she hadn't even mastered her magic powers yet, so she spent years in a literal void of nothingness until she could bring a spark of light back into her life. It's a deeply sad thing to learn about this haughty and arrogant character, and it explains an awful lot about her current demeanor.   And yeah, Momo does eventually use this rare moment of vulnerability to ruthlessly blackmail Lilith into behaving, but I don't think Shamiko is wrong when she believes that the two have genuinely come to understand each other better. That's The Demon Girl Next Door in a nutshell for you: Come for the funny jokes, and stay for the sincere and surprisingly deep story of a bunch of lonely girls that are doing their best to learn how to love and be loved again.

This whole bit is one of those exemplary occasions where DGND is just flinging little bits of backstory and character development like they were falling out of the back of a truck, and you hardly notice because you're too busy giggling at the hilariously extra outfit that Lilith coerced Shamiko into buying for the upcoming frenemy date with Momo. The whole reason that Momo and Shamiko decide to take pity on Lilith at all is because they learn that, for most of the 2,000 years she has spent trapped in that icon that looks distractingly like a sex toy, the poor demon was completely isolated and alone. It wasn't until Shamiko was born that she began to regain enough power to even glimpse the outside world, and even then, it took a full decade for Lilith to make contact. Even Momo, whose favorite hobby is yeeting Lilith's statue to parts unknown, concedes that the ancient devil at least deserves one afternoon out…under Momo's strict supervision, of course.  If I'm being honest, the girls' day out isn't the funniest that DGND has ever been, but it's still a good time, and the story reaches a sweet conclusion once Momo finally lets Lilith take a break from exercise routines to take a dip in the bath. I'm usually wary whenever any show with a predominately young and female cast goes to a bathhouse, but DGND was thankfully pretty tasteful with all of the scenes that the girls spend in the buff. No leering camera angles, no conspicuous feet shots, no cringe-inducing bits where the girls start rubbing each other's boobs like they were characters in a very problematic Penthouse letter. Sure, Lilith has fun at Momo's expense when it seems like the magical girl is too shy to get naked in front of the obnoxious demon that is possessing the body of her best friend and probable crush, but the show doesn't get weird with it.  Instead, we learn that Momo's body is covered in scars from battles that she still doesn't feel comfortable opening up about, and that Lilith is actually deathly afraid of the dark. She specifically notes that, when she was trapped in the statue to begin with, she hadn't even mastered her magic powers yet, so she spent years in a literal void of nothingness until she could bring a spark of light back into her life. It's a deeply sad thing to learn about this haughty and arrogant character, and it explains an awful lot about her current demeanor.   And yeah, Momo does eventually use this rare moment of vulnerability to ruthlessly blackmail Lilith into behaving, but I don't think Shamiko is wrong when she believes that the two have genuinely come to understand each other better. That's The Demon Girl Next Door in a nutshell for you: Come for the funny jokes, and stay for the sincere and surprisingly deep story of a bunch of lonely girls that are doing their best to learn how to love and be loved again.

Community score: 4.3             I'm going to do my best to keep this particular note of praise from getting old in the coming weeks, since it has consistently been one of The Demon Girl Next Door's greatest strengths, but I just really love the completely casual and effortless way that the show slips its character development and important background information into its jokey-joke scripts and slice-of-life pacing. It makes watching and rewatching the series a very rewarding experience, because the smallest of off-the-cuff lines could have very significant implications for the overall story. This is a gag anime about a really dumb but sweet demon girl who wants nothing more than to make the magical girl next door smile. It doesn't have to worry about worldbuilding or character arcs, and yet it goes the extra mile all the same.  Before we get to that, though, we have a pretty funny sketch that showcases just how terrible Shamiko is at fairly standard things, such as using the internet. It's getting increasingly more difficult these days for me to believe that any Zoomer living in a tech-savvy society would be so utterly baffled by the most basic of technological concepts, especially when it comes to social media, no matter how cosmically impoverished they may be. Is Shamiko's cluelessness a character cliché that might not totally work here in the 2020s, or is it a clue that has larger implications about the differences between our world and this magic-infused alternate universe??? Eh, it's probably that first option, but it's always fun to play along with the “Guess Which Innocuous Detail is Secretly Super Important to the Lore™” game. Besides, even if it is a little silly to have Shamiko be so comically underprepared to even log on to a single website, this is a silly show, and there are a bunch of those small humorous flourishes that DGND is so good at, like Momo's cute presentation sign, or the fact that Kyo assumes that making social media friends are essentially equivalent to soldiers being recruited into her big sister's evil army.

I'm Quitting Heroing Episodes 1-3  by Grant Jones, Apr 25th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7            I'm Quitting Heroing presents an interesting twist to the standard adventuring hero formula. Our lead Leo is a powerful warrior and spellcaster who, after defeating the demon queen Echidna, didn't receive the warm welcome he had anticipated. Instead, he gets run out of town and there are even assassins sent out after him. Now he is applying to be a part of the demon queen's army – that is, if he can get past the interview step.    The premiere mostly centers around Leo and the four generals of Echidna's demon army. We get a bit of background from each of them and how they are defeated by Leo, as well as a few flashbacks to Leo's adventuring life and what brought him to this point. In the end, the generals agree that he might be able to help revitalize the demon army and get things back on track, and decided to put in a good word for him.    I'm mixed on this first episode. On the one hand, I'm glad we're in an actual fantasy world and not an isekai situation (so far as I am aware), which is a nice change of pace. The comedy is pretty solid and gave me more than a few chuckles throughout his episode. The framing around the opening sequence was strong, with Leo cutting through the flashback and the ominous string music being notable highlights. Similarly, the animation is perfectly fine and the character designs are varied enough to be interesting.    There are a few stumbling blocks though. Leo is very self-absorbed and the “I am so amazing why is everyone else so terrible” setup around him is… not exactly framed as a flaw. Hopefully this ends up being something he has to overcome or grow away from in the future, because otherwise, this episode is almost entirely about how great Leo is and everyone basically agreeing that yes, Leo is indeed great (except for the people of the kingdom who did not like him because he was just too great at demon-slaying).  I also am not a huge fan of Lily and the sequences involving her.    Here's hoping the show leans into the stronger comedy going forward.    Rating:                         How would you rate episode 2 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.5            Episode two revolves around that most critical of topics: boobies delegation. I'm only half-joking, as the episode is indeed mildly thirsty, with a lot of random guffaws about boobs and kisses and so forth. That said, they are honestly pretty tame as far as these things go, and simply functioned to fill air-time without adding all that much in return.    The real meat of the episode was about prioritization and efficiency in kingdom management. Leo spends most of the episode helping Shutina bring the mana reactors for the fortress back online, alongside other administrative tasks. The idea about the recharging talisman and a work crew to keep them rolling is, well, pretty basic division of labor stuff. I'm not sure how to feel about the overall message of “Hey, have you ever heard of delegating tasks before?” On the one hand, one would reasonably assume Shutina to have some experience with delegation – she is one of four generals in a vast army after all. Then again, the demon army lost, so perhaps these inefficiencies have been there all along. In any case, it was too low-stakes a personal hurdle to be engaging, partly because it's not clear why the incredibly basic solution to that was framed as such a brilliant decision from Leo. If there has ever been a task, someone somewhere has to have thought “There has to be a way for me not to have to do this.”    The best part of the episode by far was Leo trying to figure out his rebrand. Testing out names, making cool armor, doing voice modulation stuff, and asking other people if his new title sounds cool are all great bits of characterization. It would be a nice character wrinkle to have Leo be much better than others in terms of intelligence and combat prowess but much more awkward and unsure of himself in areas like branding and communication. We'll see if they stick with that in future episodes.    Rating:                         How would you rate episode 3 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7            Hey, this Lily episode surprisingly turned out pretty all right. There were a few undertones that I could do without, but overall it had a good heart and *gasp* a lesson for Leo.    The island setting is an interesting change from our previous generic fantasy locale.  Leo standing on the beach in full edgelord armor makes for a pretty funny image, whether it was meant to be or not. The general vibe of the episode is also good, with everyone working together and Leo being a bit out of his depth.    The comedic hook of the episode's plot has to do with Leo challenging Lily to help her mature. Leo is clearly underestimating Lily, and watching her upend his expectations at every instance, whether due to her innate power from her Fenrir form or her general resourcefulness, is such a great payoff. By the end of the episode, Leo even admits that he misjudged her and went through a whole lot of nonsense when he could have just communicated with her. The entire segment functions as both a great comedic highlight and a good lesson for our hero! Leo concocting these elaborate goofball scenarios all because he doesn't think he can just speak to Lily is something that he does need to learn and grow from.    The lore behind the island chains was a bit of a mess. It was clearly just meant to be a place for lots of Adventure™ but I'm not sure the descriptions meshed all that well. It's supposed to be an unexplored mystery, but if that's the case, why are there countless shipwrecks and entire island populations existing and thriving? Furthermore, this particular island is so well-known to the demon queen's forces that they had pre-existing trade relations with them – relations so vital they can't possible do without them. This also makes the entire crux of last episode about the lack of delegation feel like that much more of a head-scratcher: how exactly is all of this international trade happening without at least some robust logistical structure? But maybe that's analyzing the show too much.    Side note: I think Lily's adorable little drawings are great. Seeing all the happy little monsters cheering is Good Art as far as I'm concerned.

I'm Quitting Heroing Episodes 1-3  by Grant Jones, Apr 25th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7            I'm Quitting Heroing presents an interesting twist to the standard adventuring hero formula. Our lead Leo is a powerful warrior and spellcaster who, after defeating the demon queen Echidna, didn't receive the warm welcome he had anticipated. Instead, he gets run out of town and there are even assassins sent out after him. Now he is applying to be a part of the demon queen's army – that is, if he can get past the interview step.    The premiere mostly centers around Leo and the four generals of Echidna's demon army. We get a bit of background from each of them and how they are defeated by Leo, as well as a few flashbacks to Leo's adventuring life and what brought him to this point. In the end, the generals agree that he might be able to help revitalize the demon army and get things back on track, and decided to put in a good word for him.    I'm mixed on this first episode. On the one hand, I'm glad we're in an actual fantasy world and not an isekai situation (so far as I am aware), which is a nice change of pace. The comedy is pretty solid and gave me more than a few chuckles throughout his episode. The framing around the opening sequence was strong, with Leo cutting through the flashback and the ominous string music being notable highlights. Similarly, the animation is perfectly fine and the character designs are varied enough to be interesting.    There are a few stumbling blocks though. Leo is very self-absorbed and the “I am so amazing why is everyone else so terrible” setup around him is… not exactly framed as a flaw. Hopefully this ends up being something he has to overcome or grow away from in the future, because otherwise, this episode is almost entirely about how great Leo is and everyone basically agreeing that yes, Leo is indeed great (except for the people of the kingdom who did not like him because he was just too great at demon-slaying).  I also am not a huge fan of Lily and the sequences involving her.    Here's hoping the show leans into the stronger comedy going forward.    Rating:                         How would you rate episode 2 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.5            Episode two revolves around that most critical of topics: boobies delegation. I'm only half-joking, as the episode is indeed mildly thirsty, with a lot of random guffaws about boobs and kisses and so forth. That said, they are honestly pretty tame as far as these things go, and simply functioned to fill air-time without adding all that much in return.

I'm not sure how to feel about the overall message of “Hey, have you ever heard of delegating tasks before?” On the one hand, one would reasonably assume Shutina to have some experience with delegation – she is one of four generals in a vast army after all. Then again, the demon army lost, so perhaps these inefficiencies have been there all along. In any case, it was too low-stakes a personal hurdle to be engaging, partly because it's not clear why the incredibly basic solution to that was framed as such a brilliant decision from Leo. If there has ever been a task, someone somewhere has to have thought “There has to be a way for me not to have to do this.”    The best part of the episode by far was Leo trying to figure out his rebrand. Testing out names, making cool armor, doing voice modulation stuff, and asking other people if his new title sounds cool are all great bits of characterization. It would be a nice character wrinkle to have Leo be much better than others in terms of intelligence and combat prowess but much more awkward and unsure of himself in areas like branding and communication. We'll see if they stick with that in future episodes.    Rating:                         How would you rate episode 3 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7            Hey, this Lily episode surprisingly turned out pretty all right. There were a few undertones that I could do without, but overall it had a good heart and *gasp* a lesson for Leo.    The island setting is an interesting change from our previous generic fantasy locale.  Leo standing on the beach in full edgelord armor makes for a pretty funny image, whether it was meant to be or not. The general vibe of the episode is also good, with everyone working together and Leo being a bit out of his depth.    The comedic hook of the episode's plot has to do with Leo challenging Lily to help her mature. Leo is clearly underestimating Lily, and watching her upend his expectations at every instance, whether due to her innate power from her Fenrir form or her general resourcefulness, is such a great payoff. By the end of the episode, Leo even admits that he misjudged her and went through a whole lot of nonsense when he could have just communicated with her. The entire segment functions as both a great comedic highlight and a good lesson for our hero! Leo concocting these elaborate goofball scenarios all because he doesn't think he can just speak to Lily is something that he does need to learn and grow from.    The lore behind the island chains was a bit of a mess. It was clearly just meant to be a place for lots of Adventure™ but I'm not sure the descriptions meshed all that well. It's supposed to be an unexplored mystery, but if that's the case, why are there countless shipwrecks and entire island populations existing and thriving? Furthermore, this particular island is so well-known to the demon queen's forces that they had pre-existing trade relations with them – relations so vital they can't possible do without them. This also makes the entire crux of last episode about the lack of delegation feel like that much more of a head-scratcher: how exactly is all of this international trade happening without at least some robust logistical structure? But maybe that's analyzing the show too much.    Side note: I think Lily's adorable little drawings are great. Seeing all the happy little monsters cheering is Good Art as far as I'm concerned.

Community score: 3.5            Episode two revolves around that most critical of topics: boobies delegation. I'm only half-joking, as the episode is indeed mildly thirsty, with a lot of random guffaws about boobs and kisses and so forth. That said, they are honestly pretty tame as far as these things go, and simply functioned to fill air-time without adding all that much in return.    The real meat of the episode was about prioritization and efficiency in kingdom management. Leo spends most of the episode helping Shutina bring the mana reactors for the fortress back online, alongside other administrative tasks. The idea about the recharging talisman and a work crew to keep them rolling is, well, pretty basic division of labor stuff. I'm not sure how to feel about the overall message of “Hey, have you ever heard of delegating tasks before?” On the one hand, one would reasonably assume Shutina to have some experience with delegation – she is one of four generals in a vast army after all. Then again, the demon army lost, so perhaps these inefficiencies have been there all along. In any case, it was too low-stakes a personal hurdle to be engaging, partly because it's not clear why the incredibly basic solution to that was framed as such a brilliant decision from Leo. If there has ever been a task, someone somewhere has to have thought “There has to be a way for me not to have to do this.”    The best part of the episode by far was Leo trying to figure out his rebrand. Testing out names, making cool armor, doing voice modulation stuff, and asking other people if his new title sounds cool are all great bits of characterization. It would be a nice character wrinkle to have Leo be much better than others in terms of intelligence and combat prowess but much more awkward and unsure of himself in areas like branding and communication. We'll see if they stick with that in future episodes.    Rating:                         How would you rate episode 3 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7            Hey, this Lily episode surprisingly turned out pretty all right. There were a few undertones that I could do without, but overall it had a good heart and *gasp* a lesson for Leo.    The island setting is an interesting change from our previous generic fantasy locale.  Leo standing on the beach in full edgelord armor makes for a pretty funny image, whether it was meant to be or not. The general vibe of the episode is also good, with everyone working together and Leo being a bit out of his depth.    The comedic hook of the episode's plot has to do with Leo challenging Lily to help her mature. Leo is clearly underestimating Lily, and watching her upend his expectations at every instance, whether due to her innate power from her Fenrir form or her general resourcefulness, is such a great payoff. By the end of the episode, Leo even admits that he misjudged her and went through a whole lot of nonsense when he could have just communicated with her. The entire segment functions as both a great comedic highlight and a good lesson for our hero! Leo concocting these elaborate goofball scenarios all because he doesn't think he can just speak to Lily is something that he does need to learn and grow from.    The lore behind the island chains was a bit of a mess. It was clearly just meant to be a place for lots of Adventure™ but I'm not sure the descriptions meshed all that well. It's supposed to be an unexplored mystery, but if that's the case, why are there countless shipwrecks and entire island populations existing and thriving? Furthermore, this particular island is so well-known to the demon queen's forces that they had pre-existing trade relations with them – relations so vital they can't possible do without them. This also makes the entire crux of last episode about the lack of delegation feel like that much more of a head-scratcher: how exactly is all of this international trade happening without at least some robust logistical structure? But maybe that's analyzing the show too much.    Side note: I think Lily's adorable little drawings are great. Seeing all the happy little monsters cheering is Good Art as far as I'm concerned.

I'm Quitting Heroing Episodes 1-3  by Grant Jones, Apr 25th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7            I'm Quitting Heroing presents an interesting twist to the standard adventuring hero formula. Our lead Leo is a powerful warrior and spellcaster who, after defeating the demon queen Echidna, didn't receive the warm welcome he had anticipated. Instead, he gets run out of town and there are even assassins sent out after him. Now he is applying to be a part of the demon queen's army – that is, if he can get past the interview step.    The premiere mostly centers around Leo and the four generals of Echidna's demon army. We get a bit of background from each of them and how they are defeated by Leo, as well as a few flashbacks to Leo's adventuring life and what brought him to this point. In the end, the generals agree that he might be able to help revitalize the demon army and get things back on track, and decided to put in a good word for him.    I'm mixed on this first episode. On the one hand, I'm glad we're in an actual fantasy world and not an isekai situation (so far as I am aware), which is a nice change of pace. The comedy is pretty solid and gave me more than a few chuckles throughout his episode. The framing around the opening sequence was strong, with Leo cutting through the flashback and the ominous string music being notable highlights. Similarly, the animation is perfectly fine and the character designs are varied enough to be interesting.    There are a few stumbling blocks though. Leo is very self-absorbed and the “I am so amazing why is everyone else so terrible” setup around him is… not exactly framed as a flaw. Hopefully this ends up being something he has to overcome or grow away from in the future, because otherwise, this episode is almost entirely about how great Leo is and everyone basically agreeing that yes, Leo is indeed great (except for the people of the kingdom who did not like him because he was just too great at demon-slaying).  I also am not a huge fan of Lily and the sequences involving her.    Here's hoping the show leans into the stronger comedy going forward.    Rating:                         How would you rate episode 2 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.5            Episode two revolves around that most critical of topics: boobies delegation. I'm only half-joking, as the episode is indeed mildly thirsty, with a lot of random guffaws about boobs and kisses and so forth. That said, they are honestly pretty tame as far as these things go, and simply functioned to fill air-time without adding all that much in return.    The real meat of the episode was about prioritization and efficiency in kingdom management. Leo spends most of the episode helping Shutina bring the mana reactors for the fortress back online, alongside other administrative tasks. The idea about the recharging talisman and a work crew to keep them rolling is, well, pretty basic division of labor stuff. I'm not sure how to feel about the overall message of “Hey, have you ever heard of delegating tasks before?” On the one hand, one would reasonably assume Shutina to have some experience with delegation – she is one of four generals in a vast army after all. Then again, the demon army lost, so perhaps these inefficiencies have been there all along. In any case, it was too low-stakes a personal hurdle to be engaging, partly because it's not clear why the incredibly basic solution to that was framed as such a brilliant decision from Leo. If there has ever been a task, someone somewhere has to have thought “There has to be a way for me not to have to do this.”    The best part of the episode by far was Leo trying to figure out his rebrand. Testing out names, making cool armor, doing voice modulation stuff, and asking other people if his new title sounds cool are all great bits of characterization. It would be a nice character wrinkle to have Leo be much better than others in terms of intelligence and combat prowess but much more awkward and unsure of himself in areas like branding and communication.

When Nazuna invites Ko to spend the night at her place in an abandoned building, he's stoked! But then he awakens to kisses on his neck with a little too much bite to them... Is it just the delicious taste of his blood that makes her meet him night after night for late-night adventures, conversation and...naps? Or something else? Then, when a cute girl from Yamori's past shows up and competes for his attention, his budding relationship with the undead is put to the test!

The website unveiled a promotional video and visual that highlight Seri:        The cast includes:   Gen Sato as Kо̄ Yamori   Sora Amamiya as Nazuna Nanakusa   Yumiri Hanamori as Akira Asai    The anime will premiere in Fuji TV's Noitamina programming block in July.

It describes the manga:    Nanakusa is a vampire. That's okay with human Ko. He wants to be one too. But transformation doesn't come that easily...   When Nazuna invites Ko to spend the night at her place in an abandoned building, he's stoked! But then he awakens to kisses on his neck with a little too much bite to them... Is it just the delicious taste of his blood that makes her meet him night after night for late-night adventures, conversation and...naps? Or something else? Then, when a cute girl from Yamori's past shows up and competes for his attention, his budding relationship with the undead is put to the test!    Kotoyama (Dagashi Kashi) launched the Call of the Night manga in Weekly Shonen Sunday in August 2019. Shogakukan published the 10th compiled book volume on February 18.

Interest Singer, Voice Actress Shoko Nakagawa Fails Astronaut Application   posted on 2022-04-26 02:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         2,266 out of 4,127 individuals passed the first level of screening    Last month, voice actress and singer Shoko Nakagawa revealed that she applied to be an astronaut for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Unfortunately, she made a follow-up announcement on Friday saying that she failed to pass the first level of screening. Nevertheless, she remarked ""Oh well!"" and said that her dream of going to space is unchanged.    2,266 out of 4,127 individuals passed the first level of screening. It is the first time in 13 years since JAXA last opened astronaut applications.    Nakagawa has previously said that her dream is to become someone who has visited both outer space and the ocean depths, referencing how in 2009, she dived 5,200 meters below sea level in a manned submersible.    Nakagawa (also known as ""Shokotan"") is best known as a singer, performing the theme song for such anime as Gurren Lagann, Star Blazers 2199, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Punch Line, and numerous Pokémon films. She has also guest-starred in numerous Pokémon installments and has hosted the ongoing weekly children's variety show Pokémon no Uchi Atsumaru? (Meet Up at the Pokémon House?) for over six years.

Interest Singer, Voice Actress Shoko Nakagawa Fails Astronaut Application   posted on 2022-04-26 02:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         2,266 out of 4,127 individuals passed the first level of screening    Last month, voice actress and singer Shoko Nakagawa revealed that she applied to be an astronaut for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Unfortunately, she made a follow-up announcement on Friday saying that she failed to pass the first level of screening. Nevertheless, she remarked ""Oh well!"" and said that her dream of going to space is unchanged.    2,266 out of 4,127 individuals passed the first level of screening. It is the first time in 13 years since JAXA last opened astronaut applications.    Nakagawa has previously said that her dream is to become someone who has visited both outer space and the ocean depths, referencing how in 2009, she dived 5,200 meters below sea level in a manned submersible.    Nakagawa (also known as ""Shokotan"") is best known as a singer, performing the theme song for such anime as Gurren Lagann, Star Blazers 2199, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Punch Line, and numerous Pokémon films. She has also guest-starred in numerous Pokémon installments and has hosted the ongoing weekly children's variety show Pokémon no Uchi Atsumaru? (Meet Up at the Pokémon House?) for over six years.

The Best Light Novels With Horny Energy   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 25th 2022          Not long ago, I wrote about light novels with shonen manga energy. Now I'm back with a (mostly new) list of light novel recommendations! The theme this time is “horny.” Many light novels, even of the non-pornographic variety, contain at least some degree of titillating fanservice, so there's no shortage of qualifying titles. But that also means I could be extra discerning with my choices this time.    A quick disclaimer before I get into the list: although none of these titles are porn, I do recommend that you be at least over 18 before you read them. Also, a number of these picks depict sensitive content such as sexual assault, incest, and age gaps. This is not a list specifically focused on healthy or ideal romantic relationships, but rather interesting stories with sexuality as a prominent theme.    Beast † Blood     I really wanted this list to include at least one example of smutty romance for women, but the market for female-oriented light novels in English is still pretty “clean” at the moment… except for Beast † Blood. It starts with an attempted rape scene and doesn't lighten up from there, telling a dark sci-fi thriller story about drugs, crime, and fantasy racism.    In the sex department, it's all about the classic “Beauty and the Beast” romance trope. Much of the focus is on unraveling the mindset of the dark and brooding male protagonist, who struggles with his carnal desires even though the heroine is more than willing to shag him. By the end of the book, you're just begging the guy to admit “I'm horny” instead of torturing himself, but it's what makes the inevitable moment of release that much more cathartic.    High School DxD     Believe it or not, High School DxD is one of the tamer titles on this list. Despite the anime's reputation for raunchiness, the novel counterpart shows significantly less boobs. One of the biggest frustrations around this series over the long term is that, despite the constantly escalating action, the sexual content doesn't scale up proportionally. For all the teases and glimpses of nudity, Issei never gets more intimate with the girls.    However, that's not to say that this series isn't driven by horniness to the core. Issei's sex drive is baked into his motivation, and so, too, is his fear of intimacy after his failed relationship with Yuma. For all the fantasy elements, it's a relatable portrait of teenage male desires and insecurities. It also helps that the girls are both hot and likable as characters. There's a good reason this series is regarded as the cream of the crop among ecchi-focused titles.    Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension     In the real world, mixed bathing onsens have a poor rep among young people and are in steep decline, but in a fantasy world setting, none of that cultural baggage matters. It all comes down to individual consent: Toya wants to get in the bath with girls, but only if they want to do it with him.    Despite its obscurity and stalled publication status, Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension was the first light novel I thought of for this list because the way it deals with sexual situations is genuinely charming. What really stands out about the bath scenes is the curiosity with which boys and girls compare each other's bodies. There's obviously a degree of arousal involved, but there's something to be said for this kind of innocent fascination with other people's bodies. It's an aspect of physical intimacy that feels underrepresented in media.    JK Haru is a Sex Worker in Another World     A bit of context around JK Haru's publication: the popular web novel site Shо̄setsuka ni Narо̄, where many of the so-called “isekai” novels spawned from, has two R-18 offshoot sites: Nocturne, which is for men, and Moonlight, for women. JK Haru was posted on Moonlight, but according to the author's notes, it was written as a commentary on the male sex fantasies posted on Nocturne. The starting point of the novel was “How would a woman feel, being transplanted into a fantasy world that's shallowly structured around male desires?”    The result is a surprisingly varied picture of the life of a sex worker and one of the more fascinating isekai narratives in general. Although there are scenarios that seem directly pulled from a rape fetish manga, JK Haru is also filled with moments of joy and female camaraderie. The characters spend just as much time outside the brothel as in it, living their fullest lives one day at a time. Even if it's not a story about solving the evils of the world, it's a deeply humbling experience to read.    The Ideal Sponger Life     The Ideal Sponger Life has the horniest premise for a book that's so deeply immersed in fantasy realpolitik: a man is summoned to another world for the explicit purpose of impregnating a hot queen. Since she wants to retain political power after giving birth, she's hoping the guy will quietly sit around without making a nuisance of himself. It's the ideal male and female fantasy!    Though the book isn't actually all that horny in practice. It goes into exacting detail about all sorts of mundane obscurities, and whenever the subject of sex does come up, it's discussed in a down-to-earth manner. Even if it's not a lurid kind of fantasy, however, the frank and naturalistic way the characters navigate their desires and talk about sex is absolutely appealing in its own way. You can tell that Zenjiro and Aura are an intimate couple without it ever needing to be explicit. Sex is a regular and ever-present aspect of their lives.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex     Arguably the tamest example on this list, My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is nothing like Domestic Girlfriend. The stepsiblings in this novel don't have sex, and there's no hot teacher in the house to complicate the drama either. But my gosh, the sexual tension is palpable. Because of their past history together, Mizuto and Yume have chemistry from the get-go, and some of the “will they or won't they?” moments are genuinely spicy.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is particularly interesting because it switches POV between the two main characters. And between the two, the girl is definitely the hornier one, in spite of her desperate attempts to maintain a preppy image. Reading the ecchi shenanigans partly through Yume's point of view also makes those scenes more titillating because the constant reminder of mutual attraction heightens the tension. And the way complicated feelings can linger even after the sexy situation is over makes the relationship feel all the more real.    No Game, No Life     The emphasis of No Game, No Life is on games and thrills, but it can't be denied that sexual situations make up a big part of the story, with every volume getting at least one colour spread showing the girls buck naked. It's risque enough for some volumes to get banned from Australia, in large part because of how prominent the prepubescent Shiro is in those illustrations.    I have mixed feelings about the lolicon aspect because the nudity is ridiculous fun in its narrative context. In No Game, No Life, high-stakes gambits are juxtaposed with bawdy fanservice, sometimes in the very same scene. An example of this which got adapted in the anime is the shiritori game with Jibril. The nudity is utterly memorable because the entire thing is a mind game; although the two characters are relaxed at this point, every word they utter is only one step removed from a frenetic rush towards death. Bonus points to Sora for having the foresight to censor out the nipples ahead of time.    Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend?     Another light novel with a risque theme, Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend? tackles the taboo of age-gap relationships. In this case, it's about the romance between a 27-year-old office worker lady and a 15-year-old high school boy. Just looking at those ages, you'd immediately assume this romance is cursed, but it helps in this case that it's more com than rom at heart. The main characters get into a relationship early, and the rest of the series is more about navigating the inevitable shenanigans.    Sex comedy is a mainstay in this series, and it works because of how it balances the two characters' perspectives. They're both horny, which is exemplified in how floridly they describe each other's appearances, and the plot consistently puts them in situations that test their restraint. At the same time, they're not emotionally ready to go through with the act, and they're also very conscious about not violating personal boundaries. It's all very sweet and vanilla, perhaps because the premise is so transgressive.    Monogatari     Monogatari is a perennial classic because it's one of the smartest novels to talk so endlessly about sex and libido without ever getting to the point. Some scenes are iconic, like when Araragi spends several pages just describing Hanekawa's panties in Kizumonogatari, an experience that inspires profound thought in him.    I used to find this kind of pseudo-intellectual approach irritating, but nowadays, I can see the fun in winking to the reader like that. If sex is on a lot of people's minds regardless of class or level of education, then it's natural for it to become the subject of “smart person dumb jokes.” Most of the conversations in Monogatari are pure sophistry, but that's kind of the point. Sex is really more of a vehicle of understanding the characters' outlooks.    Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation     If you watched Mushoku Tensei's anime adaptation last year, you've probably made up your own mind about how Rudeus's lolicon interests are portrayed in the early parts of the series. Although I have mixed feelings about the writing in those early days, when I look back on the series as a whole, I think sexuality is an indispensable part of the world. Almost every character, not just Rudeus, has a sexual side that is relevant to their motivations.    There's a lot of talk about whether Mushoku Tensei is only an interesting fantasy series in spite of its focus on sex, but I can't help but disagree—this series would be worse if it didn't have sex as a sub theme. Besides making the individual characters feel like real people with real foibles, it represents a wide spectrum of sexual interests and kinks without overt moralizing, in a way that paints a complicated picture of humanity as a whole. Even if it's not necessarily the approach I would want to see every story take, I appreciate that there is a story like this one out there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

The Best Light Novels With Horny Energy   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 25th 2022          Not long ago, I wrote about light novels with shonen manga energy. Now I'm back with a (mostly new) list of light novel recommendations! The theme this time is “horny.” Many light novels, even of the non-pornographic variety, contain at least some degree of titillating fanservice, so there's no shortage of qualifying titles. But that also means I could be extra discerning with my choices this time.    A quick disclaimer before I get into the list: although none of these titles are porn, I do recommend that you be at least over 18 before you read them. Also, a number of these picks depict sensitive content such as sexual assault, incest, and age gaps. This is not a list specifically focused on healthy or ideal romantic relationships, but rather interesting stories with sexuality as a prominent theme.    Beast † Blood     I really wanted this list to include at least one example of smutty romance for women, but the market for female-oriented light novels in English is still pretty “clean” at the moment… except for Beast † Blood. It starts with an attempted rape scene and doesn't lighten up from there, telling a dark sci-fi thriller story about drugs, crime, and fantasy racism.    In the sex department, it's all about the classic “Beauty and the Beast” romance trope. Much of the focus is on unraveling the mindset of the dark and brooding male protagonist, who struggles with his carnal desires even though the heroine is more than willing to shag him. By the end of the book, you're just begging the guy to admit “I'm horny” instead of torturing himself, but it's what makes the inevitable moment of release that much more cathartic.    High School DxD     Believe it or not, High School DxD is one of the tamer titles on this list. Despite the anime's reputation for raunchiness, the novel counterpart shows significantly less boobs. One of the biggest frustrations around this series over the long term is that, despite the constantly escalating action, the sexual content doesn't scale up proportionally. For all the teases and glimpses of nudity, Issei never gets more intimate with the girls.    However, that's not to say that this series isn't driven by horniness to the core. Issei's sex drive is baked into his motivation, and so, too, is his fear of intimacy after his failed relationship with Yuma. For all the fantasy elements, it's a relatable portrait of teenage male desires and insecurities. It also helps that the girls are both hot and likable as characters. There's a good reason this series is regarded as the cream of the crop among ecchi-focused titles.    Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension     In the real world, mixed bathing onsens have a poor rep among young people and are in steep decline, but in a fantasy world setting, none of that cultural baggage matters. It all comes down to individual consent: Toya wants to get in the bath with girls, but only if they want to do it with him.    Despite its obscurity and stalled publication status, Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension was the first light novel I thought of for this list because the way it deals with sexual situations is genuinely charming. What really stands out about the bath scenes is the curiosity with which boys and girls compare each other's bodies. There's obviously a degree of arousal involved, but there's something to be said for this kind of innocent fascination with other people's bodies. It's an aspect of physical intimacy that feels underrepresented in media.    JK Haru is a Sex Worker in Another World     A bit of context around JK Haru's publication: the popular web novel site Shо̄setsuka ni Narо̄, where many of the so-called “isekai” novels spawned from, has two R-18 offshoot sites: Nocturne, which is for men, and Moonlight, for women. JK Haru was posted on Moonlight, but according to the author's notes, it was written as a commentary on the male sex fantasies posted on Nocturne. The starting point of the novel was “How would a woman feel, being transplanted into a fantasy world that's shallowly structured around male desires?”    The result is a surprisingly varied picture of the life of a sex worker and one of the more fascinating isekai narratives in general. Although there are scenarios that seem directly pulled from a rape fetish manga, JK Haru is also filled with moments of joy and female camaraderie. The characters spend just as much time outside the brothel as in it, living their fullest lives one day at a time. Even if it's not a story about solving the evils of the world, it's a deeply humbling experience to read.    The Ideal Sponger Life     The Ideal Sponger Life has the horniest premise for a book that's so deeply immersed in fantasy realpolitik: a man is summoned to another world for the explicit purpose of impregnating a hot queen. Since she wants to retain political power after giving birth, she's hoping the guy will quietly sit around without making a nuisance of himself. It's the ideal male and female fantasy!    Though the book isn't actually all that horny in practice. It goes into exacting detail about all sorts of mundane obscurities, and whenever the subject of sex does come up, it's discussed in a down-to-earth manner. Even if it's not a lurid kind of fantasy, however, the frank and naturalistic way the characters navigate their desires and talk about sex is absolutely appealing in its own way. You can tell that Zenjiro and Aura are an intimate couple without it ever needing to be explicit. Sex is a regular and ever-present aspect of their lives.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex     Arguably the tamest example on this list, My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is nothing like Domestic Girlfriend. The stepsiblings in this novel don't have sex, and there's no hot teacher in the house to complicate the drama either. But my gosh, the sexual tension is palpable. Because of their past history together, Mizuto and Yume have chemistry from the get-go, and some of the “will they or won't they?” moments are genuinely spicy.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is particularly interesting because it switches POV between the two main characters. And between the two, the girl is definitely the hornier one, in spite of her desperate attempts to maintain a preppy image. Reading the ecchi shenanigans partly through Yume's point of view also makes those scenes more titillating because the constant reminder of mutual attraction heightens the tension. And the way complicated feelings can linger even after the sexy situation is over makes the relationship feel all the more real.    No Game, No Life     The emphasis of No Game, No Life is on games and thrills, but it can't be denied that sexual situations make up a big part of the story, with every volume getting at least one colour spread showing the girls buck naked. It's risque enough for some volumes to get banned from Australia, in large part because of how prominent the prepubescent Shiro is in those illustrations.    I have mixed feelings about the lolicon aspect because the nudity is ridiculous fun in its narrative context. In No Game, No Life, high-stakes gambits are juxtaposed with bawdy fanservice, sometimes in the very same scene. An example of this which got adapted in the anime is the shiritori game with Jibril. The nudity is utterly memorable because the entire thing is a mind game; although the two characters are relaxed at this point, every word they utter is only one step removed from a frenetic rush towards death. Bonus points to Sora for having the foresight to censor out the nipples ahead of time.    Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend?     Another light novel with a risque theme, Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend? tackles the taboo of age-gap relationships. In this case, it's about the romance between a 27-year-old office worker lady and a 15-year-old high school boy. Just looking at those ages, you'd immediately assume this romance is cursed, but it helps in this case that it's more com than rom at heart. The main characters get into a relationship early, and the rest of the series is more about navigating the inevitable shenanigans.    Sex comedy is a mainstay in this series, and it works because of how it balances the two characters' perspectives. They're both horny, which is exemplified in how floridly they describe each other's appearances, and the plot consistently puts them in situations that test their restraint. At the same time, they're not emotionally ready to go through with the act, and they're also very conscious about not violating personal boundaries. It's all very sweet and vanilla, perhaps because the premise is so transgressive.    Monogatari     Monogatari is a perennial classic because it's one of the smartest novels to talk so endlessly about sex and libido without ever getting to the point. Some scenes are iconic, like when Araragi spends several pages just describing Hanekawa's panties in Kizumonogatari, an experience that inspires profound thought in him.    I used to find this kind of pseudo-intellectual approach irritating, but nowadays, I can see the fun in winking to the reader like that. If sex is on a lot of people's minds regardless of class or level of education, then it's natural for it to become the subject of “smart person dumb jokes.” Most of the conversations in Monogatari are pure sophistry, but that's kind of the point. Sex is really more of a vehicle of understanding the characters' outlooks.    Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation     If you watched Mushoku Tensei's anime adaptation last year, you've probably made up your own mind about how Rudeus's lolicon interests are portrayed in the early parts of the series. Although I have mixed feelings about the writing in those early days, when I look back on the series as a whole, I think sexuality is an indispensable part of the world. Almost every character, not just Rudeus, has a sexual side that is relevant to their motivations.    There's a lot of talk about whether Mushoku Tensei is only an interesting fantasy series in spite of its focus on sex, but I can't help but disagree—this series would be worse if it didn't have sex as a sub theme. Besides making the individual characters feel like real people with real foibles, it represents a wide spectrum of sexual interests and kinks without overt moralizing, in a way that paints a complicated picture of humanity as a whole. Even if it's not necessarily the approach I would want to see every story take, I appreciate that there is a story like this one out there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

The Best Light Novels With Horny Energy   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 25th 2022          Not long ago, I wrote about light novels with shonen manga energy. Now I'm back with a (mostly new) list of light novel recommendations! The theme this time is “horny.” Many light novels, even of the non-pornographic variety, contain at least some degree of titillating fanservice, so there's no shortage of qualifying titles. But that also means I could be extra discerning with my choices this time.    A quick disclaimer before I get into the list: although none of these titles are porn, I do recommend that you be at least over 18 before you read them. Also, a number of these picks depict sensitive content such as sexual assault, incest, and age gaps. This is not a list specifically focused on healthy or ideal romantic relationships, but rather interesting stories with sexuality as a prominent theme.    Beast † Blood     I really wanted this list to include at least one example of smutty romance for women, but the market for female-oriented light novels in English is still pretty “clean” at the moment… except for Beast † Blood. It starts with an attempted rape scene and doesn't lighten up from there, telling a dark sci-fi thriller story about drugs, crime, and fantasy racism.    In the sex department, it's all about the classic “Beauty and the Beast” romance trope. Much of the focus is on unraveling the mindset of the dark and brooding male protagonist, who struggles with his carnal desires even though the heroine is more than willing to shag him. By the end of the book, you're just begging the guy to admit “I'm horny” instead of torturing himself, but it's what makes the inevitable moment of release that much more cathartic.    High School DxD     Believe it or not, High School DxD is one of the tamer titles on this list. Despite the anime's reputation for raunchiness, the novel counterpart shows significantly less boobs. One of the biggest frustrations around this series over the long term is that, despite the constantly escalating action, the sexual content doesn't scale up proportionally. For all the teases and glimpses of nudity, Issei never gets more intimate with the girls.    However, that's not to say that this series isn't driven by horniness to the core. Issei's sex drive is baked into his motivation, and so, too, is his fear of intimacy after his failed relationship with Yuma. For all the fantasy elements, it's a relatable portrait of teenage male desires and insecurities. It also helps that the girls are both hot and likable as characters. There's a good reason this series is regarded as the cream of the crop among ecchi-focused titles.    Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension     In the real world, mixed bathing onsens have a poor rep among young people and are in steep decline, but in a fantasy world setting, none of that cultural baggage matters. It all comes down to individual consent: Toya wants to get in the bath with girls, but only if they want to do it with him.    Despite its obscurity and stalled publication status, Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension was the first light novel I thought of for this list because the way it deals with sexual situations is genuinely charming. What really stands out about the bath scenes is the curiosity with which boys and girls compare each other's bodies. There's obviously a degree of arousal involved, but there's something to be said for this kind of innocent fascination with other people's bodies. It's an aspect of physical intimacy that feels underrepresented in media.    JK Haru is a Sex Worker in Another World     A bit of context around JK Haru's publication: the popular web novel site Shо̄setsuka ni Narо̄, where many of the so-called “isekai” novels spawned from, has two R-18 offshoot sites: Nocturne, which is for men, and Moonlight, for women. JK Haru was posted on Moonlight, but according to the author's notes, it was written as a commentary on the male sex fantasies posted on Nocturne. The starting point of the novel was “How would a woman feel, being transplanted into a fantasy world that's shallowly structured around male desires?”    The result is a surprisingly varied picture of the life of a sex worker and one of the more fascinating isekai narratives in general. Although there are scenarios that seem directly pulled from a rape fetish manga, JK Haru is also filled with moments of joy and female camaraderie. The characters spend just as much time outside the brothel as in it, living their fullest lives one day at a time. Even if it's not a story about solving the evils of the world, it's a deeply humbling experience to read.    The Ideal Sponger Life     The Ideal Sponger Life has the horniest premise for a book that's so deeply immersed in fantasy realpolitik: a man is summoned to another world for the explicit purpose of impregnating a hot queen. Since she wants to retain political power after giving birth, she's hoping the guy will quietly sit around without making a nuisance of himself. It's the ideal male and female fantasy!    Though the book isn't actually all that horny in practice. It goes into exacting detail about all sorts of mundane obscurities, and whenever the subject of sex does come up, it's discussed in a down-to-earth manner. Even if it's not a lurid kind of fantasy, however, the frank and naturalistic way the characters navigate their desires and talk about sex is absolutely appealing in its own way. You can tell that Zenjiro and Aura are an intimate couple without it ever needing to be explicit. Sex is a regular and ever-present aspect of their lives.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex     Arguably the tamest example on this list, My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is nothing like Domestic Girlfriend. The stepsiblings in this novel don't have sex, and there's no hot teacher in the house to complicate the drama either. But my gosh, the sexual tension is palpable. Because of their past history together, Mizuto and Yume have chemistry from the get-go, and some of the “will they or won't they?” moments are genuinely spicy.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is particularly interesting because it switches POV between the two main characters. And between the two, the girl is definitely the hornier one, in spite of her desperate attempts to maintain a preppy image. Reading the ecchi shenanigans partly through Yume's point of view also makes those scenes more titillating because the constant reminder of mutual attraction heightens the tension. And the way complicated feelings can linger even after the sexy situation is over makes the relationship feel all the more real.    No Game, No Life     The emphasis of No Game, No Life is on games and thrills, but it can't be denied that sexual situations make up a big part of the story, with every volume getting at least one colour spread showing the girls buck naked. It's risque enough for some volumes to get banned from Australia, in large part because of how prominent the prepubescent Shiro is in those illustrations.    I have mixed feelings about the lolicon aspect because the nudity is ridiculous fun in its narrative context. In No Game, No Life, high-stakes gambits are juxtaposed with bawdy fanservice, sometimes in the very same scene. An example of this which got adapted in the anime is the shiritori game with Jibril. The nudity is utterly memorable because the entire thing is a mind game; although the two characters are relaxed at this point, every word they utter is only one step removed from a frenetic rush towards death. Bonus points to Sora for having the foresight to censor out the nipples ahead of time.    Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend?     Another light novel with a risque theme, Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend? tackles the taboo of age-gap relationships. In this case, it's about the romance between a 27-year-old office worker lady and a 15-year-old high school boy. Just looking at those ages, you'd immediately assume this romance is cursed, but it helps in this case that it's more com than rom at heart. The main characters get into a relationship early, and the rest of the series is more about navigating the inevitable shenanigans.    Sex comedy is a mainstay in this series, and it works because of how it balances the two characters' perspectives. They're both horny, which is exemplified in how floridly they describe each other's appearances, and the plot consistently puts them in situations that test their restraint. At the same time, they're not emotionally ready to go through with the act, and they're also very conscious about not violating personal boundaries. It's all very sweet and vanilla, perhaps because the premise is so transgressive.    Monogatari     Monogatari is a perennial classic because it's one of the smartest novels to talk so endlessly about sex and libido without ever getting to the point. Some scenes are iconic, like when Araragi spends several pages just describing Hanekawa's panties in Kizumonogatari, an experience that inspires profound thought in him.    I used to find this kind of pseudo-intellectual approach irritating, but nowadays, I can see the fun in winking to the reader like that. If sex is on a lot of people's minds regardless of class or level of education, then it's natural for it to become the subject of “smart person dumb jokes.” Most of the conversations in Monogatari are pure sophistry, but that's kind of the point. Sex is really more of a vehicle of understanding the characters' outlooks.    Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation     If you watched Mushoku Tensei's anime adaptation last year, you've probably made up your own mind about how Rudeus's lolicon interests are portrayed in the early parts of the series. Although I have mixed feelings about the writing in those early days, when I look back on the series as a whole, I think sexuality is an indispensable part of the world. Almost every character, not just Rudeus, has a sexual side that is relevant to their motivations.    There's a lot of talk about whether Mushoku Tensei is only an interesting fantasy series in spite of its focus on sex, but I can't help but disagree—this series would be worse if it didn't have sex as a sub theme. Besides making the individual characters feel like real people with real foibles, it represents a wide spectrum of sexual interests and kinks without overt moralizing, in a way that paints a complicated picture of humanity as a whole. Even if it's not necessarily the approach I would want to see every story take, I appreciate that there is a story like this one out there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column                The ANN Aftershow - Spy x Family is the Best Anime of the Season?

The Best Light Novels With Horny Energy   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 25th 2022          Not long ago, I wrote about light novels with shonen manga energy.

The Best Light Novels With Horny Energy   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 25th 2022          Not long ago, I wrote about light novels with shonen manga energy. Now I'm back with a (mostly new) list of light novel recommendations! The theme this time is “horny.” Many light novels, even of the non-pornographic variety, contain at least some degree of titillating fanservice, so there's no shortage of qualifying titles. But that also means I could be extra discerning with my choices this time.    A quick disclaimer before I get into the list: although none of these titles are porn, I do recommend that you be at least over 18 before you read them. Also, a number of these picks depict sensitive content such as sexual assault, incest, and age gaps. This is not a list specifically focused on healthy or ideal romantic relationships, but rather interesting stories with sexuality as a prominent theme.    Beast † Blood     I really wanted this list to include at least one example of smutty romance for women, but the market for female-oriented light novels in English is still pretty “clean” at the moment… except for Beast † Blood. It starts with an attempted rape scene and doesn't lighten up from there, telling a dark sci-fi thriller story about drugs, crime, and fantasy racism.    In the sex department, it's all about the classic “Beauty and the Beast” romance trope. Much of the focus is on unraveling the mindset of the dark and brooding male protagonist, who struggles with his carnal desires even though the heroine is more than willing to shag him. By the end of the book, you're just begging the guy to admit “I'm horny” instead of torturing himself, but it's what makes the inevitable moment of release that much more cathartic.    High School DxD     Believe it or not, High School DxD is one of the tamer titles on this list. Despite the anime's reputation for raunchiness, the novel counterpart shows significantly less boobs. One of the biggest frustrations around this series over the long term is that, despite the constantly escalating action, the sexual content doesn't scale up proportionally. For all the teases and glimpses of nudity, Issei never gets more intimate with the girls.    However, that's not to say that this series isn't driven by horniness to the core. Issei's sex drive is baked into his motivation, and so, too, is his fear of intimacy after his failed relationship with Yuma. For all the fantasy elements, it's a relatable portrait of teenage male desires and insecurities. It also helps that the girls are both hot and likable as characters. There's a good reason this series is regarded as the cream of the crop among ecchi-focused titles.    Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension     In the real world, mixed bathing onsens have a poor rep among young people and are in steep decline, but in a fantasy world setting, none of that cultural baggage matters. It all comes down to individual consent: Toya wants to get in the bath with girls, but only if they want to do it with him.    Despite its obscurity and stalled publication status, Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension was the first light novel I thought of for this list because the way it deals with sexual situations is genuinely charming. What really stands out about the bath scenes is the curiosity with which boys and girls compare each other's bodies. There's obviously a degree of arousal involved, but there's something to be said for this kind of innocent fascination with other people's bodies. It's an aspect of physical intimacy that feels underrepresented in media.    JK Haru is a Sex Worker in Another World     A bit of context around JK Haru's publication: the popular web novel site Shо̄setsuka ni Narо̄, where many of the so-called “isekai” novels spawned from, has two R-18 offshoot sites: Nocturne, which is for men, and Moonlight, for women. JK Haru was posted on Moonlight, but according to the author's notes, it was written as a commentary on the male sex fantasies posted on Nocturne. The starting point of the novel was “How would a woman feel, being transplanted into a fantasy world that's shallowly structured around male desires?”    The result is a surprisingly varied picture of the life of a sex worker and one of the more fascinating isekai narratives in general. Although there are scenarios that seem directly pulled from a rape fetish manga, JK Haru is also filled with moments of joy and female camaraderie. The characters spend just as much time outside the brothel as in it, living their fullest lives one day at a time. Even if it's not a story about solving the evils of the world, it's a deeply humbling experience to read.    The Ideal Sponger Life     The Ideal Sponger Life has the horniest premise for a book that's so deeply immersed in fantasy realpolitik: a man is summoned to another world for the explicit purpose of impregnating a hot queen. Since she wants to retain political power after giving birth, she's hoping the guy will quietly sit around without making a nuisance of himself. It's the ideal male and female fantasy!    Though the book isn't actually all that horny in practice. It goes into exacting detail about all sorts of mundane obscurities, and whenever the subject of sex does come up, it's discussed in a down-to-earth manner. Even if it's not a lurid kind of fantasy, however, the frank and naturalistic way the characters navigate their desires and talk about sex is absolutely appealing in its own way. You can tell that Zenjiro and Aura are an intimate couple without it ever needing to be explicit. Sex is a regular and ever-present aspect of their lives.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex     Arguably the tamest example on this list, My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is nothing like Domestic Girlfriend. The stepsiblings in this novel don't have sex, and there's no hot teacher in the house to complicate the drama either. But my gosh, the sexual tension is palpable. Because of their past history together, Mizuto and Yume have chemistry from the get-go, and some of the “will they or won't they?” moments are genuinely spicy.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is particularly interesting because it switches POV between the two main characters. And between the two, the girl is definitely the hornier one, in spite of her desperate attempts to maintain a preppy image. Reading the ecchi shenanigans partly through Yume's point of view also makes those scenes more titillating because the constant reminder of mutual attraction heightens the tension. And the way complicated feelings can linger even after the sexy situation is over makes the relationship feel all the more real.    No Game, No Life     The emphasis of No Game, No Life is on games and thrills, but it can't be denied that sexual situations make up a big part of the story, with every volume getting at least one colour spread showing the girls buck naked. It's risque enough for some volumes to get banned from Australia, in large part because of how prominent the prepubescent Shiro is in those illustrations.    I have mixed feelings about the lolicon aspect because the nudity is ridiculous fun in its narrative context. In No Game, No Life, high-stakes gambits are juxtaposed with bawdy fanservice, sometimes in the very same scene. An example of this which got adapted in the anime is the shiritori game with Jibril. The nudity is utterly memorable because the entire thing is a mind game; although the two characters are relaxed at this point, every word they utter is only one step removed from a frenetic rush towards death. Bonus points to Sora for having the foresight to censor out the nipples ahead of time.    Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend?     Another light novel with a risque theme, Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend? tackles the taboo of age-gap relationships. In this case, it's about the romance between a 27-year-old office worker lady and a 15-year-old high school boy. Just looking at those ages, you'd immediately assume this romance is cursed, but it helps in this case that it's more com than rom at heart. The main characters get into a relationship early, and the rest of the series is more about navigating the inevitable shenanigans.    Sex comedy is a mainstay in this series, and it works because of how it balances the two characters' perspectives. They're both horny, which is exemplified in how floridly they describe each other's appearances, and the plot consistently puts them in situations that test their restraint. At the same time, they're not emotionally ready to go through with the act, and they're also very conscious about not violating personal boundaries. It's all very sweet and vanilla, perhaps because the premise is so transgressive.    Monogatari     Monogatari is a perennial classic because it's one of the smartest novels to talk so endlessly about sex and libido without ever getting to the point. Some scenes are iconic, like when Araragi spends several pages just describing Hanekawa's panties in Kizumonogatari, an experience that inspires profound thought in him.    I used to find this kind of pseudo-intellectual approach irritating, but nowadays, I can see the fun in winking to the reader like that. If sex is on a lot of people's minds regardless of class or level of education, then it's natural for it to become the subject of “smart person dumb jokes.” Most of the conversations in Monogatari are pure sophistry, but that's kind of the point. Sex is really more of a vehicle of understanding the characters' outlooks.    Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation     If you watched Mushoku Tensei's anime adaptation last year, you've probably made up your own mind about how Rudeus's lolicon interests are portrayed in the early parts of the series. Although I have mixed feelings about the writing in those early days, when I look back on the series as a whole, I think sexuality is an indispensable part of the world. Almost every character, not just Rudeus, has a sexual side that is relevant to their motivations.    There's a lot of talk about whether Mushoku Tensei is only an interesting fantasy series in spite of its focus on sex, but I can't help but disagree—this series would be worse if it didn't have sex as a sub theme. Besides making the individual characters feel like real people with real foibles, it represents a wide spectrum of sexual interests and kinks without overt moralizing, in a way that paints a complicated picture of humanity as a whole. Even if it's not necessarily the approach I would want to see every story take, I appreciate that there is a story like this one out there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Issei's sex drive is baked into his motivation, and so, too, is his fear of intimacy after his failed relationship with Yuma. For all the fantasy elements, it's a relatable portrait of teenage male desires and insecurities. It also helps that the girls are both hot and likable as characters. There's a good reason this series is regarded as the cream of the crop among ecchi-focused titles.    Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension     In the real world, mixed bathing onsens have a poor rep among young people and are in steep decline, but in a fantasy world setting, none of that cultural baggage matters. It all comes down to individual consent: Toya wants to get in the bath with girls, but only if they want to do it with him.    Despite its obscurity and stalled publication status, Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension was the first light novel I thought of for this list because the way it deals with sexual situations is genuinely charming. What really stands out about the bath scenes is the curiosity with which boys and girls compare each other's bodies. There's obviously a degree of arousal involved, but there's something to be said for this kind of innocent fascination with other people's bodies. It's an aspect of physical intimacy that feels underrepresented in media.    JK Haru is a Sex Worker in Another World     A bit of context around JK Haru's publication: the popular web novel site Shо̄setsuka ni Narо̄, where many of the so-called “isekai” novels spawned from, has two R-18 offshoot sites: Nocturne, which is for men, and Moonlight, for women. JK Haru was posted on Moonlight, but according to the author's notes, it was written as a commentary on the male sex fantasies posted on Nocturne. The starting point of the novel was “How would a woman feel, being transplanted into a fantasy world that's shallowly structured around male desires?”    The result is a surprisingly varied picture of the life of a sex worker and one of the more fascinating isekai narratives in general. Although there are scenarios that seem directly pulled from a rape fetish manga, JK Haru is also filled with moments of joy and female camaraderie. The characters spend just as much time outside the brothel as in it, living their fullest lives one day at a time. Even if it's not a story about solving the evils of the world, it's a deeply humbling experience to read.    The Ideal Sponger Life     The Ideal Sponger Life has the horniest premise for a book that's so deeply immersed in fantasy realpolitik: a man is summoned to another world for the explicit purpose of impregnating a hot queen. Since she wants to retain political power after giving birth, she's hoping the guy will quietly sit around without making a nuisance of himself. It's the ideal male and female fantasy!    Though the book isn't actually all that horny in practice. It goes into exacting detail about all sorts of mundane obscurities, and whenever the subject of sex does come up, it's discussed in a down-to-earth manner. Even if it's not a lurid kind of fantasy, however, the frank and naturalistic way the characters navigate their desires and talk about sex is absolutely appealing in its own way. You can tell that Zenjiro and Aura are an intimate couple without it ever needing to be explicit. Sex is a regular and ever-present aspect of their lives.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex     Arguably the tamest example on this list, My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is nothing like Domestic Girlfriend. The stepsiblings in this novel don't have sex, and there's no hot teacher in the house to complicate the drama either. But my gosh, the sexual tension is palpable. Because of their past history together, Mizuto and Yume have chemistry from the get-go, and some of the “will they or won't they?” moments are genuinely spicy.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is particularly interesting because it switches POV between the two main characters. And between the two, the girl is definitely the hornier one, in spite of her desperate attempts to maintain a preppy image. Reading the ecchi shenanigans partly through Yume's point of view also makes those scenes more titillating because the constant reminder of mutual attraction heightens the tension. And the way complicated feelings can linger even after the sexy situation is over makes the relationship feel all the more real.    No Game, No Life     The emphasis of No Game, No Life is on games and thrills, but it can't be denied that sexual situations make up a big part of the story, with every volume getting at least one colour spread showing the girls buck naked. It's risque enough for some volumes to get banned from Australia, in large part because of how prominent the prepubescent Shiro is in those illustrations.    I have mixed feelings about the lolicon aspect because the nudity is ridiculous fun in its narrative context. In No Game, No Life, high-stakes gambits are juxtaposed with bawdy fanservice, sometimes in the very same scene. An example of this which got adapted in the anime is the shiritori game with Jibril. The nudity is utterly memorable because the entire thing is a mind game; although the two characters are relaxed at this point, every word they utter is only one step removed from a frenetic rush towards death. Bonus points to Sora for having the foresight to censor out the nipples ahead of time.    Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend?     Another light novel with a risque theme, Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend? tackles the taboo of age-gap relationships. In this case, it's about the romance between a 27-year-old office worker lady and a 15-year-old high school boy. Just looking at those ages, you'd immediately assume this romance is cursed, but it helps in this case that it's more com than rom at heart. The main characters get into a relationship early, and the rest of the series is more about navigating the inevitable shenanigans.    Sex comedy is a mainstay in this series, and it works because of how it balances the two characters' perspectives. They're both horny, which is exemplified in how floridly they describe each other's appearances, and the plot consistently puts them in situations that test their restraint. At the same time, they're not emotionally ready to go through with the act, and they're also very conscious about not violating personal boundaries. It's all very sweet and vanilla, perhaps because the premise is so transgressive.    Monogatari     Monogatari is a perennial classic because it's one of the smartest novels to talk so endlessly about sex and libido without ever getting to the point. Some scenes are iconic, like when Araragi spends several pages just describing Hanekawa's panties in Kizumonogatari, an experience that inspires profound thought in him.    I used to find this kind of pseudo-intellectual approach irritating, but nowadays, I can see the fun in winking to the reader like that. If sex is on a lot of people's minds regardless of class or level of education, then it's natural for it to become the subject of “smart person dumb jokes.” Most of the conversations in Monogatari are pure sophistry, but that's kind of the point. Sex is really more of a vehicle of understanding the characters' outlooks.    Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation     If you watched Mushoku Tensei's anime adaptation last year, you've probably made up your own mind about how Rudeus's lolicon interests are portrayed in the early parts of the series. Although I have mixed feelings about the writing in those early days, when I look back on the series as a whole, I think sexuality is an indispensable part of the world. Almost every character, not just Rudeus, has a sexual side that is relevant to their motivations.    There's a lot of talk about whether Mushoku Tensei is only an interesting fantasy series in spite of its focus on sex, but I can't help but disagree—this series would be worse if it didn't have sex as a sub theme. Besides making the individual characters feel like real people with real foibles, it represents a wide spectrum of sexual interests and kinks without overt moralizing, in a way that paints a complicated picture of humanity as a whole. Even if it's not necessarily the approach I would want to see every story take, I appreciate that there is a story like this one out there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Now I'm back with a (mostly new) list of light novel recommendations! The theme this time is “horny.” Many light novels, even of the non-pornographic variety, contain at least some degree of titillating fanservice, so there's no shortage of qualifying titles. But that also means I could be extra discerning with my choices this time.    A quick disclaimer before I get into the list: although none of these titles are porn, I do recommend that you be at least over 18 before you read them. Also, a number of these picks depict sensitive content such as sexual assault, incest, and age gaps. This is not a list specifically focused on healthy or ideal romantic relationships, but rather interesting stories with sexuality as a prominent theme.    Beast † Blood     I really wanted this list to include at least one example of smutty romance for women, but the market for female-oriented light novels in English is still pretty “clean” at the moment… except for Beast † Blood. It starts with an attempted rape scene and doesn't lighten up from there, telling a dark sci-fi thriller story about drugs, crime, and fantasy racism.    In the sex department, it's all about the classic “Beauty and the Beast” romance trope. Much of the focus is on unraveling the mindset of the dark and brooding male protagonist, who struggles with his carnal desires even though the heroine is more than willing to shag him. By the end of the book, you're just begging the guy to admit “I'm horny” instead of torturing himself, but it's what makes the inevitable moment of release that much more cathartic.    High School DxD     Believe it or not, High School DxD is one of the tamer titles on this list. Despite the anime's reputation for raunchiness, the novel counterpart shows significantly less boobs. One of the biggest frustrations around this series over the long term is that, despite the constantly escalating action, the sexual content doesn't scale up proportionally. For all the teases and glimpses of nudity, Issei never gets more intimate with the girls.    However, that's not to say that this series isn't driven by horniness to the core.

One of the biggest frustrations around this series over the long term is that, despite the constantly escalating action, the sexual content doesn't scale up proportionally. For all the teases and glimpses of nudity, Issei never gets more intimate with the girls.    However, that's not to say that this series isn't driven by horniness to the core. Issei's sex drive is baked into his motivation, and so, too, is his fear of intimacy after his failed relationship with Yuma. For all the fantasy elements, it's a relatable portrait of teenage male desires and insecurities. It also helps that the girls are both hot and likable as characters. There's a good reason this series is regarded as the cream of the crop among ecchi-focused titles.    Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension     In the real world, mixed bathing onsens have a poor rep among young people and are in steep decline, but in a fantasy world setting, none of that cultural baggage matters. It all comes down to individual consent: Toya wants to get in the bath with girls, but only if they want to do it with him.    Despite its obscurity and stalled publication status, Mixed Bathing in Another Dimension was the first light novel I thought of for this list because the way it deals with sexual situations is genuinely charming. What really stands out about the bath scenes is the curiosity with which boys and girls compare each other's bodies. There's obviously a degree of arousal involved, but there's something to be said for this kind of innocent fascination with other people's bodies. It's an aspect of physical intimacy that feels underrepresented in media.    JK Haru is a Sex Worker in Another World     A bit of context around JK Haru's publication: the popular web novel site Shо̄setsuka ni Narо̄, where many of the so-called “isekai” novels spawned from, has two R-18 offshoot sites: Nocturne, which is for men, and Moonlight, for women. JK Haru was posted on Moonlight, but according to the author's notes, it was written as a commentary on the male sex fantasies posted on Nocturne. The starting point of the novel was “How would a woman feel, being transplanted into a fantasy world that's shallowly structured around male desires?”    The result is a surprisingly varied picture of the life of a sex worker and one of the more fascinating isekai narratives in general. Although there are scenarios that seem directly pulled from a rape fetish manga, JK Haru is also filled with moments of joy and female camaraderie. The characters spend just as much time outside the brothel as in it, living their fullest lives one day at a time. Even if it's not a story about solving the evils of the world, it's a deeply humbling experience to read.    The Ideal Sponger Life     The Ideal Sponger Life has the horniest premise for a book that's so deeply immersed in fantasy realpolitik: a man is summoned to another world for the explicit purpose of impregnating a hot queen. Since she wants to retain political power after giving birth, she's hoping the guy will quietly sit around without making a nuisance of himself. It's the ideal male and female fantasy!    Though the book isn't actually all that horny in practice. It goes into exacting detail about all sorts of mundane obscurities, and whenever the subject of sex does come up, it's discussed in a down-to-earth manner. Even if it's not a lurid kind of fantasy, however, the frank and naturalistic way the characters navigate their desires and talk about sex is absolutely appealing in its own way. You can tell that Zenjiro and Aura are an intimate couple without it ever needing to be explicit. Sex is a regular and ever-present aspect of their lives.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex     Arguably the tamest example on this list, My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is nothing like Domestic Girlfriend. The stepsiblings in this novel don't have sex, and there's no hot teacher in the house to complicate the drama either. But my gosh, the sexual tension is palpable. Because of their past history together, Mizuto and Yume have chemistry from the get-go, and some of the “will they or won't they?” moments are genuinely spicy.    My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex is particularly interesting because it switches POV between the two main characters. And between the two, the girl is definitely the hornier one, in spite of her desperate attempts to maintain a preppy image. Reading the ecchi shenanigans partly through Yume's point of view also makes those scenes more titillating because the constant reminder of mutual attraction heightens the tension. And the way complicated feelings can linger even after the sexy situation is over makes the relationship feel all the more real.    No Game, No Life     The emphasis of No Game, No Life is on games and thrills, but it can't be denied that sexual situations make up a big part of the story, with every volume getting at least one colour spread showing the girls buck naked. It's risque enough for some volumes to get banned from Australia, in large part because of how prominent the prepubescent Shiro is in those illustrations.    I have mixed feelings about the lolicon aspect because the nudity is ridiculous fun in its narrative context. In No Game, No Life, high-stakes gambits are juxtaposed with bawdy fanservice, sometimes in the very same scene. An example of this which got adapted in the anime is the shiritori game with Jibril. The nudity is utterly memorable because the entire thing is a mind game; although the two characters are relaxed at this point, every word they utter is only one step removed from a frenetic rush towards death. Bonus points to Sora for having the foresight to censor out the nipples ahead of time.    Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend?     Another light novel with a risque theme, Are You Okay With a Slightly Older Girlfriend? tackles the taboo of age-gap relationships. In this case, it's about the romance between a 27-year-old office worker lady and a 15-year-old high school boy. Just looking at those ages, you'd immediately assume this romance is cursed, but it helps in this case that it's more com than rom at heart. The main characters get into a relationship early, and the rest of the series is more about navigating the inevitable shenanigans.    Sex comedy is a mainstay in this series, and it works because of how it balances the two characters' perspectives. They're both horny, which is exemplified in how floridly they describe each other's appearances, and the plot consistently puts them in situations that test their restraint. At the same time, they're not emotionally ready to go through with the act, and they're also very conscious about not violating personal boundaries. It's all very sweet and vanilla, perhaps because the premise is so transgressive.    Monogatari     Monogatari is a perennial classic because it's one of the smartest novels to talk so endlessly about sex and libido without ever getting to the point. Some scenes are iconic, like when Araragi spends several pages just describing Hanekawa's panties in Kizumonogatari, an experience that inspires profound thought in him.    I used to find this kind of pseudo-intellectual approach irritating, but nowadays, I can see the fun in winking to the reader like that. If sex is on a lot of people's minds regardless of class or level of education, then it's natural for it to become the subject of “smart person dumb jokes.” Most of the conversations in Monogatari are pure sophistry, but that's kind of the point. Sex is really more of a vehicle of understanding the characters' outlooks.    Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation     If you watched Mushoku Tensei's anime adaptation last year, you've probably made up your own mind about how Rudeus's lolicon interests are portrayed in the early parts of the series. Although I have mixed feelings about the writing in those early days, when I look back on the series as a whole, I think sexuality is an indispensable part of the world. Almost every character, not just Rudeus, has a sexual side that is relevant to their motivations.    There's a lot of talk about whether Mushoku Tensei is only an interesting fantasy series in spite of its focus on sex, but I can't help but disagree—this series would be worse if it didn't have sex as a sub theme. Besides making the individual characters feel like real people with real foibles, it represents a wide spectrum of sexual interests and kinks without overt moralizing, in a way that paints a complicated picture of humanity as a whole. Even if it's not necessarily the approach I would want to see every story take, I appreciate that there is a story like this one out there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Now I'm back with a (mostly new) list of light novel recommendations! The theme this time is “horny.” Many light novels, even of the non-pornographic variety, contain at least some degree of titillating fanservice, so there's no shortage of qualifying titles. But that also means I could be extra discerning with my choices this time.    A quick disclaimer before I get into the list: although none of these titles are porn, I do recommend that you be at least over 18 before you read them. Also, a number of these picks depict sensitive content such as sexual assault, incest, and age gaps. This is not a list specifically focused on healthy or ideal romantic relationships, but rather interesting stories with sexuality as a prominent theme.    Beast † Blood     I really wanted this list to include at least one example of smutty romance for women, but the market for female-oriented light novels in English is still pretty “clean” at the moment… except for Beast † Blood. It starts with an attempted rape scene and doesn't lighten up from there, telling a dark sci-fi thriller story about drugs, crime, and fantasy racism.    In the sex department, it's all about the classic “Beauty and the Beast” romance trope. Much of the focus is on unraveling the mindset of the dark and brooding male protagonist, who struggles with his carnal desires even though the heroine is more than willing to shag him. By the end of the book, you're just begging the guy to admit “I'm horny” instead of torturing himself, but it's what makes the inevitable moment of release that much more cathartic.    High School DxD     Believe it or not, High School DxD is one of the tamer titles on this list. Despite the anime's reputation for raunchiness, the novel counterpart shows significantly less boobs.

As someone who hasn't really played the game I'm curious to see how it goes. Also the OP might be the best in the love live franchise animation and execution wise      Back to top                  JustMonika    Joined: 17 Jan 2022 		    Posts: 112       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:18 pm            So far this is actually my favorite Love Live series. Definitely buying Season 1 when it releases in July.      Back to top                  Rouward    Joined: 11 Jan 2016 		    Posts: 12 		    Location: PH 		        Posted: Sat Apr 23, 2022 7:07 pm            I've been thinking about this as a long time LLer since 2015. Nijigasaki is the exact Love Live I've been looking for a long time with a modern take on pop cultures without following the same old formula that original series established.   That Episode 2 gave me the biggest acid trip in my whole life because I was so attatched to Emma and Kasumi and I didn't expected them to have a closer relationships here. Not to mention the direction in this one especially from the playground scene to their vocal practice stunned me and hits right in my feelings.      Back to top                   TaperW    Joined: 14 Nov 2020 		    Posts: 7       Posted: Sun Apr 24, 2022 10:41 pm            It's tricky for me to say much in detail about the episodes we've had so far. I picked up the SIFAS game on a whim shortly after its release in non-Japanese regions, and have gotten hooked hard by the franchise in the couple of years since. The first season of the Nijigasaki anime was  not just the first series of Love Live I'd watched in full, but the first anime series I'd watched as it came out in years. So I've got a huge attachment to the series and rather too much knowledge of how the game's version of events went.   That said, one of the things that the Nijigasaki anime does right is its attitude towards adaptation.

Anyway. Two things more. First, from episode one, it was great to see the (brief) triumphant return of the Nagashi Soumen Club, with their multi-story bamboo structure seen behind Mia and Hanpen. And second, in episode four, I actually think it was important that when Ai was fretting in the dressing room before the concert, concerned about getting her feelings across to Misato — it's Rina that hugs her. Rina, who is all about overcoming barriers to communication, and to whom Ai has given the sort of fun that she wants to show Misato.   (Okay, maybe I'm just endlessly soppy about Rina.)

Nijigasaki is the exact Love Live I've been looking for a long time with a modern take on pop cultures without following the same old formula that original series established.   That Episode 2 gave me the biggest acid trip in my whole life because I was so attatched to Emma and Kasumi and I didn't expected them to have a closer relationships here. Not to mention the direction in this one especially from the playground scene to their vocal practice stunned me and hits right in my feelings.      Back to top                   TaperW    Joined: 14 Nov 2020 		    Posts: 7       Posted: Sun Apr 24, 2022 10:41 pm            It's tricky for me to say much in detail about the episodes we've had so far. I picked up the SIFAS game on a whim shortly after its release in non-Japanese regions, and have gotten hooked hard by the franchise in the couple of years since. The first season of the Nijigasaki anime was  not just the first series of Love Live I'd watched in full, but the first anime series I'd watched as it came out in years. So I've got a huge attachment to the series and rather too much knowledge of how the game's version of events went.   That said, one of the things that the Nijigasaki anime does right is its attitude towards adaptation. It's not giving you the events of the game, except in the broadest possible terms, but it is giving you the emotional resonances the characters went through.    The other thing it does right is fanservice, though the way I'm using that term might be a bit out of fashion in the wake of the My Dress-Up Darling discourse. But the rapid pace and low weight of references and easter eggs the show throws out is — to my tastes, at least — the best way to do it for a franchise with as much lore from as many sources as Love live does. You don't need to know which SIFAS cards the costume cameos in the MVs are from, or that several shots from the ""School Idol Festival 2"" promo video are replicating scenes from the comic strips from prior to the game's release; just drop them in as interesting on their own and move on.  Anyway. Two things more. First, from episode one, it was great to see the (brief) triumphant return of the Nagashi Soumen Club, with their multi-story bamboo structure seen behind Mia and Hanpen. And second, in episode four, I actually think it was important that when Ai was fretting in the dressing room before the concert, concerned about getting her feelings across to Misato — it's Rina that hugs her. Rina, who is all about overcoming barriers to communication, and to whom Ai has given the sort of fun that she wants to show Misato.   (Okay, maybe I'm just endlessly soppy about Rina.)

Nijigasaki is the exact Love Live I've been looking for a long time with a modern take on pop cultures without following the same old formula that original series established.   That Episode 2 gave me the biggest acid trip in my whole life because I was so attatched to Emma and Kasumi and I didn't expected them to have a closer relationships here. Not to mention the direction in this one especially from the playground scene to their vocal practice stunned me and hits right in my feelings.      Back to top                   TaperW    Joined: 14 Nov 2020 		    Posts: 7       Posted: Sun Apr 24, 2022 10:41 pm            It's tricky for me to say much in detail about the episodes we've had so far. I picked up the SIFAS game on a whim shortly after its release in non-Japanese regions, and have gotten hooked hard by the franchise in the couple of years since. The first season of the Nijigasaki anime was  not just the first series of Love Live I'd watched in full, but the first anime series I'd watched as it came out in years. So I've got a huge attachment to the series and rather too much knowledge of how the game's version of events went.   That said, one of the things that the Nijigasaki anime does right is its attitude towards adaptation. It's not giving you the events of the game, except in the broadest possible terms, but it is giving you the emotional resonances the characters went through.    The other thing it does right is fanservice, though the way I'm using that term might be a bit out of fashion in the wake of the My Dress-Up Darling discourse. But the rapid pace and low weight of references and easter eggs the show throws out is — to my tastes, at least — the best way to do it for a franchise with as much lore from as many sources as Love live does. You don't need to know which SIFAS cards the costume cameos in the MVs are from, or that several shots from the ""School Idol Festival 2"" promo video are replicating scenes from the comic strips from prior to the game's release; just drop them in as interesting on their own and move on.  Anyway. Two things more. First, from episode one, it was great to see the (brief) triumphant return of the Nagashi Soumen Club, with their multi-story bamboo structure seen behind Mia and Hanpen. And second, in episode four, I actually think it was important that when Ai was fretting in the dressing room before the concert, concerned about getting her feelings across to Misato — it's Rina that hugs her. Rina, who is all about overcoming barriers to communication, and to whom Ai has given the sort of fun that she wants to show Misato.   (Okay, maybe I'm just endlessly soppy about Rina.)

Nijigasaki is the exact Love Live I've been looking for a long time with a modern take on pop cultures without following the same old formula that original series established.   That Episode 2 gave me the biggest acid trip in my whole life because I was so attatched to Emma and Kasumi and I didn't expected them to have a closer relationships here. Not to mention the direction in this one especially from the playground scene to their vocal practice stunned me and hits right in my feelings.

I picked up the SIFAS game on a whim shortly after its release in non-Japanese regions, and have gotten hooked hard by the franchise in the couple of years since. The first season of the Nijigasaki anime was  not just the first series of Love Live I'd watched in full, but the first anime series I'd watched as it came out in years. So I've got a huge attachment to the series and rather too much knowledge of how the game's version of events went.   That said, one of the things that the Nijigasaki anime does right is its attitude towards adaptation. It's not giving you the events of the game, except in the broadest possible terms, but it is giving you the emotional resonances the characters went through.    The other thing it does right is fanservice, though the way I'm using that term might be a bit out of fashion in the wake of the My Dress-Up Darling discourse. But the rapid pace and low weight of references and easter eggs the show throws out is — to my tastes, at least — the best way to do it for a franchise with as much lore from as many sources as Love live does. You don't need to know which SIFAS cards the costume cameos in the MVs are from, or that several shots from the ""School Idol Festival 2"" promo video are replicating scenes from the comic strips from prior to the game's release; just drop them in as interesting on their own and move on.  Anyway. Two things more. First, from episode one, it was great to see the (brief) triumphant return of the Nagashi Soumen Club, with their multi-story bamboo structure seen behind Mia and Hanpen. And second, in episode four, I actually think it was important that when Ai was fretting in the dressing room before the concert, concerned about getting her feelings across to Misato — it's Rina that hugs her. Rina, who is all about overcoming barriers to communication, and to whom Ai has given the sort of fun that she wants to show Misato.   (Okay, maybe I'm just endlessly soppy about Rina.)

Nijigasaki is the exact Love Live I've been looking for a long time with a modern take on pop cultures without following the same old formula that original series established.   That Episode 2 gave me the biggest acid trip in my whole life because I was so attatched to Emma and Kasumi and I didn't expected them to have a closer relationships here. Not to mention the direction in this one especially from the playground scene to their vocal practice stunned me and hits right in my feelings.

I picked up the SIFAS game on a whim shortly after its release in non-Japanese regions, and have gotten hooked hard by the franchise in the couple of years since. The first season of the Nijigasaki anime was  not just the first series of Love Live I'd watched in full, but the first anime series I'd watched as it came out in years. So I've got a huge attachment to the series and rather too much knowledge of how the game's version of events went.   That said, one of the things that the Nijigasaki anime does right is its attitude towards adaptation. It's not giving you the events of the game, except in the broadest possible terms, but it is giving you the emotional resonances the characters went through.    The other thing it does right is fanservice, though the way I'm using that term might be a bit out of fashion in the wake of the My Dress-Up Darling discourse. But the rapid pace and low weight of references and easter eggs the show throws out is — to my tastes, at least — the best way to do it for a franchise with as much lore from as many sources as Love live does. You don't need to know which SIFAS cards the costume cameos in the MVs are from, or that several shots from the ""School Idol Festival 2"" promo video are replicating scenes from the comic strips from prior to the game's release; just drop them in as interesting on their own and move on.  Anyway. Two things more. First, from episode one, it was great to see the (brief) triumphant return of the Nagashi Soumen Club, with their multi-story bamboo structure seen behind Mia and Hanpen. And second, in episode four, I actually think it was important that when Ai was fretting in the dressing room before the concert, concerned about getting her feelings across to Misato — it's Rina that hugs her. Rina, who is all about overcoming barriers to communication, and to whom Ai has given the sort of fun that she wants to show Misato.   (Okay, maybe I'm just endlessly soppy about Rina.)

Review:         Synopsis:        The city of Neo-San Francisco is being threatened! The evil corporation OctInq, led by the CEO Seo, has been luring consumers into buying its luxury products with slick marketing, transforming them into goo. Luckily, Muteki has just moved to the city. When he hears his friend DJ's sick beats, he transforms into Muteking, the Dancing Hero, to defeat the evil and return the goo back to their human forms.     Review:            If you haven't seen a single episode of Muteking the Dancing Hero, you may think I'm making it up, or that I'm imposing Western values onto the show when I say that it's about how technocrats have gentrified San Francisco. You may think there's no way a remake of a cheesy 1980s tokusatsu anime is specifically about an issue occurring in a specific American city, or that there's some kind of allegory I'm missing, or that they're just telling a story they think is fun with no message. However, watch an episode or two and it becomes abundantly transparent that there is no subtlety to the clear and direct parallels between the show's story and what is happening in real life.    It's not unprecedented either; Muteking is one of a long line of Tatsunoko reimaginings that tackles matters of social injustice, the most famous example being Gatchaman Crowds and its sequel Insight. It telegraphs its intent clearly from the very start, when Muteki arrives in Neo San Francisco. He tries to stop for food at a fast food joint painted and decorated all in black, a sharp contrast to the colorful cityscape around him. On his way to his grandmother's, he catches a public broadcast by Seo, the Steve Jobs-esque CEO of the tech company OctInq – an obvious analog to Apple – announcing their new portable music device and encouraging everyone to throw away their Walkmans and boomboxes. Throughout the show, Seo introduces a number of tech-driven schemes spoofing on trends like wellness retreats and gimmicky restaurants, all designed to melt the people of Neo-San Francisco into a literal blob of complacency, furthering OctInq's nefarious ends. Muteki transforms into Muteking via his boombox-wielding friend DJ's DJing, roller skates around while singing, and in the end defeats the blob and returns the people back to normal.    The first four episodes follow a fairly simple structure, with Muteki transforming toward the end of the last half of each episode, doing his song and dance as Muteking, and defeating the villain without much effort. This adherence to formula in the latter half of the episodes – and the ease with which Muteking wins – leave Muteki free to explore the vibrancy of Neo San Francisco, meet new people, and grow as a person. He develops a crush on Aida, the waitress at a local diner, and befriends a group of siblings who hang out at a run-down arcade, and its proprietress Vivi.    The setting seems to have been designed by someone with a great love of and nostalgia for San Francisco before the tech companies moved in. The areas where OctInq have yet to take hold are awash in bright colors, populated by artists and folks in alternative dress, many of whom are visibly and unabashedly queer and gender non-conforming. The dismal black-and-gray color scheme of OctInq is a direct criticism of the “sleek minimalism” aesthetic pushed by tech companies, and may even be inspired by “gentrifier gray,” a cool gray tone popular with property owners in San Francisco for painting over units in once-colorful neighborhoods. Much like in reality, once-thriving neighborhoods like the one where Vivi's arcade resides have become empty and depressing. It is, perhaps, an over-romanticization of San Francisco's past, when the city has always been rife with issues, but it is earnest and endearing to see nonetheless.    As one would expect from a series with the word “dancing” in the title, music plays a huge role in the series. The opening and ending are both certifiable bops with great visuals to go along with them; the former in particular tends to get stuck in my head for days, but to be honest I rarely ever mind; it's just that good. The diegetic music is strong as well, with a variety of genres ranging from the old-school tokusatsu charm of Muteking's theme song to the electronica of the EDM singer Aurora. At least I think it's EDM; I know nothing about electronic music outside of synthpop and keytars… It does sometimes feel judgmental about what the story considers good, creative music versus engineered, corporate music, but that's a relatively minor quibble.    By now, you may be wondering if there's anything to be gotten out of the show if you don't care about gentrification, the looming technocracy, or San Francisco. My answer is, of course, “Yes, but also you should care.” The storytelling and character development are snappy and fast-paced, always ready to surprise you the moment you suspect it's falling into formula. Transforming into Muteking is a, well, transformative experience for Muteki as he comes to embrace his role as the dancing hero, and watching his relationships with the people around him is always fun. His romance subplot with Aida is less compelling and, to be honest, comes across as half-hearted compared to his bonds with DJ, Vivi, and the four siblings.    The story divides up neatly into three acts, and the final act is where it gets into trouble. The problem with telling a story that's an allegory for an ongoing social problem is eventually you have to resolve the conflict and create a satisfying conclusion. Gentrification by the technocracy and the homogenization of culture do not have tidy answers, or at least not ones that are fun to depict onscreen. Instead, the story descends into pure spectacle, embracing tokusatsu tropes left and right without regard for coherence or thematic consistency. This wouldn't be so bad, but a lot of the twists at that point feel random, contrived, or cliché as the story builds to its climax. By the end, the threat may be eliminated, but a lot of emotional loose ends never get fully tied up.    In light of that mess of an ending, it's hard to say whether or not I'd fully recommend Muteking the Dancing Hero. It's certainly a fun show, but what's more, its themes may hit hard depending on your life experiences. While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade. I've watched the gay clubs and watering holes in the historic LGBT neighborhood be replaced with wine bars and upscale apartment buildings as the area becomes less safe for people to be who they are. Almost every house on my block is being knocked down and replaced with identical glossy, expensive townhouses. Muteking recognizes the damage that does to a city, but just doesn't know what to do with it.

Review:         Synopsis:        The city of Neo-San Francisco is being threatened! The evil corporation OctInq, led by the CEO Seo, has been luring consumers into buying its luxury products with slick marketing, transforming them into goo. Luckily, Muteki has just moved to the city. When he hears his friend DJ's sick beats, he transforms into Muteking, the Dancing Hero, to defeat the evil and return the goo back to their human forms.     Review:            If you haven't seen a single episode of Muteking the Dancing Hero, you may think I'm making it up, or that I'm imposing Western values onto the show when I say that it's about how technocrats have gentrified San Francisco. You may think there's no way a remake of a cheesy 1980s tokusatsu anime is specifically about an issue occurring in a specific American city, or that there's some kind of allegory I'm missing, or that they're just telling a story they think is fun with no message. However, watch an episode or two and it becomes abundantly transparent that there is no subtlety to the clear and direct parallels between the show's story and what is happening in real life.    It's not unprecedented either; Muteking is one of a long line of Tatsunoko reimaginings that tackles matters of social injustice, the most famous example being Gatchaman Crowds and its sequel Insight. It telegraphs its intent clearly from the very start, when Muteki arrives in Neo San Francisco. He tries to stop for food at a fast food joint painted and decorated all in black, a sharp contrast to the colorful cityscape around him. On his way to his grandmother's, he catches a public broadcast by Seo, the Steve Jobs-esque CEO of the tech company OctInq – an obvious analog to Apple – announcing their new portable music device and encouraging everyone to throw away their Walkmans and boomboxes. Throughout the show, Seo introduces a number of tech-driven schemes spoofing on trends like wellness retreats and gimmicky restaurants, all designed to melt the people of Neo-San Francisco into a literal blob of complacency, furthering OctInq's nefarious ends. Muteki transforms into Muteking via his boombox-wielding friend DJ's DJing, roller skates around while singing, and in the end defeats the blob and returns the people back to normal.    The first four episodes follow a fairly simple structure, with Muteki transforming toward the end of the last half of each episode, doing his song and dance as Muteking, and defeating the villain without much effort. This adherence to formula in the latter half of the episodes – and the ease with which Muteking wins – leave Muteki free to explore the vibrancy of Neo San Francisco, meet new people, and grow as a person. He develops a crush on Aida, the waitress at a local diner, and befriends a group of siblings who hang out at a run-down arcade, and its proprietress Vivi.    The setting seems to have been designed by someone with a great love of and nostalgia for San Francisco before the tech companies moved in. The areas where OctInq have yet to take hold are awash in bright colors, populated by artists and folks in alternative dress, many of whom are visibly and unabashedly queer and gender non-conforming. The dismal black-and-gray color scheme of OctInq is a direct criticism of the “sleek minimalism” aesthetic pushed by tech companies, and may even be inspired by “gentrifier gray,” a cool gray tone popular with property owners in San Francisco for painting over units in once-colorful neighborhoods. Much like in reality, once-thriving neighborhoods like the one where Vivi's arcade resides have become empty and depressing. It is, perhaps, an over-romanticization of San Francisco's past, when the city has always been rife with issues, but it is earnest and endearing to see nonetheless.    As one would expect from a series with the word “dancing” in the title, music plays a huge role in the series. The opening and ending are both certifiable bops with great visuals to go along with them; the former in particular tends to get stuck in my head for days, but to be honest I rarely ever mind; it's just that good. The diegetic music is strong as well, with a variety of genres ranging from the old-school tokusatsu charm of Muteking's theme song to the electronica of the EDM singer Aurora. At least I think it's EDM; I know nothing about electronic music outside of synthpop and keytars… It does sometimes feel judgmental about what the story considers good, creative music versus engineered, corporate music, but that's a relatively minor quibble.    By now, you may be wondering if there's anything to be gotten out of the show if you don't care about gentrification, the looming technocracy, or San Francisco. My answer is, of course, “Yes, but also you should care.” The storytelling and character development are snappy and fast-paced, always ready to surprise you the moment you suspect it's falling into formula. Transforming into Muteking is a, well, transformative experience for Muteki as he comes to embrace his role as the dancing hero, and watching his relationships with the people around him is always fun. His romance subplot with Aida is less compelling and, to be honest, comes across as half-hearted compared to his bonds with DJ, Vivi, and the four siblings.    The story divides up neatly into three acts, and the final act is where it gets into trouble. The problem with telling a story that's an allegory for an ongoing social problem is eventually you have to resolve the conflict and create a satisfying conclusion. Gentrification by the technocracy and the homogenization of culture do not have tidy answers, or at least not ones that are fun to depict onscreen. Instead, the story descends into pure spectacle, embracing tokusatsu tropes left and right without regard for coherence or thematic consistency. This wouldn't be so bad, but a lot of the twists at that point feel random, contrived, or cliché as the story builds to its climax. By the end, the threat may be eliminated, but a lot of emotional loose ends never get fully tied up.    In light of that mess of an ending, it's hard to say whether or not I'd fully recommend Muteking the Dancing Hero. It's certainly a fun show, but what's more, its themes may hit hard depending on your life experiences. While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade. I've watched the gay clubs and watering holes in the historic LGBT neighborhood be replaced with wine bars and upscale apartment buildings as the area becomes less safe for people to be who they are. Almost every house on my block is being knocked down and replaced with identical glossy, expensive townhouses. Muteking recognizes the damage that does to a city, but just doesn't know what to do with it.

Review   by Caitlin Moore, Apr 24th 2022       Muteking: The Dancing Hero 1-12 Streaming                     Synopsis:             The city of Neo-San Francisco is being threatened! The evil corporation OctInq, led by the CEO Seo, has been luring consumers into buying its luxury products with slick marketing, transforming them into goo.

When he hears his friend DJ's sick beats, he transforms into Muteking, the Dancing Hero, to defeat the evil and return the goo back to their human forms.      Review:         Synopsis:        The city of Neo-San Francisco is being threatened! The evil corporation OctInq, led by the CEO Seo, has been luring consumers into buying its luxury products with slick marketing, transforming them into goo. Luckily, Muteki has just moved to the city. When he hears his friend DJ's sick beats, he transforms into Muteking, the Dancing Hero, to defeat the evil and return the goo back to their human forms.     Review:            If you haven't seen a single episode of Muteking the Dancing Hero, you may think I'm making it up, or that I'm imposing Western values onto the show when I say that it's about how technocrats have gentrified San Francisco. You may think there's no way a remake of a cheesy 1980s tokusatsu anime is specifically about an issue occurring in a specific American city, or that there's some kind of allegory I'm missing, or that they're just telling a story they think is fun with no message. However, watch an episode or two and it becomes abundantly transparent that there is no subtlety to the clear and direct parallels between the show's story and what is happening in real life.    It's not unprecedented either; Muteking is one of a long line of Tatsunoko reimaginings that tackles matters of social injustice, the most famous example being Gatchaman Crowds and its sequel Insight. It telegraphs its intent clearly from the very start, when Muteki arrives in Neo San Francisco. He tries to stop for food at a fast food joint painted and decorated all in black, a sharp contrast to the colorful cityscape around him. On his way to his grandmother's, he catches a public broadcast by Seo, the Steve Jobs-esque CEO of the tech company OctInq – an obvious analog to Apple – announcing their new portable music device and encouraging everyone to throw away their Walkmans and boomboxes. Throughout the show, Seo introduces a number of tech-driven schemes spoofing on trends like wellness retreats and gimmicky restaurants, all designed to melt the people of Neo-San Francisco into a literal blob of complacency, furthering OctInq's nefarious ends. Muteki transforms into Muteking via his boombox-wielding friend DJ's DJing, roller skates around while singing, and in the end defeats the blob and returns the people back to normal.    The first four episodes follow a fairly simple structure, with Muteki transforming toward the end of the last half of each episode, doing his song and dance as Muteking, and defeating the villain without much effort. This adherence to formula in the latter half of the episodes – and the ease with which Muteking wins – leave Muteki free to explore the vibrancy of Neo San Francisco, meet new people, and grow as a person. He develops a crush on Aida, the waitress at a local diner, and befriends a group of siblings who hang out at a run-down arcade, and its proprietress Vivi.    The setting seems to have been designed by someone with a great love of and nostalgia for San Francisco before the tech companies moved in. The areas where OctInq have yet to take hold are awash in bright colors, populated by artists and folks in alternative dress, many of whom are visibly and unabashedly queer and gender non-conforming. The dismal black-and-gray color scheme of OctInq is a direct criticism of the “sleek minimalism” aesthetic pushed by tech companies, and may even be inspired by “gentrifier gray,” a cool gray tone popular with property owners in San Francisco for painting over units in once-colorful neighborhoods. Much like in reality, once-thriving neighborhoods like the one where Vivi's arcade resides have become empty and depressing. It is, perhaps, an over-romanticization of San Francisco's past, when the city has always been rife with issues, but it is earnest and endearing to see nonetheless.    As one would expect from a series with the word “dancing” in the title, music plays a huge role in the series. The opening and ending are both certifiable bops with great visuals to go along with them; the former in particular tends to get stuck in my head for days, but to be honest I rarely ever mind; it's just that good. The diegetic music is strong as well, with a variety of genres ranging from the old-school tokusatsu charm of Muteking's theme song to the electronica of the EDM singer Aurora. At least I think it's EDM; I know nothing about electronic music outside of synthpop and keytars… It does sometimes feel judgmental about what the story considers good, creative music versus engineered, corporate music, but that's a relatively minor quibble.    By now, you may be wondering if there's anything to be gotten out of the show if you don't care about gentrification, the looming technocracy, or San Francisco. My answer is, of course, “Yes, but also you should care.” The storytelling and character development are snappy and fast-paced, always ready to surprise you the moment you suspect it's falling into formula. Transforming into Muteking is a, well, transformative experience for Muteki as he comes to embrace his role as the dancing hero, and watching his relationships with the people around him is always fun. His romance subplot with Aida is less compelling and, to be honest, comes across as half-hearted compared to his bonds with DJ, Vivi, and the four siblings.    The story divides up neatly into three acts, and the final act is where it gets into trouble. The problem with telling a story that's an allegory for an ongoing social problem is eventually you have to resolve the conflict and create a satisfying conclusion. Gentrification by the technocracy and the homogenization of culture do not have tidy answers, or at least not ones that are fun to depict onscreen. Instead, the story descends into pure spectacle, embracing tokusatsu tropes left and right without regard for coherence or thematic consistency. This wouldn't be so bad, but a lot of the twists at that point feel random, contrived, or cliché as the story builds to its climax. By the end, the threat may be eliminated, but a lot of emotional loose ends never get fully tied up.    In light of that mess of an ending, it's hard to say whether or not I'd fully recommend Muteking the Dancing Hero. It's certainly a fun show, but what's more, its themes may hit hard depending on your life experiences. While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade. I've watched the gay clubs and watering holes in the historic LGBT neighborhood be replaced with wine bars and upscale apartment buildings as the area becomes less safe for people to be who they are. Almost every house on my block is being knocked down and replaced with identical glossy, expensive townhouses. Muteking recognizes the damage that does to a city, but just doesn't know what to do with it.

Review:         Synopsis:        The city of Neo-San Francisco is being threatened! The evil corporation OctInq, led by the CEO Seo, has been luring consumers into buying its luxury products with slick marketing, transforming them into goo. Luckily, Muteki has just moved to the city. When he hears his friend DJ's sick beats, he transforms into Muteking, the Dancing Hero, to defeat the evil and return the goo back to their human forms.     Review:            If you haven't seen a single episode of Muteking the Dancing Hero, you may think I'm making it up, or that I'm imposing Western values onto the show when I say that it's about how technocrats have gentrified San Francisco. You may think there's no way a remake of a cheesy 1980s tokusatsu anime is specifically about an issue occurring in a specific American city, or that there's some kind of allegory I'm missing, or that they're just telling a story they think is fun with no message. However, watch an episode or two and it becomes abundantly transparent that there is no subtlety to the clear and direct parallels between the show's story and what is happening in real life.    It's not unprecedented either; Muteking is one of a long line of Tatsunoko reimaginings that tackles matters of social injustice, the most famous example being Gatchaman Crowds and its sequel Insight. It telegraphs its intent clearly from the very start, when Muteki arrives in Neo San Francisco. He tries to stop for food at a fast food joint painted and decorated all in black, a sharp contrast to the colorful cityscape around him. On his way to his grandmother's, he catches a public broadcast by Seo, the Steve Jobs-esque CEO of the tech company OctInq – an obvious analog to Apple – announcing their new portable music device and encouraging everyone to throw away their Walkmans and boomboxes. Throughout the show, Seo introduces a number of tech-driven schemes spoofing on trends like wellness retreats and gimmicky restaurants, all designed to melt the people of Neo-San Francisco into a literal blob of complacency, furthering OctInq's nefarious ends. Muteki transforms into Muteking via his boombox-wielding friend DJ's DJing, roller skates around while singing, and in the end defeats the blob and returns the people back to normal.    The first four episodes follow a fairly simple structure, with Muteki transforming toward the end of the last half of each episode, doing his song and dance as Muteking, and defeating the villain without much effort. This adherence to formula in the latter half of the episodes – and the ease with which Muteking wins – leave Muteki free to explore the vibrancy of Neo San Francisco, meet new people, and grow as a person. He develops a crush on Aida, the waitress at a local diner, and befriends a group of siblings who hang out at a run-down arcade, and its proprietress Vivi.    The setting seems to have been designed by someone with a great love of and nostalgia for San Francisco before the tech companies moved in. The areas where OctInq have yet to take hold are awash in bright colors, populated by artists and folks in alternative dress, many of whom are visibly and unabashedly queer and gender non-conforming. The dismal black-and-gray color scheme of OctInq is a direct criticism of the “sleek minimalism” aesthetic pushed by tech companies, and may even be inspired by “gentrifier gray,” a cool gray tone popular with property owners in San Francisco for painting over units in once-colorful neighborhoods. Much like in reality, once-thriving neighborhoods like the one where Vivi's arcade resides have become empty and depressing. It is, perhaps, an over-romanticization of San Francisco's past, when the city has always been rife with issues, but it is earnest and endearing to see nonetheless.    As one would expect from a series with the word “dancing” in the title, music plays a huge role in the series. The opening and ending are both certifiable bops with great visuals to go along with them; the former in particular tends to get stuck in my head for days, but to be honest I rarely ever mind; it's just that good. The diegetic music is strong as well, with a variety of genres ranging from the old-school tokusatsu charm of Muteking's theme song to the electronica of the EDM singer Aurora. At least I think it's EDM; I know nothing about electronic music outside of synthpop and keytars… It does sometimes feel judgmental about what the story considers good, creative music versus engineered, corporate music, but that's a relatively minor quibble.    By now, you may be wondering if there's anything to be gotten out of the show if you don't care about gentrification, the looming technocracy, or San Francisco. My answer is, of course, “Yes, but also you should care.” The storytelling and character development are snappy and fast-paced, always ready to surprise you the moment you suspect it's falling into formula. Transforming into Muteking is a, well, transformative experience for Muteki as he comes to embrace his role as the dancing hero, and watching his relationships with the people around him is always fun. His romance subplot with Aida is less compelling and, to be honest, comes across as half-hearted compared to his bonds with DJ, Vivi, and the four siblings.    The story divides up neatly into three acts, and the final act is where it gets into trouble. The problem with telling a story that's an allegory for an ongoing social problem is eventually you have to resolve the conflict and create a satisfying conclusion. Gentrification by the technocracy and the homogenization of culture do not have tidy answers, or at least not ones that are fun to depict onscreen. Instead, the story descends into pure spectacle, embracing tokusatsu tropes left and right without regard for coherence or thematic consistency. This wouldn't be so bad, but a lot of the twists at that point feel random, contrived, or cliché as the story builds to its climax. By the end, the threat may be eliminated, but a lot of emotional loose ends never get fully tied up.    In light of that mess of an ending, it's hard to say whether or not I'd fully recommend Muteking the Dancing Hero. It's certainly a fun show, but what's more, its themes may hit hard depending on your life experiences. While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade. I've watched the gay clubs and watering holes in the historic LGBT neighborhood be replaced with wine bars and upscale apartment buildings as the area becomes less safe for people to be who they are. Almost every house on my block is being knocked down and replaced with identical glossy, expensive townhouses. Muteking recognizes the damage that does to a city, but just doesn't know what to do with it.

As one would expect from a series with the word “dancing” in the title, music plays a huge role in the series. The opening and ending are both certifiable bops with great visuals to go along with them; the former in particular tends to get stuck in my head for days, but to be honest I rarely ever mind; it's just that good. The diegetic music is strong as well, with a variety of genres ranging from the old-school tokusatsu charm of Muteking's theme song to the electronica of the EDM singer Aurora. At least I think it's EDM; I know nothing about electronic music outside of synthpop and keytars… It does sometimes feel judgmental about what the story considers good, creative music versus engineered, corporate music, but that's a relatively minor quibble.    By now, you may be wondering if there's anything to be gotten out of the show if you don't care about gentrification, the looming technocracy, or San Francisco. My answer is, of course, “Yes, but also you should care.” The storytelling and character development are snappy and fast-paced, always ready to surprise you the moment you suspect it's falling into formula. Transforming into Muteking is a, well, transformative experience for Muteki as he comes to embrace his role as the dancing hero, and watching his relationships with the people around him is always fun. His romance subplot with Aida is less compelling and, to be honest, comes across as half-hearted compared to his bonds with DJ, Vivi, and the four siblings.    The story divides up neatly into three acts, and the final act is where it gets into trouble. The problem with telling a story that's an allegory for an ongoing social problem is eventually you have to resolve the conflict and create a satisfying conclusion. Gentrification by the technocracy and the homogenization of culture do not have tidy answers, or at least not ones that are fun to depict onscreen. Instead, the story descends into pure spectacle, embracing tokusatsu tropes left and right without regard for coherence or thematic consistency. This wouldn't be so bad, but a lot of the twists at that point feel random, contrived, or cliché as the story builds to its climax. By the end, the threat may be eliminated, but a lot of emotional loose ends never get fully tied up.    In light of that mess of an ending, it's hard to say whether or not I'd fully recommend Muteking the Dancing Hero. It's certainly a fun show, but what's more, its themes may hit hard depending on your life experiences. While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade. I've watched the gay clubs and watering holes in the historic LGBT neighborhood be replaced with wine bars and upscale apartment buildings as the area becomes less safe for people to be who they are. Almost every house on my block is being knocked down and replaced with identical glossy, expensive townhouses. Muteking recognizes the damage that does to a city, but just doesn't know what to do with it.

Review:         Synopsis:        The city of Neo-San Francisco is being threatened! The evil corporation OctInq, led by the CEO Seo, has been luring consumers into buying its luxury products with slick marketing, transforming them into goo. Luckily, Muteki has just moved to the city. When he hears his friend DJ's sick beats, he transforms into Muteking, the Dancing Hero, to defeat the evil and return the goo back to their human forms.     Review:            If you haven't seen a single episode of Muteking the Dancing Hero, you may think I'm making it up, or that I'm imposing Western values onto the show when I say that it's about how technocrats have gentrified San Francisco. You may think there's no way a remake of a cheesy 1980s tokusatsu anime is specifically about an issue occurring in a specific American city, or that there's some kind of allegory I'm missing, or that they're just telling a story they think is fun with no message. However, watch an episode or two and it becomes abundantly transparent that there is no subtlety to the clear and direct parallels between the show's story and what is happening in real life.    It's not unprecedented either; Muteking is one of a long line of Tatsunoko reimaginings that tackles matters of social injustice, the most famous example being Gatchaman Crowds and its sequel Insight. It telegraphs its intent clearly from the very start, when Muteki arrives in Neo San Francisco. He tries to stop for food at a fast food joint painted and decorated all in black, a sharp contrast to the colorful cityscape around him. On his way to his grandmother's, he catches a public broadcast by Seo, the Steve Jobs-esque CEO of the tech company OctInq – an obvious analog to Apple – announcing their new portable music device and encouraging everyone to throw away their Walkmans and boomboxes. Throughout the show, Seo introduces a number of tech-driven schemes spoofing on trends like wellness retreats and gimmicky restaurants, all designed to melt the people of Neo-San Francisco into a literal blob of complacency, furthering OctInq's nefarious ends. Muteki transforms into Muteking via his boombox-wielding friend DJ's DJing, roller skates around while singing, and in the end defeats the blob and returns the people back to normal.    The first four episodes follow a fairly simple structure, with Muteki transforming toward the end of the last half of each episode, doing his song and dance as Muteking, and defeating the villain without much effort. This adherence to formula in the latter half of the episodes – and the ease with which Muteking wins – leave Muteki free to explore the vibrancy of Neo San Francisco, meet new people, and grow as a person. He develops a crush on Aida, the waitress at a local diner, and befriends a group of siblings who hang out at a run-down arcade, and its proprietress Vivi.    The setting seems to have been designed by someone with a great love of and nostalgia for San Francisco before the tech companies moved in. The areas where OctInq have yet to take hold are awash in bright colors, populated by artists and folks in alternative dress, many of whom are visibly and unabashedly queer and gender non-conforming. The dismal black-and-gray color scheme of OctInq is a direct criticism of the “sleek minimalism” aesthetic pushed by tech companies, and may even be inspired by “gentrifier gray,” a cool gray tone popular with property owners in San Francisco for painting over units in once-colorful neighborhoods. Much like in reality, once-thriving neighborhoods like the one where Vivi's arcade resides have become empty and depressing.

Almost every house on my block is being knocked down and replaced with identical glossy, expensive townhouses. Muteking recognizes the damage that does to a city, but just doesn't know what to do with it.

Review:         Synopsis:        The city of Neo-San Francisco is being threatened! The evil corporation OctInq, led by the CEO Seo, has been luring consumers into buying its luxury products with slick marketing, transforming them into goo. Luckily, Muteki has just moved to the city. When he hears his friend DJ's sick beats, he transforms into Muteking, the Dancing Hero, to defeat the evil and return the goo back to their human forms.     Review:            If you haven't seen a single episode of Muteking the Dancing Hero, you may think I'm making it up, or that I'm imposing Western values onto the show when I say that it's about how technocrats have gentrified San Francisco. You may think there's no way a remake of a cheesy 1980s tokusatsu anime is specifically about an issue occurring in a specific American city, or that there's some kind of allegory I'm missing, or that they're just telling a story they think is fun with no message. However, watch an episode or two and it becomes abundantly transparent that there is no subtlety to the clear and direct parallels between the show's story and what is happening in real life.    It's not unprecedented either; Muteking is one of a long line of Tatsunoko reimaginings that tackles matters of social injustice, the most famous example being Gatchaman Crowds and its sequel Insight. It telegraphs its intent clearly from the very start, when Muteki arrives in Neo San Francisco. He tries to stop for food at a fast food joint painted and decorated all in black, a sharp contrast to the colorful cityscape around him. On his way to his grandmother's, he catches a public broadcast by Seo, the Steve Jobs-esque CEO of the tech company OctInq – an obvious analog to Apple – announcing their new portable music device and encouraging everyone to throw away their Walkmans and boomboxes. Throughout the show, Seo introduces a number of tech-driven schemes spoofing on trends like wellness retreats and gimmicky restaurants, all designed to melt the people of Neo-San Francisco into a literal blob of complacency, furthering OctInq's nefarious ends. Muteki transforms into Muteking via his boombox-wielding friend DJ's DJing, roller skates around while singing, and in the end defeats the blob and returns the people back to normal.    The first four episodes follow a fairly simple structure, with Muteki transforming toward the end of the last half of each episode, doing his song and dance as Muteking, and defeating the villain without much effort. This adherence to formula in the latter half of the episodes – and the ease with which Muteking wins – leave Muteki free to explore the vibrancy of Neo San Francisco, meet new people, and grow as a person. He develops a crush on Aida, the waitress at a local diner, and befriends a group of siblings who hang out at a run-down arcade, and its proprietress Vivi.    The setting seems to have been designed by someone with a great love of and nostalgia for San Francisco before the tech companies moved in. The areas where OctInq have yet to take hold are awash in bright colors, populated by artists and folks in alternative dress, many of whom are visibly and unabashedly queer and gender non-conforming. The dismal black-and-gray color scheme of OctInq is a direct criticism of the “sleek minimalism” aesthetic pushed by tech companies, and may even be inspired by “gentrifier gray,” a cool gray tone popular with property owners in San Francisco for painting over units in once-colorful neighborhoods. Much like in reality, once-thriving neighborhoods like the one where Vivi's arcade resides have become empty and depressing. It is, perhaps, an over-romanticization of San Francisco's past, when the city has always been rife with issues, but it is earnest and endearing to see nonetheless.    As one would expect from a series with the word “dancing” in the title, music plays a huge role in the series. The opening and ending are both certifiable bops with great visuals to go along with them; the former in particular tends to get stuck in my head for days, but to be honest I rarely ever mind; it's just that good. The diegetic music is strong as well, with a variety of genres ranging from the old-school tokusatsu charm of Muteking's theme song to the electronica of the EDM singer Aurora. At least I think it's EDM; I know nothing about electronic music outside of synthpop and keytars… It does sometimes feel judgmental about what the story considers good, creative music versus engineered, corporate music, but that's a relatively minor quibble.    By now, you may be wondering if there's anything to be gotten out of the show if you don't care about gentrification, the looming technocracy, or San Francisco. My answer is, of course, “Yes, but also you should care.” The storytelling and character development are snappy and fast-paced, always ready to surprise you the moment you suspect it's falling into formula. Transforming into Muteking is a, well, transformative experience for Muteki as he comes to embrace his role as the dancing hero, and watching his relationships with the people around him is always fun. His romance subplot with Aida is less compelling and, to be honest, comes across as half-hearted compared to his bonds with DJ, Vivi, and the four siblings.    The story divides up neatly into three acts, and the final act is where it gets into trouble. The problem with telling a story that's an allegory for an ongoing social problem is eventually you have to resolve the conflict and create a satisfying conclusion. Gentrification by the technocracy and the homogenization of culture do not have tidy answers, or at least not ones that are fun to depict onscreen. Instead, the story descends into pure spectacle, embracing tokusatsu tropes left and right without regard for coherence or thematic consistency. This wouldn't be so bad, but a lot of the twists at that point feel random, contrived, or cliché as the story builds to its climax. By the end, the threat may be eliminated, but a lot of emotional loose ends never get fully tied up.    In light of that mess of an ending, it's hard to say whether or not I'd fully recommend Muteking the Dancing Hero. It's certainly a fun show, but what's more, its themes may hit hard depending on your life experiences.

Is Aharen San supposed to be viewed as being on the autism spectrum? Because a lot of her behavior reminds me a lot of people who are on the spectrum      Back to top                   MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3992       Posted: Sun Apr 17, 2022 11:36 am            This show is really sold on the comedic interplay between Raido and Aharen, with Raid's wholesome personality, ditziness, and flights of fancy, and Aharen being so stoic, exaggerated, and yet oddly sweet. Takuma Terashima and Inori Minase also play off each other very well.    I also love how they went ahead and did a full ED sequence on Aharen's dance.

So much great comedy moments...Raido inconsolable after the movie (even Aharen cried!), the freestyle rapping communicating, fidget-spinner Aharen and Raido being worried about her future, Raido worried that everything was trying to kill them, and Raido trying to save face after losing to a little girl in Reversi.   Also look at Aharen trying to support childhood friend romances!   Aharen summoning her dog to carry her is the most Aharen-thing ever.

Takuma Terashima and Inori Minase also play off each other very well.    I also love how they went ahead and did a full ED sequence on Aharen's dance.

Takuma Terashima and Inori Minase also play off each other very well.    I also love how they went ahead and did a full ED sequence on Aharen's dance.

I would say no to her being Autistic, as most women who get it tend to be on the very low end of the Spectrum (non-verbal, violent fits, biting). Aharen shows none of those aspects. She could have Asperger’s, but definitely not straight-up Autism.

She could have Asperger’s, but definitely not straight-up Autism.           Asperger's Syndrome doesn't technically exist anymore. It's been folded into the general Autism Spectrum Disorder, or ASD as of 2013 (in the US), and 2022 (worldwide). Also, the argument that women tend to be on the low end of the spectrum strikes me as rather off, to say the least. Women ""hide"" their symptoms better than men because society expects them to. It's not abnormal for men to be bad at communication, or be bad at expressing/reading emotion or social cues. But it's considered an aberration for a woman to do so, and they're forced to adapt, so their symptoms don't display the same way.   As far as the OP goes, Aharen does have neuro divergent traits, but they're almost definitely not going to be acknowledged as anything more than her personality.

Still, that teeny tiny upturn he managed did melt my heart.

So much great comedy moments...Raido inconsolable after the movie (even Aharen cried!), the freestyle rapping communicating, fidget-spinner Aharen and Raido being worried about her future, Raido worried that everything was trying to kill them, and Raido trying to save face after losing to a little girl in Reversi.   Also look at Aharen trying to support childhood friend romances!   Aharen summoning her dog to carry her is the most Aharen-thing ever.

Is Aharen San supposed to be viewed as being on the autism spectrum? Because a lot of her behavior reminds me a lot of people who are on the spectrum      Back to top                   MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3992       Posted: Sun Apr 17, 2022 11:36 am            This show is really sold on the comedic interplay between Raido and Aharen, with Raid's wholesome personality, ditziness, and flights of fancy, and Aharen being so stoic, exaggerated, and yet oddly sweet. Takuma Terashima and Inori Minase also play off each other very well.    I also love how they went ahead and did a full ED sequence on Aharen's dance.

I would say no to her being Autistic, as most women who get it tend to be on the very low end of the Spectrum (non-verbal, violent fits, biting). Aharen shows none of those aspects. She could have Asperger’s, but definitely not straight-up Autism.

She could have Asperger’s, but definitely not straight-up Autism.           Asperger's Syndrome doesn't technically exist anymore. It's been folded into the general Autism Spectrum Disorder, or ASD as of 2013 (in the US), and 2022 (worldwide). Also, the argument that women tend to be on the low end of the spectrum strikes me as rather off, to say the least. Women ""hide"" their symptoms better than men because society expects them to. It's not abnormal for men to be bad at communication, or be bad at expressing/reading emotion or social cues. But it's considered an aberration for a woman to do so, and they're forced to adapt, so their symptoms don't display the same way.   As far as the OP goes, Aharen does have neuro divergent traits, but they're almost definitely not going to be acknowledged as anything more than her personality.

Still, that teeny tiny upturn he managed did melt my heart.

So much great comedy moments...Raido inconsolable after the movie (even Aharen cried!), the freestyle rapping communicating, fidget-spinner Aharen and Raido being worried about her future, Raido worried that everything was trying to kill them, and Raido trying to save face after losing to a little girl in Reversi.   Also look at Aharen trying to support childhood friend romances!   Aharen summoning her dog to carry her is the most Aharen-thing ever.
