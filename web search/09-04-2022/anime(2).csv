Tribe Nine Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Tribe Nine ?                     Community score: 3.7            Time to get ready to play ball, which is coincidentally the title of Tribe Nine's grand slam of a finale (that is, “PLAY BALL” in all caps) to what I can only assume will be a one cour project as, spoiler alert: it has very little baseball, actually. But there's lots and lots of feelings.    Ojiro goes full mask off (as in, he literally takes off his mask) this week, taking on the Minato Tribe in a face-to-face battle that's full of twists and turns, including a good bit of betrayal. I love a last-minute heel turn (with GUNS!), even if it's crammed into twenty-four minutes of not the best paced scripting. But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?    There is so much crammed into this episode: there's flashbacks and XB fights (and even more almost XB fights) and character growth and character deconstruction. It's all a lot, and it's not necessarily well-structured. It is fairly interesting, but maybe, in another series it would be well-executed and not feel like Tribe Nine was trying to tie up a bunch of loose ends. It ultimately feels messy, and when the resolution comes it's expected, which is really all I can say.    And since we're here, let's talk about resolutions.    I can easily say I'll be leaving the series with a solid sense of closure and a bit of optimism, which is nice, but unexpected. I genuinely thought I'd be leaving with some sort of “now go play the mobile game” bait, but instead we get an ending that feels about as good as you can expect from a show that's gone through some very high highs and extremely low lows like Tribe Nine has, cliffhangers included.    And goodness me, has this show gone through it over the past few weeks.    But where the show lands -and actually sticks the landing- is on the notion of fun. Part of why XB is so engaging for the late Shun Kamiya, and now, for Haru, is because it's a game. XB thrives when that's at the core: when it becomes a knock down, drag out battle, the game loses it's enjoyment. And it's actually this return to fun by Haru -who literally throws hands this episode- that actually kind of had me smiling in the end because say what you will, this show stays the course with its overall message, roiling the world of XB and Neo Tokyo by Game Over-ing some characters. (Or are they alive? Here's the thing, I genuinely don't know.)    Tribe Nine is a series that I don't regret spending time with, if only because of my insatiable desire to devour everything Kazutaka Kodaka lays his hands on. I just kind of can't help myself: every since I played Danganronpa in grad school, I've been very into everything he makes. Tribe Nine is the fast food of anime. It is is the 7-11 pizza slice of the animation world. Will it do in a pinch? Yeah, of course, but is it exactly what I wanted?    No, not at all.    There was a lot of mixed feelings as the credits rolled: I tried to reflect on what drew me to this show outside of my desire to kin my personality into every single Danganronpa character. Thinking back, it was a desire to see  a sports anime that was fun, and to a degree Tribe Nine was, at least initially. That said, I know there was an audience for this series, and I really hope that if you're that audience, you enjoyed it. Truth be told, that's always my wish for shows that I'm reviewing, whether or not I like them in the end: I hope that they brought enjoyment to as many people as possible. I'm a bit on both sides of the fence with my enjoyment, but honestly I can safely conclude this review saying that this anime is perfectly okay, and that's okay in and of itself. Every season needs its C-minus grade anime, and Tribe Nine?    Well, it's a grand slam in that category.    Rating:              because this was so close to four stars, but just never got there       Tribe Nine is currently streaming on Funimation.    Mercedez is a JP-EN translation and localization light novel editor & proofreader/QA, pop culture critic, and a journalist who, when not writing for ANN, writes for Anime Feminist, where they're a staff editor. They're also a frequent cohost on the Anime Feminist Podcast, Chatty AF. This season, they're reflecting on their youth with Akebi's Sailor Uniform. When they're not writing and reviewing, you can find them on their  Twitter or on their  Instagram where she's always up to something.   <prevEpisode 1-3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episodes 6-7 Episode 8 Episode 9 Episode 10 Episode 11 Episode 12     discuss this in the forum (19 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to Tribe Nine Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Tribe Nine Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Tribe Nine ?                     Community score: 3.7            Time to get ready to play ball, which is coincidentally the title of Tribe Nine's grand slam of a finale (that is, “PLAY BALL” in all caps) to what I can only assume will be a one cour project as, spoiler alert: it has very little baseball, actually. But there's lots and lots of feelings.    Ojiro goes full mask off (as in, he literally takes off his mask) this week, taking on the Minato Tribe in a face-to-face battle that's full of twists and turns, including a good bit of betrayal. I love a last-minute heel turn (with GUNS!), even if it's crammed into twenty-four minutes of not the best paced scripting. But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?    There is so much crammed into this episode: there's flashbacks and XB fights (and even more almost XB fights) and character growth and character deconstruction. It's all a lot, and it's not necessarily well-structured. It is fairly interesting, but maybe, in another series it would be well-executed and not feel like Tribe Nine was trying to tie up a bunch of loose ends. It ultimately feels messy, and when the resolution comes it's expected, which is really all I can say.    And since we're here, let's talk about resolutions.    I can easily say I'll be leaving the series with a solid sense of closure and a bit of optimism, which is nice, but unexpected. I genuinely thought I'd be leaving with some sort of “now go play the mobile game” bait, but instead we get an ending that feels about as good as you can expect from a show that's gone through some very high highs and extremely low lows like Tribe Nine has, cliffhangers included.    And goodness me, has this show gone through it over the past few weeks.    But where the show lands -and actually sticks the landing- is on the notion of fun. Part of why XB is so engaging for the late Shun Kamiya, and now, for Haru, is because it's a game. XB thrives when that's at the core: when it becomes a knock down, drag out battle, the game loses it's enjoyment. And it's actually this return to fun by Haru -who literally throws hands this episode- that actually kind of had me smiling in the end because say what you will, this show stays the course with its overall message, roiling the world of XB and Neo Tokyo by Game Over-ing some characters. (Or are they alive? Here's the thing, I genuinely don't know.)    Tribe Nine is a series that I don't regret spending time with, if only because of my insatiable desire to devour everything Kazutaka Kodaka lays his hands on. I just kind of can't help myself: every since I played Danganronpa in grad school, I've been very into everything he makes. Tribe Nine is the fast food of anime. It is is the 7-11 pizza slice of the animation world. Will it do in a pinch? Yeah, of course, but is it exactly what I wanted?    No, not at all.    There was a lot of mixed feelings as the credits rolled: I tried to reflect on what drew me to this show outside of my desire to kin my personality into every single Danganronpa character. Thinking back, it was a desire to see  a sports anime that was fun, and to a degree Tribe Nine was, at least initially. That said, I know there was an audience for this series, and I really hope that if you're that audience, you enjoyed it. Truth be told, that's always my wish for shows that I'm reviewing, whether or not I like them in the end: I hope that they brought enjoyment to as many people as possible. I'm a bit on both sides of the fence with my enjoyment, but honestly I can safely conclude this review saying that this anime is perfectly okay, and that's okay in and of itself. Every season needs its C-minus grade anime, and Tribe Nine?    Well, it's a grand slam in that category.    Rating:              because this was so close to four stars, but just never got there       Tribe Nine is currently streaming on Funimation.    Mercedez is a JP-EN translation and localization light novel editor & proofreader/QA, pop culture critic, and a journalist who, when not writing for ANN, writes for Anime Feminist, where they're a staff editor. They're also a frequent cohost on the Anime Feminist Podcast, Chatty AF. This season, they're reflecting on their youth with Akebi's Sailor Uniform. When they're not writing and reviewing, you can find them on their  Twitter or on their  Instagram where she's always up to something.   <prevEpisode 1-3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episodes 6-7 Episode 8 Episode 9 Episode 10 Episode 11 Episode 12     discuss this in the forum (19 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to Tribe Nine Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Tribe Nine Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Tribe Nine ?                     Community score: 3.7            Time to get ready to play ball, which is coincidentally the title of Tribe Nine's grand slam of a finale (that is, “PLAY BALL” in all caps) to what I can only assume will be a one cour project as, spoiler alert: it has very little baseball, actually. But there's lots and lots of feelings.    Ojiro goes full mask off (as in, he literally takes off his mask) this week, taking on the Minato Tribe in a face-to-face battle that's full of twists and turns, including a good bit of betrayal. I love a last-minute heel turn (with GUNS!), even if it's crammed into twenty-four minutes of not the best paced scripting. But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?    There is so much crammed into this episode: there's flashbacks and XB fights (and even more almost XB fights) and character growth and character deconstruction. It's all a lot, and it's not necessarily well-structured. It is fairly interesting, but maybe, in another series it would be well-executed and not feel like Tribe Nine was trying to tie up a bunch of loose ends. It ultimately feels messy, and when the resolution comes it's expected, which is really all I can say.    And since we're here, let's talk about resolutions.    I can easily say I'll be leaving the series with a solid sense of closure and a bit of optimism, which is nice, but unexpected. I genuinely thought I'd be leaving with some sort of “now go play the mobile game” bait, but instead we get an ending that feels about as good as you can expect from a show that's gone through some very high highs and extremely low lows like Tribe Nine has, cliffhangers included.    And goodness me, has this show gone through it over the past few weeks.    But where the show lands -and actually sticks the landing- is on the notion of fun. Part of why XB is so engaging for the late Shun Kamiya, and now, for Haru, is because it's a game. XB thrives when that's at the core: when it becomes a knock down, drag out battle, the game loses it's enjoyment. And it's actually this return to fun by Haru -who literally throws hands this episode- that actually kind of had me smiling in the end because say what you will, this show stays the course with its overall message, roiling the world of XB and Neo Tokyo by Game Over-ing some characters. (Or are they alive? Here's the thing, I genuinely don't know.)    Tribe Nine is a series that I don't regret spending time with, if only because of my insatiable desire to devour everything Kazutaka Kodaka lays his hands on. I just kind of can't help myself: every since I played Danganronpa in grad school, I've been very into everything he makes. Tribe Nine is the fast food of anime. It is is the 7-11 pizza slice of the animation world. Will it do in a pinch? Yeah, of course, but is it exactly what I wanted?    No, not at all.    There was a lot of mixed feelings as the credits rolled: I tried to reflect on what drew me to this show outside of my desire to kin my personality into every single Danganronpa character. Thinking back, it was a desire to see  a sports anime that was fun, and to a degree Tribe Nine was, at least initially. That said, I know there was an audience for this series, and I really hope that if you're that audience, you enjoyed it. Truth be told, that's always my wish for shows that I'm reviewing, whether or not I like them in the end: I hope that they brought enjoyment to as many people as possible. I'm a bit on both sides of the fence with my enjoyment, but honestly I can safely conclude this review saying that this anime is perfectly okay, and that's okay in and of itself. Every season needs its C-minus grade anime, and Tribe Nine?    Well, it's a grand slam in that category.    Rating:              because this was so close to four stars, but just never got there       Tribe Nine is currently streaming on Funimation.    Mercedez is a JP-EN translation and localization light novel editor & proofreader/QA, pop culture critic, and a journalist who, when not writing for ANN, writes for Anime Feminist, where they're a staff editor. They're also a frequent cohost on the Anime Feminist Podcast, Chatty AF. This season, they're reflecting on their youth with Akebi's Sailor Uniform. When they're not writing and reviewing, you can find them on their  Twitter or on their  Instagram where she's always up to something.   <prevEpisode 1-3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episodes 6-7 Episode 8 Episode 9 Episode 10 Episode 11 Episode 12     discuss this in the forum (19 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to Tribe Nine Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

I genuinely thought I'd be leaving with some sort of “now go play the mobile game” bait, but instead we get an ending that feels about as good as you can expect from a show that's gone through some very high highs and extremely low lows like Tribe Nine has, cliffhangers included.    And goodness me, has this show gone through it over the past few weeks.    But where the show lands -and actually sticks the landing- is on the notion of fun. Part of why XB is so engaging for the late Shun Kamiya, and now, for Haru, is because it's a game. XB thrives when that's at the core: when it becomes a knock down, drag out battle, the game loses it's enjoyment. And it's actually this return to fun by Haru -who literally throws hands this episode- that actually kind of had me smiling in the end because say what you will, this show stays the course with its overall message, roiling the world of XB and Neo Tokyo by Game Over-ing some characters. (Or are they alive? Here's the thing, I genuinely don't know.)    Tribe Nine is a series that I don't regret spending time with, if only because of my insatiable desire to devour everything Kazutaka Kodaka lays his hands on. I just kind of can't help myself: every since I played Danganronpa in grad school, I've been very into everything he makes. Tribe Nine is the fast food of anime. It is is the 7-11 pizza slice of the animation world. Will it do in a pinch? Yeah, of course, but is it exactly what I wanted?    No, not at all.    There was a lot of mixed feelings as the credits rolled: I tried to reflect on what drew me to this show outside of my desire to kin my personality into every single Danganronpa character. Thinking back, it was a desire to see  a sports anime that was fun, and to a degree Tribe Nine was, at least initially. That said, I know there was an audience for this series, and I really hope that if you're that audience, you enjoyed it. Truth be told, that's always my wish for shows that I'm reviewing, whether or not I like them in the end: I hope that they brought enjoyment to as many people as possible. I'm a bit on both sides of the fence with my enjoyment, but honestly I can safely conclude this review saying that this anime is perfectly okay, and that's okay in and of itself. Every season needs its C-minus grade anime, and Tribe Nine?    Well, it's a grand slam in that category.

Tribe Nine Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Tribe Nine ?                     Community score: 3.7            Time to get ready to play ball, which is coincidentally the title of Tribe Nine's grand slam of a finale (that is, “PLAY BALL” in all caps) to what I can only assume will be a one cour project as, spoiler alert: it has very little baseball, actually. But there's lots and lots of feelings.    Ojiro goes full mask off (as in, he literally takes off his mask) this week, taking on the Minato Tribe in a face-to-face battle that's full of twists and turns, including a good bit of betrayal. I love a last-minute heel turn (with GUNS!), even if it's crammed into twenty-four minutes of not the best paced scripting. But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?    There is so much crammed into this episode: there's flashbacks and XB fights (and even more almost XB fights) and character growth and character deconstruction. It's all a lot, and it's not necessarily well-structured. It is fairly interesting, but maybe, in another series it would be well-executed and not feel like Tribe Nine was trying to tie up a bunch of loose ends. It ultimately feels messy, and when the resolution comes it's expected, which is really all I can say.    And since we're here, let's talk about resolutions.    I can easily say I'll be leaving the series with a solid sense of closure and a bit of optimism, which is nice, but unexpected. I genuinely thought I'd be leaving with some sort of “now go play the mobile game” bait, but instead we get an ending that feels about as good as you can expect from a show that's gone through some very high highs and extremely low lows like Tribe Nine has, cliffhangers included.    And goodness me, has this show gone through it over the past few weeks.    But where the show lands -and actually sticks the landing- is on the notion of fun.

Community score: 3.7            Time to get ready to play ball, which is coincidentally the title of Tribe Nine's grand slam of a finale (that is, “PLAY BALL” in all caps) to what I can only assume will be a one cour project as, spoiler alert: it has very little baseball, actually. But there's lots and lots of feelings.    Ojiro goes full mask off (as in, he literally takes off his mask) this week, taking on the Minato Tribe in a face-to-face battle that's full of twists and turns, including a good bit of betrayal. I love a last-minute heel turn (with GUNS!), even if it's crammed into twenty-four minutes of not the best paced scripting. But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?    There is so much crammed into this episode: there's flashbacks and XB fights (and even more almost XB fights) and character growth and character deconstruction. It's all a lot, and it's not necessarily well-structured. It is fairly interesting, but maybe, in another series it would be well-executed and not feel like Tribe Nine was trying to tie up a bunch of loose ends. It ultimately feels messy, and when the resolution comes it's expected, which is really all I can say.    And since we're here, let's talk about resolutions.    I can easily say I'll be leaving the series with a solid sense of closure and a bit of optimism, which is nice, but unexpected. I genuinely thought I'd be leaving with some sort of “now go play the mobile game” bait, but instead we get an ending that feels about as good as you can expect from a show that's gone through some very high highs and extremely low lows like Tribe Nine has, cliffhangers included.    And goodness me, has this show gone through it over the past few weeks.    But where the show lands -and actually sticks the landing- is on the notion of fun. Part of why XB is so engaging for the late Shun Kamiya, and now, for Haru, is because it's a game. XB thrives when that's at the core: when it becomes a knock down, drag out battle, the game loses it's enjoyment. And it's actually this return to fun by Haru -who literally throws hands this episode- that actually kind of had me smiling in the end because say what you will, this show stays the course with its overall message, roiling the world of XB and Neo Tokyo by Game Over-ing some characters. (Or are they alive? Here's the thing, I genuinely don't know.)    Tribe Nine is a series that I don't regret spending time with, if only because of my insatiable desire to devour everything Kazutaka Kodaka lays his hands on. I just kind of can't help myself: every since I played Danganronpa in grad school, I've been very into everything he makes. Tribe Nine is the fast food of anime. It is is the 7-11 pizza slice of the animation world. Will it do in a pinch? Yeah, of course, but is it exactly what I wanted?    No, not at all.    There was a lot of mixed feelings as the credits rolled: I tried to reflect on what drew me to this show outside of my desire to kin my personality into every single Danganronpa character. Thinking back, it was a desire to see  a sports anime that was fun, and to a degree Tribe Nine was, at least initially. That said, I know there was an audience for this series, and I really hope that if you're that audience, you enjoyed it. Truth be told, that's always my wish for shows that I'm reviewing, whether or not I like them in the end: I hope that they brought enjoyment to as many people as possible. I'm a bit on both sides of the fence with my enjoyment, but honestly I can safely conclude this review saying that this anime is perfectly okay, and that's okay in and of itself. Every season needs its C-minus grade anime, and Tribe Nine?    Well, it's a grand slam in that category.    Rating:              because this was so close to four stars, but just never got there       Tribe Nine is currently streaming on Funimation.    Mercedez is a JP-EN translation and localization light novel editor & proofreader/QA, pop culture critic, and a journalist who, when not writing for ANN, writes for Anime Feminist, where they're a staff editor.

Titles with many votes will tend to be at the top, but this is modified a little by the ratings.

Titles with many votes will tend to be at the top, but this is modified a little by the ratings. In other words, the popularity is the straight average score of a title (the value in the rating column) multiplied by the number of votes.

The bayesian estimate is a statistical technique used to reduce the noise due to low sample counts. In effect, the less a title has votes, the more it is pulled towards the mean (7.732). In other words, these are the titles that many people agree are awful.

Titles with less than 4 votes are removed from the list but are still counted in the ranking. This explains why there may be gaps in the ""#"" column.

Titles with many votes will tend to be at the top, but this is modified a little by the ratings. In other words, the popularity is the straight average score of a title (the value in the rating column) multiplied by the number of votes.

The rating displayed here is the same weighted average as the Top 10 Best Rated by weighted average, but is only displayed for reference and doesn't have anything to do with the order of the titles.

Based on the premise that titles deserve to be seen in equal proportion to how well rated they are, the value in the ""#"" column is the number of positions by which this title would climb in the Most Viewed list if it was seen as much as it was liked (according to bayesian rating).

If it is a VERY short form series with 3 to 5 minute episodes like  Master of Killing Time or Super Seisyun Brothers, fine. But I can't fathom 22 minutes for 13 episodes - or even 12 minutes like Tsuredure Children - where the content consists of a character just speculating. If it is school hi-jinks or if they have ninja missions with combat then why not promote that also?    I know, I could answer these questions by just checking out the source material, but that costs money (reserved for ""actually have an interest in reading"" not ""what on earth is going on in the first place?"").

Well, I guess packing as many middle school girls that aren't wearing a whole lot - because they're ninjas, and not something girly like idols or sketchy like models! - as possible and contains a bit of ""wink wink"" humor but still comes nowhere near ecchi is an excellent way to maximize readership among middle school boys. ""Hey kid want to look at a ton of pictures of an amazing variety of pretty girls that are about your age and laugh at a lot of silly 'just a little bit naughty' jokes without getting scolded by your parents or embarrassed at school? Well here you go!""    So yeah I can see why this would have been a real hit as a manga. I just don't see how to carry that over into a successful TV show.

I just don't see how to carry that over into a successful TV show.           it's based on a manga by Souichiro Yamamoto, an artist who has a strong fanbase thanks to Teasing Master Takagi, which is also a hit as an anime. You'd be a fool not to adapt Yamamoto's other works into animation, he's a golden goose right now.  I'vre read the original manga and I like it. It's a cute, inoffensive SoL comedy with great chemistry between the many girls. It's perfect for a feel good romcom anime.

If it is a VERY short form series with 3 to 5 minute episodes like  Master of Killing Time or Super Seisyun Brothers, fine. But I can't fathom 22 minutes for 13 episodes - or even 12 minutes like Tsuredure Children - where the content consists of a character just speculating. If it is school hi-jinks or if they have ninja missions with combat then why not promote that also?    I know, I could answer these questions by just checking out the source material, but that costs money (reserved for ""actually have an interest in reading"" not ""what on earth is going on in the first place?"").

I just don't see how to carry that over into a successful TV show.           it's based on a manga by Souichiro Yamamoto, an artist who has a strong fanbase thanks to Teasing Master Takagi, which is also a hit as an anime. You'd be a fool not to adapt Yamamoto's other works into animation, he's a golden goose right now.  I'vre read the original manga and I like it. It's a cute, inoffensive SoL comedy with great chemistry between the many girls. It's perfect for a feel good romcom anime.

""Hey kid want to look at a ton of pictures of an amazing variety of pretty girls that are about your age and laugh at a lot of silly 'just a little bit naughty' jokes without getting scolded by your parents or embarrassed at school? Well here you go!""    So yeah I can see why this would have been a real hit as a manga. I just don't see how to carry that over into a successful TV show.

I just don't see how to carry that over into a successful TV show.           it's based on a manga by Souichiro Yamamoto, an artist who has a strong fanbase thanks to Teasing Master Takagi, which is also a hit as an anime. You'd be a fool not to adapt Yamamoto's other works into animation, he's a golden goose right now.  I'vre read the original manga and I like it. It's a cute, inoffensive SoL comedy with great chemistry between the many girls. It's perfect for a feel good romcom anime.

If it is a VERY short form series with 3 to 5 minute episodes like  Master of Killing Time or Super Seisyun Brothers, fine. But I can't fathom 22 minutes for 13 episodes - or even 12 minutes like Tsuredure Children - where the content consists of a character just speculating. If it is school hi-jinks or if they have ninja missions with combat then why not promote that also?    I know, I could answer these questions by just checking out the source material, but that costs money (reserved for ""actually have an interest in reading"" not ""what on earth is going on in the first place?"").

Go global together! “Nothing is Impossible!”  With the strongest members from Japan to the world, a boy band audition to discover the next superstar - produced by YOSHIKI.  “YOSHIKI SUPERSTAR PROJECT X” We've got massive response, with some days receiving about 1,000 applications! With number of demands for extension of the application period, we've decided to accept additional applicants! Group (multiple-member) application is also accepted!  The detail of the audition is being revealed gradually! Two groups may debut - a dance & vocal group, and a band. Worldclass specialists from different genre will be gathered as a training team!  “YOSHIKI SUPERSTAR PROJECT X” - YOSHIKI as a producer, the audition to find and develop the world's next iconic a boy band will be accepting additional applicants starting noon on Monday, April 11. This time in response to many inquiries, applicant as a band or a group is also accepted.  During the online meeting on March 31 between YOSHIKI in LA and NTV audition staff broadcasted live on “YOSHIKI CHANNEL,” they discussed about the day they received about 1,000 applications in a single day, and also about the messages they were receiving such as “application period is too short,” “I'm not sure what kind of video to take,” and so on. In response, YOSHIKI brought up an idea of additional call for application, and the details were released today.  Also during the program, YOSHIKI expressed his vision about the group saying, “I have a feeling two different groups may debut; a dance & vocal group and a band.” He also said, “After meeting applicants in person, my ideas may change - and in that sense, this audition is a collaboration of applicants and us.” He also quoted about his detailed plans about their debut, “At this point, we're looking at the timing sometime between the end of this year and spring, and I also want to prepare the right stage for that day.”  About the training team for the group, YOSHIKI says “I'm reaching out to worldwide specialists in various genre: for instance, people like fashion experts and voice trainers.” YOSHIKI has lived in Hollywood for some time and has a wide network of contacts worldwide, and therefore a strongest team possible is planned to be put together.  YOSHIKI seems to be gradually watching the performances of the applicants. He comments,“Maybe I can set aside some time to watch all the performances with a hachimaki wrapped around my head (laugh)!” He also shared his surprising episode of him meeting an applicant who was a staff of the restaurant he went in LA.  For upcoming auditions, he's now trying to set his schedule so that he can meet the applicants in person. As of the selection criteria, according to YOSHIKI, “ I will be cooperating with specialists of each genre, but I am an artist myself and also a producer, and I do wide range of music from rock to classic. So, for instance, I may notice something other great producers may not notice. From the perspective as a rock musician, I may find things in a dance & vocal group which professional dancers may not find. I have confidence in my keen eye for finding new talent.”  To this day, YOSHIKI has challenged “the existing concept of what is normal” and created a new era. With his keen eye to find true talent, this time as a producer, we can't wait to see how he will deal with the applicants, with what kind of criteria he uses for selection, and finally, what kind of a boy band he will produce – this reality show sets itself apart from the many other audition programs looking for new talents.  With strongest members from Japan to the world – “YOSHIKI SUPERSTAR PROJECT X” – YOSHIKI as a producer, this competition series will be aired on “Sukkiri” and “Gyoretsu no dekiru sodanjo” (NTV) and also streamed on Hulu. Please check our official website for details on additional applications, beginning noon on Monday, April 11.  ≪YOSHIKI's comment≫ Thank you for all of you who already applied. We are finding lots of wonderful performances. As I have experienced, going through audition is a tough procedure, forcing you to compete. You need to be strong mentally, and there will be number of challenges you'll face. It's so easy to give up, but including myself, I chose the tough way and moving forward on this path. I look forward to meeting such people through this audition.  As in the title “Superstar,” our staff and I are all working together so we can bring out a superstar to the world, so even if you aren't sure about yourself, please don't hesitate! I am so excited to meet all of you.  ≪Audition Outline≫  Audition name: “YOSHIKI SUPERSTAR PROJECT X” First recruitment for a boy band: March 1 ~ March 31, 2022 (application now closed) Additional recruitment for a boy band: Monday, April 11 noon ~ Friday, May 20 23:59 Official website: https://yoshikisuperstar.com/en/ Official Twitter: @ YOSHIKI_s_star Official Instagram: @yoshikisuperstar Official TikTok: @yoshikisuperstar     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Press Release homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Go global together! “Nothing is Impossible!”  With the strongest members from Japan to the world, a boy band audition to discover the next superstar - produced by YOSHIKI.  “YOSHIKI SUPERSTAR PROJECT X” We've got massive response, with some days receiving about 1,000 applications! With number of demands for extension of the application period, we've decided to accept additional applicants! Group (multiple-member) application is also accepted!  The detail of the audition is being revealed gradually! Two groups may debut - a dance & vocal group, and a band. Worldclass specialists from different genre will be gathered as a training team!  “YOSHIKI SUPERSTAR PROJECT X” - YOSHIKI as a producer, the audition to find and develop the world's next iconic a boy band will be accepting additional applicants starting noon on Monday, April 11. This time in response to many inquiries, applicant as a band or a group is also accepted.  During the online meeting on March 31 between YOSHIKI in LA and NTV audition staff broadcasted live on “YOSHIKI CHANNEL,” they discussed about the day they received about 1,000 applications in a single day, and also about the messages they were receiving such as “application period is too short,” “I'm not sure what kind of video to take,” and so on. In response, YOSHIKI brought up an idea of additional call for application, and the details were released today.  Also during the program, YOSHIKI expressed his vision about the group saying, “I have a feeling two different groups may debut; a dance & vocal group and a band.” He also said, “After meeting applicants in person, my ideas may change - and in that sense, this audition is a collaboration of applicants and us.” He also quoted about his detailed plans about their debut, “At this point, we're looking at the timing sometime between the end of this year and spring, and I also want to prepare the right stage for that day.”  About the training team for the group, YOSHIKI says “I'm reaching out to worldwide specialists in various genre: for instance, people like fashion experts and voice trainers.” YOSHIKI has lived in Hollywood for some time and has a wide network of contacts worldwide, and therefore a strongest team possible is planned to be put together.  YOSHIKI seems to be gradually watching the performances of the applicants. He comments,“Maybe I can set aside some time to watch all the performances with a hachimaki wrapped around my head (laugh)!” He also shared his surprising episode of him meeting an applicant who was a staff of the restaurant he went in LA.  For upcoming auditions, he's now trying to set his schedule so that he can meet the applicants in person. As of the selection criteria, according to YOSHIKI, “ I will be cooperating with specialists of each genre, but I am an artist myself and also a producer, and I do wide range of music from rock to classic. So, for instance, I may notice something other great producers may not notice. From the perspective as a rock musician, I may find things in a dance & vocal group which professional dancers may not find. I have confidence in my keen eye for finding new talent.”  To this day, YOSHIKI has challenged “the existing concept of what is normal” and created a new era. With his keen eye to find true talent, this time as a producer, we can't wait to see how he will deal with the applicants, with what kind of criteria he uses for selection, and finally, what kind of a boy band he will produce – this reality show sets itself apart from the many other audition programs looking for new talents.  With strongest members from Japan to the world – “YOSHIKI SUPERSTAR PROJECT X” – YOSHIKI as a producer, this competition series will be aired on “Sukkiri” and “Gyoretsu no dekiru sodanjo” (NTV) and also streamed on Hulu. Please check our official website for details on additional applications, beginning noon on Monday, April 11.  ≪YOSHIKI's comment≫ Thank you for all of you who already applied. We are finding lots of wonderful performances. As I have experienced, going through audition is a tough procedure, forcing you to compete. You need to be strong mentally, and there will be number of challenges you'll face. It's so easy to give up, but including myself, I chose the tough way and moving forward on this path. I look forward to meeting such people through this audition.  As in the title “Superstar,” our staff and I are all working together so we can bring out a superstar to the world, so even if you aren't sure about yourself, please don't hesitate! I am so excited to meet all of you.  ≪Audition Outline≫  Audition name: “YOSHIKI SUPERSTAR PROJECT X” First recruitment for a boy band: March 1 ~ March 31, 2022 (application now closed) Additional recruitment for a boy band: Monday, April 11 noon ~ Friday, May 20 23:59 Official website: https://yoshikisuperstar.com/en/ Official Twitter: @ YOSHIKI_s_star Official Instagram: @yoshikisuperstar Official TikTok: @yoshikisuperstar     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Press Release homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Go global together! “Nothing is Impossible!”  With the strongest members from Japan to the world, a boy band audition to discover the next superstar - produced by YOSHIKI.  “YOSHIKI SUPERSTAR PROJECT X” We've got massive response, with some days receiving about 1,000 applications! With number of demands for extension of the application period, we've decided to accept additional applicants! Group (multiple-member) application is also accepted!  The detail of the audition is being revealed gradually! Two groups may debut - a dance & vocal group, and a band. Worldclass specialists from different genre will be gathered as a training team!  “YOSHIKI SUPERSTAR PROJECT X” - YOSHIKI as a producer, the audition to find and develop the world's next iconic a boy band will be accepting additional applicants starting noon on Monday, April 11. This time in response to many inquiries, applicant as a band or a group is also accepted.  During the online meeting on March 31 between YOSHIKI in LA and NTV audition staff broadcasted live on “YOSHIKI CHANNEL,” they discussed about the day they received about 1,000 applications in a single day, and also about the messages they were receiving such as “application period is too short,” “I'm not sure what kind of video to take,” and so on. In response, YOSHIKI brought up an idea of additional call for application, and the details were released today.  Also during the program, YOSHIKI expressed his vision about the group saying, “I have a feeling two different groups may debut; a dance & vocal group and a band.” He also said, “After meeting applicants in person, my ideas may change - and in that sense, this audition is a collaboration of applicants and us.” He also quoted about his detailed plans about their debut, “At this point, we're looking at the timing sometime between the end of this year and spring, and I also want to prepare the right stage for that day.”  About the training team for the group, YOSHIKI says “I'm reaching out to worldwide specialists in various genre: for instance, people like fashion experts and voice trainers.” YOSHIKI has lived in Hollywood for some time and has a wide network of contacts worldwide, and therefore a strongest team possible is planned to be put together.  YOSHIKI seems to be gradually watching the performances of the applicants. He comments,“Maybe I can set aside some time to watch all the performances with a hachimaki wrapped around my head (laugh)!” He also shared his surprising episode of him meeting an applicant who was a staff of the restaurant he went in LA.  For upcoming auditions, he's now trying to set his schedule so that he can meet the applicants in person. As of the selection criteria, according to YOSHIKI, “ I will be cooperating with specialists of each genre, but I am an artist myself and also a producer, and I do wide range of music from rock to classic. So, for instance, I may notice something other great producers may not notice. From the perspective as a rock musician, I may find things in a dance & vocal group which professional dancers may not find. I have confidence in my keen eye for finding new talent.”  To this day, YOSHIKI has challenged “the existing concept of what is normal” and created a new era. With his keen eye to find true talent, this time as a producer, we can't wait to see how he will deal with the applicants, with what kind of criteria he uses for selection, and finally, what kind of a boy band he will produce – this reality show sets itself apart from the many other audition programs looking for new talents.  With strongest members from Japan to the world – “YOSHIKI SUPERSTAR PROJECT X” – YOSHIKI as a producer, this competition series will be aired on “Sukkiri” and “Gyoretsu no dekiru sodanjo” (NTV) and also streamed on Hulu. Please check our official website for details on additional applications, beginning noon on Monday, April 11.  ≪YOSHIKI's comment≫ Thank you for all of you who already applied. We are finding lots of wonderful performances. As I have experienced, going through audition is a tough procedure, forcing you to compete. You need to be strong mentally, and there will be number of challenges you'll face. It's so easy to give up, but including myself, I chose the tough way and moving forward on this path. I look forward to meeting such people through this audition.  As in the title “Superstar,” our staff and I are all working together so we can bring out a superstar to the world, so even if you aren't sure about yourself, please don't hesitate! I am so excited to meet all of you.  ≪Audition Outline≫  Audition name: “YOSHIKI SUPERSTAR PROJECT X” First recruitment for a boy band: March 1 ~ March 31, 2022 (application now closed) Additional recruitment for a boy band: Monday, April 11 noon ~ Friday, May 20 23:59 Official website: https://yoshikisuperstar.com/en/ Official Twitter: @ YOSHIKI_s_star Official Instagram: @yoshikisuperstar Official TikTok: @yoshikisuperstar     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Press Release homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

If you skipped over Revue Starlight or Karakai Jozu no Takagi-san whe...                    column          8 comments       Shelf Life - Kokkoku   2019 May  7, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    Paul reviews this time-stopping supernatural thriller and breaks down all this week's new blu-ray releases! ―  We're coming up on the season for final exams, and for those of us who work in college libraries, that means interacting with a lot of panicked undergrads who haven't set foot in a library since their first tour of the campus. Luckily for me, I'm well practiced in the art of not making snark...                    column          4 comments       Shelf Life - Garo: Vanishing Line part 2   2019 Apr 30, 01:00 4 comments                 anime    Gabriella reviews the final chapter of this wild gothic horror road trip on blu-ray, while Paul breaks down all this week's new anime releases! ―  I picked up the new Ace Combat game on sale last week, and despite not having played anything in that genre since the previous console generation, I'm actually still decent at flying an imaginary plane.

There is not enough caffeine in the world to overcome the crushing realization of ""I was just here a few ...                    column          11 comments       Shelf Life - Galaxy Express 999: The Movie   2019 Apr  9, 01:00 11 comments                 anime    Paul reviews this Leiji Matsumoto classic on blu-ray and breaks down all this week's new anime releases! ―  Hey, it's Preview Guide time again! I'm taking a break this season, but the rest of the crew has all this season's new shows covered. I'm expecting the new Fruits Basket adaptation to be the big show this time around, but you never know when some obscure series is going to come out of nowhere a...                    column          6 comments       Shelf Life - Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru Season 2   2019 Apr  2, 02:00 6 comments                 anime    Paul takes on a whole warehouse full of historical sword boys in the second season of Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru, plus all of this week's new anime bluray releases! ―  To follow up on my intro from a couple weeks ago, I did buy the new Fate video game, and it had the desired effect of finally pulling me away from the mobile game. My login streak remains unbroken, though, because you can't not keep up you...                    column          11 comments       Shelf Life - Mitsuboshi Colors   2019 Mar 26, 00:00 11 comments                 anime    Paul snuggles up with an adorable slice-of-life series about mischievous ragamuffins and breaks down this week's huge slate of new blu-ray releases! ―  The good news: Cells at Work is getting a second season!

Not because I don't already have a huge gaming backlog to deal with, but because I need an excuse to finally take a break from the Fate smartphone game. A pers...                    column          12 comments       Shelf Life - Garo: Vanishing Line   2019 Mar 12, 00:00 12 comments                 anime    The Golden Armor returns once more for the wildly entertaining Garo: Vanishing Line part 1. Plus: all of this week's new anime DVD & Bluray releases! ―  I lent my copy of the Tomorrow's Joe movie to a friend months ago, and he still hasn't watched it, let alone returned it. This is fine, however, because watching him confess his crushing guilt on a weekly basis is providing me with more entertainment...                    column          9 comments       Shelf Life - Just Because!   2019 Mar  5, 02:00 9 comments                 anime    James dives into the turbulent waters of mushy teen romance with this curiously named series, while Paul breaks down all this week's new blu-ray releases! ―  This season is shaping up to be a good one for comedies. The Quintessential Quintuplets is proving that an old-fashioned harem comedy can still be entertaining, Kaguya-sama: Love is War is excellent across the board, and I guess Domestic Girlfri...                    column          4 comments       Shelf Life - Urahara   2019 Feb 26, 01:00 4 comments                 anime    Gabriella takes a look at an underrated magical girl show that takes place in the streets of Harajuku, while Paul runs down all this week's new blu-ray releases! ―  Ever wake up on a Saturday and realize the last seven days have all been a blur? That happened to me this week.

I can already tell I'm going to go back through this show a second or thi...                    column          8 comments       Shelf Life - King's Game   2019 Feb 12, 06:31 8 comments                 anime    Paul subjects himself to one of the most hilariously bad entries in survival game horror, along with all this week's new blu-ray releases. ―  I've had all kinds of problems getting my anime streaming apps to work lately, but at least this has given me an excuse to binge some nature documentaries. And yes, I absolutely make up obnoxious dialogue for the animals on screen, because that's the only corre...                    column          26 comments       Shelf Life - My Girlfriend is Shobitch   2019 Feb  5, 04:00 26 comments                 anime    Gabriella takes on a particularly stiff and seemingly already forgotten comedy about sexually clueless teens - plus all of this week's new anime DVD & Bluray releases! ―  Collecting things can be a strange process, especially when you look at it from an outsider's perspective. I recently tried to explain to someone why, when faced with a choice between two video games, I bought the one that cost more...                    column          20 comments       Shelf Life - Girls' Last Tour   2019 Jan 29, 02:00 20 comments                 anime    Paul discovers the world's most heartwarming apocalypse anime and breaks down all this week's new anime Blu-ray releases! ―  I can already sense my hopes of staying current with this season's simulcasts slipping away, but one series I've managed to keep up with is Run With the Wind. It's a nice little sports story with less of the typical teenage drama, and there's something wonderfully indulgent abo...                    column          9 comments       Shelf Life - Hells   2019 Jan 22, 03:15 9 comments                 anime    Paul takes a look at Madhouse's avant-garde movie about the underworld with a dub produced by Youtubers, plus a brand-new Shelf Obsessed submission and all this week's new anime releases! ―  By the time you read this, I'll probably be digging out from a foot or more of snow.

I'll be taking next week off, so you won't see a new column on the 24th (don't worry, nothing's coming out that week anyway). We'll be back with a ""year in review""...                    column          20 comments       Shelf Life - UQ Holder!   2018 Dec 11, 01:00 20 comments                 anime    Gabriella plunges deep into the lore of Ken Akamatsu for this Negima! spinoff action series, while Paul breaks down all this week's new anime releases! ―  I picked up the new Super Smash Bros. game this week, only to re-discover that I'm not very good at Smash games (and I never have been). Thankfully, the holidays should give me plenty of time to get better, or at least less comically awful. In the ...                    column          12 comments       Shelf Life - Scum's Wish   2018 Dec  4, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    James checks out this sexually charged teen melodrama with a surprisingly heartfelt edge, while Paul runs down all this week's new anime releases! ―  I saw Mirai last week, and it's an interesting film, particularly if you've seen any of Mamoru Hosoda's other movies. It's one of those stories that manages to be about children without being exclusively for children. If it's playing in your area, you m...                    column          11 comments       Shelf Life - Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!

It also means that some of this week's price links might be out of date (since I usually put these columns together on Saturday), so ...                    column          5 comments       Shelf Life - Terraformars Revenge   2018 Nov 20, 02:00 5 comments                 anime    Paul checks out the crude but effective sequel to a troubled anime series about fighting giant bugs on Mars, plus a breakdown of all this week's new anime releases! ―  Something about living in the Northeastern US has a tendency to warp one's mind in very particular ways.

Paul Jensen finds out. Plus, all this week's new anime releases! ―  A friend of mine is headed to Anime NYC next weekend.

It's a delightfully twisted little comedy, a fun send-up of both zombie and idol shows. I know that sounds insane, but it works better than it sounds. Welcome to Shelf Life.

I'm just hoping this doesn't make life more...                    column          40 comments       Shelf Life - Angel Cop   2018 Oct 15, 23:00 40 comments                 anime    This cyberpunk '80s OVA may be nostalgic for some fans, but it's hardly angelic.

PLUS: all of this week's new anime DVD & Bluray releases! ―  I rarely end up revisiting any of my old streaming review shows, if only because writing about a series every week forces you to get just about everything out of it on the first viewing.

Find out whether this 1986 classic deserves a spot on your shelf. ― I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?"" For the uninitiated, ...                    review          2 comments       I Can't Believe I Slept With You! GN 1   Mar 31, 00:00 2 comments                 manga    The manga starts off with questionable premise (a tenant agrees to exchange sex for roof over her head) but what you'll discover beneath that façade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society. ― It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise.

Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions?

The premise of a world occupied only by lesbians might sound silly on the surface, but 'Yuri Except for Me'  is a genuine attempt at creating a narrative arc for our main characters. ― I must say, the title and initial premise of this two-volume series did have me wondering just how much the story would fall back on gay panic or other stereotypes for the s...                    review                Soul Eater - The Perfect Edition GN 4-6   Mar 27, 00:00                 manga    The shonen action series enters Crona's arc, adding the most compelling drama in the series so far. ― Volume four of The Perfect Edition sees Soul Eater in pure, shonen action mode. It's the classic setup of an evil villain waiting at the end of a gauntlet of enemies, with each of our major characters getting a battle against an established baddie as they duke it out for the fate of the world.

How does Orochi hold up over 50 years after its original release? ― Orochi is a mysterious, clearly supernatural woman who serves as our guide through the two stories in this volume, a little bit like how Golden Age DC horror comics House of Mystery and The House of Secrets had Cain and Abel fill a similar function.

Original author Kalaku Yuki is very clear on that subject in their afterword, most likely out of an ab...                    game review          19 comments       Rune Factory 5   Mar 22, 18:00 19 comments                 games    Some technical issues aside, the latest installment in the village-making RPG brings it all together in the end.

Find out whether this 1986 classic deserves a spot on your shelf. ― I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?"" For the uninitiated, ...                    review          2 comments       I Can't Believe I Slept With You! GN 1   Mar 31, 00:00 2 comments                 manga    The manga starts off with questionable premise (a tenant agrees to exchange sex for roof over her head) but what you'll discover beneath that façade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society. ― It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise. When a story about a blossoming romance between two characters starts with one ...                           review                Lightning and Romance GN 1-2   Mar 30, 00:00                 manga    20-year-old Reo returns to high school to finish his education where he meets Sumire, and she's not about to let him dictate her feelings – especially not when he's kind of bad at hiding that he may like her, too ― If you've been reading Rin Mikimoto's previously translated works, you may have figured out that she has a thing for the age-gap romance – all of her other translated works but Kira-kun To...                    review          11 comments       Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai GN 1   Mar 29, 00:00 11 comments                 manga    See where young warrior Dai's adventure began...in the original manga series! ― Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions?

The premise of a world occupied only by lesbians might sound silly on the surface, but 'Yuri Except for Me'  is a genuine attempt at creating a narrative arc for our main characters. ― I must say, the title and initial premise of this two-volume series did have me wondering just how much the story would fall back on gay panic or other stereotypes for the s...                    review                Soul Eater - The Perfect Edition GN 4-6   Mar 27, 00:00                 manga    The shonen action series enters Crona's arc, adding the most compelling drama in the series so far. ― Volume four of The Perfect Edition sees Soul Eater in pure, shonen action mode.

How does Orochi hold up over 50 years after its original release? ― Orochi is a mysterious, clearly supernatural woman who serves as our guide through the two stories in this volume, a little bit like how Golden Age DC horror comics House of Mystery and The House of Secrets had Cain and Abel fill a similar function.

Original author Kalaku Yuki is very clear on that subject in their afterword, most likely out of an ab...                    game review          19 comments       Rune Factory 5   Mar 22, 18:00 19 comments                 games    Some technical issues aside, the latest installment in the village-making RPG brings it all together in the end.

It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                    review          12 comments       The History of Hentai Manga   Mar 17, 00:00 12 comments                 novels    Kimi Rito digs deep into the tropes of anime's salacious sister medium, from tracking down the hentai's early manga creators to going back even further to the shunga of the Edo period. ― If there is a form of media, no matter how maligned, there is a scholar or critic (or both) dedicated to examining it.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    review          8 comments       Selection Project   Jan 17, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    When it's not bogging itself down with tonal filler, Selection Project is filling the central character conflict of its reality-show story with some of the wildest plot twists I've encountered in a series like this recently. ― A crowded field like idol anime means a series needs to have its own particular identity to stand out, and Selection Project's approach seems to be to pitch itself as at least ...                    review          3 comments       Shikizakura Episodes 1-12   Jan 16, 01:00 3 comments                 anime    As far as what it's playing with in terms of influence and genre stylings, Shikizakura is tokusatsu as all heck. ― Tokusatsu has enjoyed a run of increased availability and visibility among English-speaking audiences, particularly those adjacent to anime fan circles, for a good several years now.

Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for.

Successfully combining the two into a compelling narrative, therefore, isn't necessarily an easy feat. But if that's what ...                    review          5 comments       I Think Our Son Is Gay GN 2   Feb 13, 01:00 5 comments                 manga    The series could be read as a wish for all parents to be like Tomoko, who, while not without her flaws, is ultimately doing the best she can while being patient and respecting her son—and loving him no matter what. ― One of the strongest points in favor of Okura's I Think Our Son is Gay is how the focus isn't solely on Hiroki's potential sexuality.

There is political unrest, players have seemingly disappeared, and it's heavily implied that if you die in the game then you die in real life.
