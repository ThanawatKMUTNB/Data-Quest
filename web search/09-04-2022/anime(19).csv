News NHK Report: Toei Animation Hack Was Ransomware Attack   posted on 2022-04-08 20:00 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Ransomware attack continues to affect production of delayed Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero film    NHK reported on Thursday that according to its sources at Toei Animation, the Toei Animation hack last month was a ransomware attack. NHK quoted a company source as saying, ""the impact on production is still continuing, and we are working hard to bring things back to normal.""    Toei Animation added it is still investigating the details of the attack, and stated it is not sure if it can completely restore what was lost in the attack. NHK added the ransomware attack is still affecting the production of the Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero film.    A ransomware attack is a form of malware attack that restricts access to data on a company's internal servers until a ransom is paid. Ransomware attacks disrupted meat production and gasoline distribution in the U.S. in 2021, and also hit Diamond Comic Distributors last year.    Toei Animation announced on March 11 that on March 6, an unauthorized third party accessed the company's network, which resulted in a shutdown of part of the company's systems. Toei Animation is currently investigating the matter. The hack affected the broadcast schedules for the One Piece, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai, Delicious Party Precure, and Digimon Ghost Game anime starting with the episodes slated to air on the weekend of March 12-13. All four shows will resume airing new episodes with the weekend of April 16-17.    Toei delayed Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, the second anime film in the Dragon Ball Super franchise, from its original April 22 opening in Japan. The film currently has no set debut date.

That thought occurred to me again and again while I was watching Colorful, the remarkable feature film produced by Sunrise in 2010,...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - SOS!

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F. Fujio's famous magical large blue cat character who's the star of over 2500 episodes of TV anime and 35 movies (not including short...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Guyver: Out of Control   2014 Jun 11, 03:43 18 comments                 anime    A mildly entertaining, but super-dated OAV incarnation of everyone's favorite superhero/grotesque monster/schoolboy. ―  Guyver: Out of Control Guyver: Out of Control was one of the earliest anime VHS releases in the US, and being an alternate retelling of the same story that the same company, US Renditions, would later release in dubbed form, was one of the first titles to confuse the hell out of peo...                    column          45 comments       Pile of Shame - Full Moon O Sagashite   2014 May 28, 00:00 45 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look back at the oddball Magical-Idol-Singer-With-Cancer Show from the early '00s. Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work. Others take it...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Nitaboh   2014 Apr 16, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    One of the few anime biographies, Nitaboh is surprisingly formulaic for being a true story. ―  Nitaboh, The Shamisen Master Last year, an old friend of mine asked me to help a non-profit group of radio producers come up with a Kickstarter video for a public radio project called ""Heavenly Sight,"" a multi-part audio documentary and web resource on blind African American blues and jazz musicians.

There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists.

Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English. I lay blame for that mostly in his ...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun   2014 Mar  5, 02:24 23 comments                 anime    Isao Takahata's troubled first feature is easily the best anime of the 1960s. ―  Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun It's the iron age, somewhere in Scandinavia, and a young boy warrior named Hols is just coming back home from a fierce battle with a pack of wolves. His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we.

The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody. Luckily by this time, humanity had a pretty decent settlement going on the moon, and once thin...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - After School Tinker Bell   2014 Jan  8, 01:00 23 comments                 anime    This week, an OAV based on a light novel series about a romantic couple that solves mysteries around their school. ―  After School Tinker Bell In the last few years there have been a ton of anime adapted from light novels: those small, pulpy, simply written and easy-to-read populist books that lie somewhere between young adult novels and manga. But light novels have been around for a very long time, ...                    column          12 comments       Pile of Shame - Handsome Girl   2013 Dec 25, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    Justin revisits an old one-shot OAV by the creator of Marmalade Boy... and is a little underwhelmed. ―  Handsome Girl When I was in high school, I loved the show Marmalade Boy. A lot. In fact, I wrote an article about it! A perfectly addictive confectionary of chaste teenaged yearning and romance, and undiluted raw crippling angst, I lost many an evening to the adventures of the lovelorn protagonists...                    column          11 comments       Pile of Shame - The Sensualist   2013 Dec 11, 02:10 11 comments                 anime    This week, a unique erotic historical fiction film that has completely slipped through the cracks. ―  The Sensualist (A.K.A. The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty. It felt like a piece of another person's life, so fo...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - Emblem Take 2   2013 Nov 27, 02:02 16 comments                 anime    This week, a rare yakuza time travel comedy. Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing. Unless you go looking for trouble in Tokyo, it's unlikely that a...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame: Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories   2013 Nov 13, 01:13 17 comments                 anime    Trying to watch this OAV like biting into a large wad of wet cotton: it's not offensive or unpleasant, but you want to end the experience as fast as humanly possible. ―  Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories If there's anything that anime lacks, it's real, adult love stories. We have enough yearning, angsty teen romance to sink a battleship, but realistic love stories about people whose frontal lobes are fir...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Wanna-Be's   2013 Oct 30, 00:01 23 comments     Did anyone say ""I want more women's wrestling anime?"" .... No? Didn't think so. ―  Wanna-Be's Lately there's been a lot of chatter about the girls' wrestling TV series, Wanna Be The Strongest In The World. Given that virtually none of the chatter is positive, I'm not really making plans to check out the show for myself. But hearing about a mediocre girls' wresting anime did jog my memory about anothe...                    column          5 comments       Pile of Shame - Grandeek: The Alternative   2013 Sep 18, 00:56 5 comments                 anime    An early digipaint OAV that has a lot of potential, but is so awkwardly made that the storytelling really suffers. ―  Grandeek: The Alternative When visiting Japan, one of my favorite things to do is explore the DVD sections of every Book Off location I can find.

Instead, it's just sort of lazy and crappy. ―  Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman One thing you can say about Butt Attack Girl Punisher Gautaman (and its sequel OAV, Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman R), you know pretty much exactly what you're getting: a cut-rate early-90s dirty comedy OAV about a girl that beats dudes down with her butt.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

That thought occurred to me again and again while I was watching Colorful, the remarkable feature film produced by Sunrise in 2010,...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - SOS!

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F. Fujio's famous magical large blue cat character who's the star of over 2500 episodes of TV anime and 35 movies (not including short...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Guyver: Out of Control   2014 Jun 11, 03:43 18 comments                 anime    A mildly entertaining, but super-dated OAV incarnation of everyone's favorite superhero/grotesque monster/schoolboy. ―  Guyver: Out of Control Guyver: Out of Control was one of the earliest anime VHS releases in the US, and being an alternate retelling of the same story that the same company, US Renditions, would later release in dubbed form, was one of the first titles to confuse the hell out of peo...                    column          45 comments       Pile of Shame - Full Moon O Sagashite   2014 May 28, 00:00 45 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look back at the oddball Magical-Idol-Singer-With-Cancer Show from the early '00s. Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work. Others take it...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Nitaboh   2014 Apr 16, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    One of the few anime biographies, Nitaboh is surprisingly formulaic for being a true story. ―  Nitaboh, The Shamisen Master Last year, an old friend of mine asked me to help a non-profit group of radio producers come up with a Kickstarter video for a public radio project called ""Heavenly Sight,"" a multi-part audio documentary and web resource on blind African American blues and jazz musicians.

There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English.

His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we.

The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody. Luckily by this time, humanity had a pretty decent settlement going on the moon, and once thin...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - After School Tinker Bell   2014 Jan  8, 01:00 23 comments                 anime    This week, an OAV based on a light novel series about a romantic couple that solves mysteries around their school. ―  After School Tinker Bell In the last few years there have been a ton of anime adapted from light novels: those small, pulpy, simply written and easy-to-read populist books that lie somewhere between young adult novels and manga. But light novels have been around for a very long time, ...                    column          12 comments       Pile of Shame - Handsome Girl   2013 Dec 25, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    Justin revisits an old one-shot OAV by the creator of Marmalade Boy... and is a little underwhelmed. ―  Handsome Girl When I was in high school, I loved the show Marmalade Boy. A lot. In fact, I wrote an article about it! A perfectly addictive confectionary of chaste teenaged yearning and romance, and undiluted raw crippling angst, I lost many an evening to the adventures of the lovelorn protagonists...                    column          11 comments       Pile of Shame - The Sensualist   2013 Dec 11, 02:10 11 comments                 anime    This week, a unique erotic historical fiction film that has completely slipped through the cracks. ―  The Sensualist (A.K.A. The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty.

Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing. Unless you go looking for trouble in Tokyo, it's unlikely that a...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame: Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories   2013 Nov 13, 01:13 17 comments                 anime    Trying to watch this OAV like biting into a large wad of wet cotton: it's not offensive or unpleasant, but you want to end the experience as fast as humanly possible. ―  Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories If there's anything that anime lacks, it's real, adult love stories. We have enough yearning, angsty teen romance to sink a battleship, but realistic love stories about people whose frontal lobes are fir...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Wanna-Be's   2013 Oct 30, 00:01 23 comments     Did anyone say ""I want more women's wrestling anime?"" ....

Given that virtually none of the chatter is positive, I'm not really making plans to check out the show for myself. But hearing about a mediocre girls' wresting anime did jog my memory about anothe...                    column          5 comments       Pile of Shame - Grandeek: The Alternative   2013 Sep 18, 00:56 5 comments                 anime    An early digipaint OAV that has a lot of potential, but is so awkwardly made that the storytelling really suffers. ―  Grandeek: The Alternative When visiting Japan, one of my favorite things to do is explore the DVD sections of every Book Off location I can find.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour.

Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often.

Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A.

There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English.

The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me.

Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase.

The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me.

Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA.

That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour.

Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows.

This Week in Anime Where Did Platinum End Go Wrong?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr  7th 2022           Platinum End plummeted to the bottom of the series ranking episode after episode. How did a show with a pedigree like ""from the creators of Death Note"" crash and burn so hard?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I'd like to begin with an apology. I know you were probably already prepared to bid your farewells to this show until the day unto dust we shall all return, but here I am exhuming its freshly worm-infested corpse for one final shellacking. All because I needed to know how bad Platinum End's second half had to be for the ANN community to consistently rank it lower than the softcore harem porn starring a guy who refused to have a harem.     Nick  Eh, it's fine. I've long accepted that the End is just the Beginning. And honestly it wouldn't feel right saying goodbye to this past season without flushing on this turd one last time.     If you need a refresher, we had the privilege of covering the first half at the end of last season, so you can catch up with that (https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-anime/2022-01-04/.181189). Or don't! Because nothing that happened there mattered, and this second part does a dogged job trying to do one worse.   Now now, we do technically get (have) to cover the conclusion of the show's first arc. Since last we covered it here Metropoliman's MGS boss rejects had all skedaddled and at last we were about to fight this asshole:      That's true. Let's all pour one out for God's strongest warrior.    I, for one, am shocked that a series with this particular pedigree would kill off a major antagonist midway through the series.   Hey they didn't just kill him off. They also gave us his wondrously stupid backstory! I'm sure everyone was wondering just what motivated such a complex and interesting villain.      Sure do hate it when I ""accidentally kill"" my imouto because she started talking about boys. Also I look like this the whole time. I'm the victim here.      It was definitely an accident! Why would he kill her when he so desperately wants to fuck her?        ...on second thought don't answer that question.   Here's to you and your normal one, Kanade.     Really the most horrifying part is that Metropoliman still has easily the most human motivation of any villain in this show.   That's the thing, right? And he actually has a discernable motivation, which puts him leagues beyond any of our protagonists. And, for as much shit as I have given and will give Platinum End, I'm really tickled by the fact that they made the evil siscon guy a libertarian. You know Kanade has memorized the age of consent in every country. It all fits together so well.         Also bold to make him a terminally online atheist too. When he's, you know, fighting to become God with power granted to him by an angel. And somehow that becomes a fucking running theme for this show's bad guys.     Look, just because there are glowing people with wings and halos and magic arrows doesn't NECESSARILY mean God exists. I mean, would a loving God have just stood there silently in the sky while one of his chosen children got turned into Swiss cheese?     Actually, considering everything we just mentioned about Kanade, yeah probably.   God I love how bad this show is with its own morals. Months on end of Mirai pitifully insisting that all life is precious and we should never kill anyone because that will make us all unhappy and then we get a minutes-long sequence of a dude being turned into salsa, complete with x-ray shots of the bullets tearing through his meat. Who the fuck needs ideological consistency?     I don't! I wish we got more of that! At least it isn't boring, and it taps into the ultraviolent tasteless excess that helped make Death Note so damn entertaining. Platinum End's direction still sadly doesn't hold a candle to Tetsuro Araki's over-the-top eye, but indulgences like Kanade's complete disintegration at least scratch at the door.   Unfortunately that's also the last hurrah for any slightly interesting creative decisions in this show. After that the primary director, Hideya Takahashi, promptly skipped town to work on the new Urusei Yatsura show and we were left with the visual stylings of the guy who made some of the least remembered Ghost in the Shell entries. You can tell this transition happens when everything inexplicably turns grey.     The debate settings also get more and more drab. At one point half the cast is cooped up in a chrome underground bunker.    Also this series fucking loves holding confrontations in empty sports stadiums.     I'm not gonna blow smoke up anyone's ass and say the first half of this show was visually inventive or anything. But it really is noticeable how immediate the downturn in visuals happens, and how it turns an already dull story into an endurance match.   We do definitely have to lay blame on the story too, which somehow takes the first half's philosophical stiffness and regresses into a full rigor mortis of 101-level diatribes about ontology and free will.   No need to be so wordy with this. This show becomes a Reddit argument. And not even the funny kind you see screenshots of on Twitter.      I do kinda adore this kid, though that may just be me sympathizing with any character who wants out of this story.    But you're right, it's a Reddit thread of an anime. And I'll tell you who's not winning any arguments: our hero.     Oh you're not impressed by Mirai's plan of ""let the suicidal 12-year-old become God because I don't want to?""      That's not even his plan. He's just going along with Nasse's suggestion. Mirai lacks enough of a conviction about anything to have ""plans."" He's a cipher devoid of thought or personality, beyond a vague sense that he should disagree with certain people because they happen to be the current antagonist.   Doesn't help that the person he's most attached to is also a complete nonentity. I've seen some terrible anime romances but Mirai x Saki may be the perfect blackhole of anti-chemistry.    It's amazing that for how much of their shared dialogue is just saying how being with the other makes them happiest of all, we almost never see them smile or laugh or even look mildly unbothered to be next to one another.      A romance for the ages. Positively smoldering.   Just. Good lord.    I swear I didn't edit that. That's just how this show is.   I was HOWLING at that part. My dude has a Pentium II processor up there. It's the best he can do. I also really love this still from the beginning of that scene, because it's one of the most nonfunctional shots I've ever seen. Impossible to distinguish, nothing being accomplished, featuring two characters who may as well fade into the background.     Real fucked up part is this is still probably the least awful romance Ohba's ever created. If nothing else Mirai's never gone on a rant about how ambitious women are stupid for not knowing their place, and they don't arbitrarily decide to never talk to each other until they're both famous celebrities.   When you put it like that, I guess I can't be too harsh on them. Saki also makes it out better than any other woman on the show, possibly due to the same fact that Ohba forgot to give her a personality. We have a convenient counterexample with Yuri, who's basically just a greedy one-dimensional butt of jokes.      Hey, at least the anime cut the part where we find out she's also homophobic! So she gets to just be a shallow influencer character you'd see in a Ben Garrison comic.      It's funny, cutting that specific rant out and leaving us with just the story's casual misogyny only ends up making Yuri one of the most likeable characters on the show. Certainly the most relatable.     Ironically she has probably the best plan of any of the potential God Candidates on paper. Get her some pamphlets on UBI and we might just have a happy ending after all.      Come on, Nick, we all know that there's never been a single example in all of history where providing people with additional support and welfare made their lives demonstrably and immediately better. Let's hear what an actual smart person has to say about all this.      ...still better than Mirai's idea.      Dude gets handed an essay assignment and scribbles ""I dunno"" before handing it back to the teacher. I respect the honesty. He still gets an F.   I guess we finally gotta talk about the skidmark that is this show's final antagonist.     Yoneda really drags the whole show down into the mud. And it has less to do with the dude's ideas or ethics and a lot to do with the fact that he just will not shut the fuck up.   It's honestly worse in the manga. At least here you get to listen to Kenjiro Tsuda talk about total bullshit that means less than nothing. In print all you get is endless panel-sized word bubbles saying even dumber stuff.   I didn't even think about that! Absolutely miserable. He's also, for me, an anime personification of an uncomfortable reminder of my collegiate militant atheist phase. Like, yeah dude, I get it. I read Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris too. You're not special.     Doesn't help that he's supposed to be wrong but the characters he's arguing with are on the level of 3rd graders at best.      Turns out it's easy to win a debate when you just pull numbers out of your ass and nobody there has enough of a brain to question them.     Source: dude just trust me.   Also I hope you're paying attention to that totally real statistic, because it's the ONLY THING in the show that spurs Mirai to actually hold something resembling determination.    There's always going to be a struggle with shows like these, that want to have world-scale stakes but can't literally hold the world hostage, when it comes to depicting the larger population. But even by those standards this fuckin sucks:      And beyond the cringe misanthropy of that, you'd think a story like this, however poorly conceived or written, would be chomping at the bit to finally, in its climactic arc, address some fundamental questions about the concepts of God and religion. How have they helped mankind? How have they hurt mankind? Is it a net good or evil? Does it even matter, in the long run? But no, Platinum End just flattens the debate to ""7 million people will kill themselves if nobody becomes God."" That's the only thing taken in consideration going into the climax.   And even that barely matters because the actual stakes of the climax are if Mirai will sacrifice himself for Saki because every person in this show is stupid enough to walk into an obvious hostage situation.      It's okay. Mirai finally grew some gonads so he's definitely going to put the needs of the greater goo—    This kid sucks so bad.   He literally has to be bailed out by The Angel of Bimbofication here.         Which is a big no-no, so God personally punishes Nasse by demoting her a couple ranks.    A little late for the series to start exploring these kinds of consequences for its supernatural cast members, but at least that raises the stakes a bi—    Oh COME ON   I genuinely don't know what the fuck the point of that was? Yoneda says it was all according to keikaku, presumably so that Mirai would lose his murder arrow with the demotion, but he was already about to kill the guy so like...what was he trying to accomplish?     It's just one more grain of sand in a desert of irrelevance. Platinum End, front to back, is utterly bereft of anything that matters, and given the way the series ends, I can only conclude that this is intentional.   That's more confidence than I have in what I think this ending was trying for. All I can really garner is ""making the literal child whose only desire is to off himself God is not a great long-term plan.""     I mean I wouldn't go so far as to use the word ""trying,"" because everything in the last episode is insultingly lazy. It's one big ""gotcha"" for every single character and, by extension, the audience. Posturing as deep but as flimsy as a paper tiger.    Also God kills himself lol.   Ah come on, there's some really good philosophizing in here somewhere. We just have to look!     I guess when you're an effectively omnipotent being you have nothing better to do than come up with weird metaphors about fruit.     But listen. Everyone talks about the self-deicide because it's the only interesting thing about this show. We need to at least address how this ending is also total dogshit resolution for what few characters made it to the last episode. Like how Mirai and Saki manage to get MARRIED and still look dead inside doing it.      Or you've got THIS. Which honestly would be cute in a completely different series that treated both of these characters better. And that's how much I have to stretch to say something nice here.     They're the perfect couple really. She's too shallow to demand any actual emotional connection from him, but also too stupid to recognize he's constantly insulting her. It's a match made in hell! Or I guess technically a match made in the rapture.         So here's the thrust of the ending if you don't want to watch it yourself (and you don't). God killing himself causes all life on Earth to disappear, because God created life. However, God himself was created by more advanced beings, who have seeded various Gods on planets like Earth to see if they can grow a creature capable of killing them. Because those advanced beings are immortal, and they also don't know who created them, and it sucks, and they want to die. Everything sucks. Yoneda was wrong. Mirai was wrong. Nothing matters. Fuck you.     Fuck Yoneda in particular. Even in the last fleeting moments before his existence ceases across all planes, he still has to come up with a reason why he's not wrong.        Sorry dude, but not even your shampoo bottles are gonna buy that one.   It's the final rusty nail in the show's coffin. It's the perfect emblem of its turgid nihilism. And it sorta helps a lot make sense in retrospect: its hero had no convictions, because Platinum End had none. All it had was contempt for itself and for its audience. It is, admittedly, a little fascinating in that regard, but not nearly enough to justify its own vacuous existence.   It's a show that seemed to either have no idea what it was doing, or actively hated what it was doing, sometimes both at once. It throws high concepts out with neither care nor curiosity, and in the process it also shits on incredibly personal topics without even noticing. It's a big, steaming pile of failure that stayed in the corner until it calcified.   Yeah, ultimately, I can't pretend to know what was going on in its creators' minds, but from its opening death game dirge all the way to its intellectual forfeit of an ending, it just seems to resent its own existence. What a bizarre way to be.   I'm you're interesting in something sort of similar that actually has an idea of what it's doing and isn't boring as piss, just go watch DEVILMAN crybaby and have a better time. Or re-watch Death Note. Or file your taxes.   So Steve, since you're probably the only person at this intersection, which was the worse ""End"" show: this, or World’s End Harem?

This Week in Anime Where Did Platinum End Go Wrong?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr  7th 2022           Platinum End plummeted to the bottom of the series ranking episode after episode. How did a show with a pedigree like ""from the creators of Death Note"" crash and burn so hard?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I'd like to begin with an apology. I know you were probably already prepared to bid your farewells to this show until the day unto dust we shall all return, but here I am exhuming its freshly worm-infested corpse for one final shellacking. All because I needed to know how bad Platinum End's second half had to be for the ANN community to consistently rank it lower than the softcore harem porn starring a guy who refused to have a harem.     Nick  Eh, it's fine. I've long accepted that the End is just the Beginning. And honestly it wouldn't feel right saying goodbye to this past season without flushing on this turd one last time.     If you need a refresher, we had the privilege of covering the first half at the end of last season, so you can catch up with that (https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-anime/2022-01-04/.181189). Or don't! Because nothing that happened there mattered, and this second part does a dogged job trying to do one worse.   Now now, we do technically get (have) to cover the conclusion of the show's first arc. Since last we covered it here Metropoliman's MGS boss rejects had all skedaddled and at last we were about to fight this asshole:      That's true. Let's all pour one out for God's strongest warrior.    I, for one, am shocked that a series with this particular pedigree would kill off a major antagonist midway through the series.   Hey they didn't just kill him off. They also gave us his wondrously stupid backstory! I'm sure everyone was wondering just what motivated such a complex and interesting villain.      Sure do hate it when I ""accidentally kill"" my imouto because she started talking about boys. Also I look like this the whole time. I'm the victim here.      It was definitely an accident! Why would he kill her when he so desperately wants to fuck her?        ...on second thought don't answer that question.   Here's to you and your normal one, Kanade.     Really the most horrifying part is that Metropoliman still has easily the most human motivation of any villain in this show.   That's the thing, right? And he actually has a discernable motivation, which puts him leagues beyond any of our protagonists. And, for as much shit as I have given and will give Platinum End, I'm really tickled by the fact that they made the evil siscon guy a libertarian. You know Kanade has memorized the age of consent in every country. It all fits together so well.         Also bold to make him a terminally online atheist too. When he's, you know, fighting to become God with power granted to him by an angel. And somehow that becomes a fucking running theme for this show's bad guys.     Look, just because there are glowing people with wings and halos and magic arrows doesn't NECESSARILY mean God exists. I mean, would a loving God have just stood there silently in the sky while one of his chosen children got turned into Swiss cheese?     Actually, considering everything we just mentioned about Kanade, yeah probably.   God I love how bad this show is with its own morals. Months on end of Mirai pitifully insisting that all life is precious and we should never kill anyone because that will make us all unhappy and then we get a minutes-long sequence of a dude being turned into salsa, complete with x-ray shots of the bullets tearing through his meat. Who the fuck needs ideological consistency?     I don't! I wish we got more of that! At least it isn't boring, and it taps into the ultraviolent tasteless excess that helped make Death Note so damn entertaining. Platinum End's direction still sadly doesn't hold a candle to Tetsuro Araki's over-the-top eye, but indulgences like Kanade's complete disintegration at least scratch at the door.   Unfortunately that's also the last hurrah for any slightly interesting creative decisions in this show. After that the primary director, Hideya Takahashi, promptly skipped town to work on the new Urusei Yatsura show and we were left with the visual stylings of the guy who made some of the least remembered Ghost in the Shell entries. You can tell this transition happens when everything inexplicably turns grey.     The debate settings also get more and more drab. At one point half the cast is cooped up in a chrome underground bunker.    Also this series fucking loves holding confrontations in empty sports stadiums.     I'm not gonna blow smoke up anyone's ass and say the first half of this show was visually inventive or anything. But it really is noticeable how immediate the downturn in visuals happens, and how it turns an already dull story into an endurance match.   We do definitely have to lay blame on the story too, which somehow takes the first half's philosophical stiffness and regresses into a full rigor mortis of 101-level diatribes about ontology and free will.   No need to be so wordy with this. This show becomes a Reddit argument. And not even the funny kind you see screenshots of on Twitter.      I do kinda adore this kid, though that may just be me sympathizing with any character who wants out of this story.    But you're right, it's a Reddit thread of an anime. And I'll tell you who's not winning any arguments: our hero.     Oh you're not impressed by Mirai's plan of ""let the suicidal 12-year-old become God because I don't want to?""      That's not even his plan. He's just going along with Nasse's suggestion. Mirai lacks enough of a conviction about anything to have ""plans."" He's a cipher devoid of thought or personality, beyond a vague sense that he should disagree with certain people because they happen to be the current antagonist.   Doesn't help that the person he's most attached to is also a complete nonentity. I've seen some terrible anime romances but Mirai x Saki may be the perfect blackhole of anti-chemistry.    It's amazing that for how much of their shared dialogue is just saying how being with the other makes them happiest of all, we almost never see them smile or laugh or even look mildly unbothered to be next to one another.      A romance for the ages. Positively smoldering.   Just. Good lord.    I swear I didn't edit that. That's just how this show is.   I was HOWLING at that part. My dude has a Pentium II processor up there. It's the best he can do. I also really love this still from the beginning of that scene, because it's one of the most nonfunctional shots I've ever seen. Impossible to distinguish, nothing being accomplished, featuring two characters who may as well fade into the background.     Real fucked up part is this is still probably the least awful romance Ohba's ever created. If nothing else Mirai's never gone on a rant about how ambitious women are stupid for not knowing their place, and they don't arbitrarily decide to never talk to each other until they're both famous celebrities.   When you put it like that, I guess I can't be too harsh on them. Saki also makes it out better than any other woman on the show, possibly due to the same fact that Ohba forgot to give her a personality. We have a convenient counterexample with Yuri, who's basically just a greedy one-dimensional butt of jokes.      Hey, at least the anime cut the part where we find out she's also homophobic! So she gets to just be a shallow influencer character you'd see in a Ben Garrison comic.      It's funny, cutting that specific rant out and leaving us with just the story's casual misogyny only ends up making Yuri one of the most likeable characters on the show. Certainly the most relatable.     Ironically she has probably the best plan of any of the potential God Candidates on paper. Get her some pamphlets on UBI and we might just have a happy ending after all.      Come on, Nick, we all know that there's never been a single example in all of history where providing people with additional support and welfare made their lives demonstrably and immediately better. Let's hear what an actual smart person has to say about all this.      ...still better than Mirai's idea.      Dude gets handed an essay assignment and scribbles ""I dunno"" before handing it back to the teacher. I respect the honesty. He still gets an F.   I guess we finally gotta talk about the skidmark that is this show's final antagonist.     Yoneda really drags the whole show down into the mud. And it has less to do with the dude's ideas or ethics and a lot to do with the fact that he just will not shut the fuck up.   It's honestly worse in the manga. At least here you get to listen to Kenjiro Tsuda talk about total bullshit that means less than nothing. In print all you get is endless panel-sized word bubbles saying even dumber stuff.   I didn't even think about that! Absolutely miserable. He's also, for me, an anime personification of an uncomfortable reminder of my collegiate militant atheist phase. Like, yeah dude, I get it. I read Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris too. You're not special.     Doesn't help that he's supposed to be wrong but the characters he's arguing with are on the level of 3rd graders at best.      Turns out it's easy to win a debate when you just pull numbers out of your ass and nobody there has enough of a brain to question them.     Source: dude just trust me.   Also I hope you're paying attention to that totally real statistic, because it's the ONLY THING in the show that spurs Mirai to actually hold something resembling determination.    There's always going to be a struggle with shows like these, that want to have world-scale stakes but can't literally hold the world hostage, when it comes to depicting the larger population. But even by those standards this fuckin sucks:      And beyond the cringe misanthropy of that, you'd think a story like this, however poorly conceived or written, would be chomping at the bit to finally, in its climactic arc, address some fundamental questions about the concepts of God and religion. How have they helped mankind? How have they hurt mankind? Is it a net good or evil? Does it even matter, in the long run? But no, Platinum End just flattens the debate to ""7 million people will kill themselves if nobody becomes God."" That's the only thing taken in consideration going into the climax.   And even that barely matters because the actual stakes of the climax are if Mirai will sacrifice himself for Saki because every person in this show is stupid enough to walk into an obvious hostage situation.      It's okay. Mirai finally grew some gonads so he's definitely going to put the needs of the greater goo—    This kid sucks so bad.   He literally has to be bailed out by The Angel of Bimbofication here.         Which is a big no-no, so God personally punishes Nasse by demoting her a couple ranks.    A little late for the series to start exploring these kinds of consequences for its supernatural cast members, but at least that raises the stakes a bi—    Oh COME ON   I genuinely don't know what the fuck the point of that was? Yoneda says it was all according to keikaku, presumably so that Mirai would lose his murder arrow with the demotion, but he was already about to kill the guy so like...what was he trying to accomplish?     It's just one more grain of sand in a desert of irrelevance. Platinum End, front to back, is utterly bereft of anything that matters, and given the way the series ends, I can only conclude that this is intentional.   That's more confidence than I have in what I think this ending was trying for. All I can really garner is ""making the literal child whose only desire is to off himself God is not a great long-term plan.""     I mean I wouldn't go so far as to use the word ""trying,"" because everything in the last episode is insultingly lazy. It's one big ""gotcha"" for every single character and, by extension, the audience. Posturing as deep but as flimsy as a paper tiger.    Also God kills himself lol.   Ah come on, there's some really good philosophizing in here somewhere. We just have to look!     I guess when you're an effectively omnipotent being you have nothing better to do than come up with weird metaphors about fruit.     But listen. Everyone talks about the self-deicide because it's the only interesting thing about this show. We need to at least address how this ending is also total dogshit resolution for what few characters made it to the last episode. Like how Mirai and Saki manage to get MARRIED and still look dead inside doing it.      Or you've got THIS. Which honestly would be cute in a completely different series that treated both of these characters better. And that's how much I have to stretch to say something nice here.     They're the perfect couple really. She's too shallow to demand any actual emotional connection from him, but also too stupid to recognize he's constantly insulting her. It's a match made in hell! Or I guess technically a match made in the rapture.         So here's the thrust of the ending if you don't want to watch it yourself (and you don't). God killing himself causes all life on Earth to disappear, because God created life. However, God himself was created by more advanced beings, who have seeded various Gods on planets like Earth to see if they can grow a creature capable of killing them. Because those advanced beings are immortal, and they also don't know who created them, and it sucks, and they want to die. Everything sucks. Yoneda was wrong. Mirai was wrong. Nothing matters. Fuck you.     Fuck Yoneda in particular. Even in the last fleeting moments before his existence ceases across all planes, he still has to come up with a reason why he's not wrong.        Sorry dude, but not even your shampoo bottles are gonna buy that one.   It's the final rusty nail in the show's coffin. It's the perfect emblem of its turgid nihilism. And it sorta helps a lot make sense in retrospect: its hero had no convictions, because Platinum End had none. All it had was contempt for itself and for its audience. It is, admittedly, a little fascinating in that regard, but not nearly enough to justify its own vacuous existence.   It's a show that seemed to either have no idea what it was doing, or actively hated what it was doing, sometimes both at once. It throws high concepts out with neither care nor curiosity, and in the process it also shits on incredibly personal topics without even noticing. It's a big, steaming pile of failure that stayed in the corner until it calcified.   Yeah, ultimately, I can't pretend to know what was going on in its creators' minds, but from its opening death game dirge all the way to its intellectual forfeit of an ending, it just seems to resent its own existence. What a bizarre way to be.   I'm you're interesting in something sort of similar that actually has an idea of what it's doing and isn't boring as piss, just go watch DEVILMAN crybaby and have a better time. Or re-watch Death Note. Or file your taxes.   So Steve, since you're probably the only person at this intersection, which was the worse ""End"" show: this, or World’s End Harem?

This Week in Anime Where Did Platinum End Go Wrong?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr  7th 2022           Platinum End plummeted to the bottom of the series ranking episode after episode. How did a show with a pedigree like ""from the creators of Death Note"" crash and burn so hard?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I'd like to begin with an apology. I know you were probably already prepared to bid your farewells to this show until the day unto dust we shall all return, but here I am exhuming its freshly worm-infested corpse for one final shellacking. All because I needed to know how bad Platinum End's second half had to be for the ANN community to consistently rank it lower than the softcore harem porn starring a guy who refused to have a harem.     Nick  Eh, it's fine. I've long accepted that the End is just the Beginning. And honestly it wouldn't feel right saying goodbye to this past season without flushing on this turd one last time.     If you need a refresher, we had the privilege of covering the first half at the end of last season, so you can catch up with that (https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-anime/2022-01-04/.181189). Or don't! Because nothing that happened there mattered, and this second part does a dogged job trying to do one worse.   Now now, we do technically get (have) to cover the conclusion of the show's first arc. Since last we covered it here Metropoliman's MGS boss rejects had all skedaddled and at last we were about to fight this asshole:      That's true. Let's all pour one out for God's strongest warrior.    I, for one, am shocked that a series with this particular pedigree would kill off a major antagonist midway through the series.   Hey they didn't just kill him off. They also gave us his wondrously stupid backstory! I'm sure everyone was wondering just what motivated such a complex and interesting villain.      Sure do hate it when I ""accidentally kill"" my imouto because she started talking about boys. Also I look like this the whole time. I'm the victim here.      It was definitely an accident! Why would he kill her when he so desperately wants to fuck her?        ...on second thought don't answer that question.   Here's to you and your normal one, Kanade.     Really the most horrifying part is that Metropoliman still has easily the most human motivation of any villain in this show.   That's the thing, right? And he actually has a discernable motivation, which puts him leagues beyond any of our protagonists. And, for as much shit as I have given and will give Platinum End, I'm really tickled by the fact that they made the evil siscon guy a libertarian. You know Kanade has memorized the age of consent in every country. It all fits together so well.         Also bold to make him a terminally online atheist too. When he's, you know, fighting to become God with power granted to him by an angel. And somehow that becomes a fucking running theme for this show's bad guys.     Look, just because there are glowing people with wings and halos and magic arrows doesn't NECESSARILY mean God exists. I mean, would a loving God have just stood there silently in the sky while one of his chosen children got turned into Swiss cheese?     Actually, considering everything we just mentioned about Kanade, yeah probably.   God I love how bad this show is with its own morals. Months on end of Mirai pitifully insisting that all life is precious and we should never kill anyone because that will make us all unhappy and then we get a minutes-long sequence of a dude being turned into salsa, complete with x-ray shots of the bullets tearing through his meat. Who the fuck needs ideological consistency?     I don't! I wish we got more of that! At least it isn't boring, and it taps into the ultraviolent tasteless excess that helped make Death Note so damn entertaining. Platinum End's direction still sadly doesn't hold a candle to Tetsuro Araki's over-the-top eye, but indulgences like Kanade's complete disintegration at least scratch at the door.   Unfortunately that's also the last hurrah for any slightly interesting creative decisions in this show. After that the primary director, Hideya Takahashi, promptly skipped town to work on the new Urusei Yatsura show and we were left with the visual stylings of the guy who made some of the least remembered Ghost in the Shell entries. You can tell this transition happens when everything inexplicably turns grey.     The debate settings also get more and more drab. At one point half the cast is cooped up in a chrome underground bunker.    Also this series fucking loves holding confrontations in empty sports stadiums.     I'm not gonna blow smoke up anyone's ass and say the first half of this show was visually inventive or anything. But it really is noticeable how immediate the downturn in visuals happens, and how it turns an already dull story into an endurance match.   We do definitely have to lay blame on the story too, which somehow takes the first half's philosophical stiffness and regresses into a full rigor mortis of 101-level diatribes about ontology and free will.   No need to be so wordy with this. This show becomes a Reddit argument. And not even the funny kind you see screenshots of on Twitter.      I do kinda adore this kid, though that may just be me sympathizing with any character who wants out of this story.    But you're right, it's a Reddit thread of an anime. And I'll tell you who's not winning any arguments: our hero.     Oh you're not impressed by Mirai's plan of ""let the suicidal 12-year-old become God because I don't want to?""      That's not even his plan. He's just going along with Nasse's suggestion. Mirai lacks enough of a conviction about anything to have ""plans."" He's a cipher devoid of thought or personality, beyond a vague sense that he should disagree with certain people because they happen to be the current antagonist.   Doesn't help that the person he's most attached to is also a complete nonentity. I've seen some terrible anime romances but Mirai x Saki may be the perfect blackhole of anti-chemistry.    It's amazing that for how much of their shared dialogue is just saying how being with the other makes them happiest of all, we almost never see them smile or laugh or even look mildly unbothered to be next to one another.      A romance for the ages. Positively smoldering.   Just. Good lord.    I swear I didn't edit that. That's just how this show is.   I was HOWLING at that part. My dude has a Pentium II processor up there. It's the best he can do. I also really love this still from the beginning of that scene, because it's one of the most nonfunctional shots I've ever seen. Impossible to distinguish, nothing being accomplished, featuring two characters who may as well fade into the background.     Real fucked up part is this is still probably the least awful romance Ohba's ever created. If nothing else Mirai's never gone on a rant about how ambitious women are stupid for not knowing their place, and they don't arbitrarily decide to never talk to each other until they're both famous celebrities.   When you put it like that, I guess I can't be too harsh on them. Saki also makes it out better than any other woman on the show, possibly due to the same fact that Ohba forgot to give her a personality. We have a convenient counterexample with Yuri, who's basically just a greedy one-dimensional butt of jokes.      Hey, at least the anime cut the part where we find out she's also homophobic! So she gets to just be a shallow influencer character you'd see in a Ben Garrison comic.      It's funny, cutting that specific rant out and leaving us with just the story's casual misogyny only ends up making Yuri one of the most likeable characters on the show. Certainly the most relatable.     Ironically she has probably the best plan of any of the potential God Candidates on paper. Get her some pamphlets on UBI and we might just have a happy ending after all.      Come on, Nick, we all know that there's never been a single example in all of history where providing people with additional support and welfare made their lives demonstrably and immediately better. Let's hear what an actual smart person has to say about all this.      ...still better than Mirai's idea.      Dude gets handed an essay assignment and scribbles ""I dunno"" before handing it back to the teacher. I respect the honesty. He still gets an F.   I guess we finally gotta talk about the skidmark that is this show's final antagonist.     Yoneda really drags the whole show down into the mud. And it has less to do with the dude's ideas or ethics and a lot to do with the fact that he just will not shut the fuck up.   It's honestly worse in the manga. At least here you get to listen to Kenjiro Tsuda talk about total bullshit that means less than nothing. In print all you get is endless panel-sized word bubbles saying even dumber stuff.   I didn't even think about that! Absolutely miserable. He's also, for me, an anime personification of an uncomfortable reminder of my collegiate militant atheist phase. Like, yeah dude, I get it. I read Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris too. You're not special.     Doesn't help that he's supposed to be wrong but the characters he's arguing with are on the level of 3rd graders at best.      Turns out it's easy to win a debate when you just pull numbers out of your ass and nobody there has enough of a brain to question them.     Source: dude just trust me.   Also I hope you're paying attention to that totally real statistic, because it's the ONLY THING in the show that spurs Mirai to actually hold something resembling determination.    There's always going to be a struggle with shows like these, that want to have world-scale stakes but can't literally hold the world hostage, when it comes to depicting the larger population. But even by those standards this fuckin sucks:      And beyond the cringe misanthropy of that, you'd think a story like this, however poorly conceived or written, would be chomping at the bit to finally, in its climactic arc, address some fundamental questions about the concepts of God and religion. How have they helped mankind? How have they hurt mankind? Is it a net good or evil? Does it even matter, in the long run? But no, Platinum End just flattens the debate to ""7 million people will kill themselves if nobody becomes God."" That's the only thing taken in consideration going into the climax.   And even that barely matters because the actual stakes of the climax are if Mirai will sacrifice himself for Saki because every person in this show is stupid enough to walk into an obvious hostage situation.      It's okay. Mirai finally grew some gonads so he's definitely going to put the needs of the greater goo—    This kid sucks so bad.   He literally has to be bailed out by The Angel of Bimbofication here.         Which is a big no-no, so God personally punishes Nasse by demoting her a couple ranks.    A little late for the series to start exploring these kinds of consequences for its supernatural cast members, but at least that raises the stakes a bi—    Oh COME ON   I genuinely don't know what the fuck the point of that was? Yoneda says it was all according to keikaku, presumably so that Mirai would lose his murder arrow with the demotion, but he was already about to kill the guy so like...what was he trying to accomplish?     It's just one more grain of sand in a desert of irrelevance. Platinum End, front to back, is utterly bereft of anything that matters, and given the way the series ends, I can only conclude that this is intentional.   That's more confidence than I have in what I think this ending was trying for. All I can really garner is ""making the literal child whose only desire is to off himself God is not a great long-term plan.""     I mean I wouldn't go so far as to use the word ""trying,"" because everything in the last episode is insultingly lazy. It's one big ""gotcha"" for every single character and, by extension, the audience. Posturing as deep but as flimsy as a paper tiger.    Also God kills himself lol.   Ah come on, there's some really good philosophizing in here somewhere. We just have to look!     I guess when you're an effectively omnipotent being you have nothing better to do than come up with weird metaphors about fruit.     But listen. Everyone talks about the self-deicide because it's the only interesting thing about this show. We need to at least address how this ending is also total dogshit resolution for what few characters made it to the last episode. Like how Mirai and Saki manage to get MARRIED and still look dead inside doing it.      Or you've got THIS. Which honestly would be cute in a completely different series that treated both of these characters better. And that's how much I have to stretch to say something nice here.     They're the perfect couple really. She's too shallow to demand any actual emotional connection from him, but also too stupid to recognize he's constantly insulting her. It's a match made in hell! Or I guess technically a match made in the rapture.         So here's the thrust of the ending if you don't want to watch it yourself (and you don't). God killing himself causes all life on Earth to disappear, because God created life. However, God himself was created by more advanced beings, who have seeded various Gods on planets like Earth to see if they can grow a creature capable of killing them. Because those advanced beings are immortal, and they also don't know who created them, and it sucks, and they want to die. Everything sucks. Yoneda was wrong. Mirai was wrong. Nothing matters. Fuck you.     Fuck Yoneda in particular. Even in the last fleeting moments before his existence ceases across all planes, he still has to come up with a reason why he's not wrong.        Sorry dude, but not even your shampoo bottles are gonna buy that one.   It's the final rusty nail in the show's coffin. It's the perfect emblem of its turgid nihilism. And it sorta helps a lot make sense in retrospect: its hero had no convictions, because Platinum End had none. All it had was contempt for itself and for its audience. It is, admittedly, a little fascinating in that regard, but not nearly enough to justify its own vacuous existence.   It's a show that seemed to either have no idea what it was doing, or actively hated what it was doing, sometimes both at once. It throws high concepts out with neither care nor curiosity, and in the process it also shits on incredibly personal topics without even noticing. It's a big, steaming pile of failure that stayed in the corner until it calcified.   Yeah, ultimately, I can't pretend to know what was going on in its creators' minds, but from its opening death game dirge all the way to its intellectual forfeit of an ending, it just seems to resent its own existence. What a bizarre way to be.   I'm you're interesting in something sort of similar that actually has an idea of what it's doing and isn't boring as piss, just go watch DEVILMAN crybaby and have a better time. Or re-watch Death Note. Or file your taxes.   So Steve, since you're probably the only person at this intersection, which was the worse ""End"" show: this, or World’s End Harem?

Come on, Nick, we all know that there's never been a single example in all of history where providing people with additional support and welfare made their lives demonstrably and immediately better. Let's hear what an actual smart person has to say about all this.      ...still better than Mirai's idea.      Dude gets handed an essay assignment and scribbles ""I dunno"" before handing it back to the teacher. I respect the honesty. He still gets an F.   I guess we finally gotta talk about the skidmark that is this show's final antagonist.     Yoneda really drags the whole show down into the mud. And it has less to do with the dude's ideas or ethics and a lot to do with the fact that he just will not shut the fuck up.   It's honestly worse in the manga. At least here you get to listen to Kenjiro Tsuda talk about total bullshit that means less than nothing. In print all you get is endless panel-sized word bubbles saying even dumber stuff.   I didn't even think about that! Absolutely miserable. He's also, for me, an anime personification of an uncomfortable reminder of my collegiate militant atheist phase. Like, yeah dude, I get it. I read Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris too. You're not special.     Doesn't help that he's supposed to be wrong but the characters he's arguing with are on the level of 3rd graders at best.      Turns out it's easy to win a debate when you just pull numbers out of your ass and nobody there has enough of a brain to question them.     Source: dude just trust me.   Also I hope you're paying attention to that totally real statistic, because it's the ONLY THING in the show that spurs Mirai to actually hold something resembling determination.    There's always going to be a struggle with shows like these, that want to have world-scale stakes but can't literally hold the world hostage, when it comes to depicting the larger population. But even by those standards this fuckin sucks:      And beyond the cringe misanthropy of that, you'd think a story like this, however poorly conceived or written, would be chomping at the bit to finally, in its climactic arc, address some fundamental questions about the concepts of God and religion. How have they helped mankind? How have they hurt mankind? Is it a net good or evil? Does it even matter, in the long run? But no, Platinum End just flattens the debate to ""7 million people will kill themselves if nobody becomes God."" That's the only thing taken in consideration going into the climax.   And even that barely matters because the actual stakes of the climax are if Mirai will sacrifice himself for Saki because every person in this show is stupid enough to walk into an obvious hostage situation.      It's okay. Mirai finally grew some gonads so he's definitely going to put the needs of the greater goo—    This kid sucks so bad.   He literally has to be bailed out by The Angel of Bimbofication here.         Which is a big no-no, so God personally punishes Nasse by demoting her a couple ranks.    A little late for the series to start exploring these kinds of consequences for its supernatural cast members, but at least that raises the stakes a bi—    Oh COME ON   I genuinely don't know what the fuck the point of that was? Yoneda says it was all according to keikaku, presumably so that Mirai would lose his murder arrow with the demotion, but he was already about to kill the guy so like...what was he trying to accomplish?     It's just one more grain of sand in a desert of irrelevance. Platinum End, front to back, is utterly bereft of anything that matters, and given the way the series ends, I can only conclude that this is intentional.   That's more confidence than I have in what I think this ending was trying for. All I can really garner is ""making the literal child whose only desire is to off himself God is not a great long-term plan.""     I mean I wouldn't go so far as to use the word ""trying,"" because everything in the last episode is insultingly lazy. It's one big ""gotcha"" for every single character and, by extension, the audience. Posturing as deep but as flimsy as a paper tiger.    Also God kills himself lol.   Ah come on, there's some really good philosophizing in here somewhere. We just have to look!     I guess when you're an effectively omnipotent being you have nothing better to do than come up with weird metaphors about fruit.     But listen. Everyone talks about the self-deicide because it's the only interesting thing about this show. We need to at least address how this ending is also total dogshit resolution for what few characters made it to the last episode. Like how Mirai and Saki manage to get MARRIED and still look dead inside doing it.      Or you've got THIS. Which honestly would be cute in a completely different series that treated both of these characters better. And that's how much I have to stretch to say something nice here.     They're the perfect couple really. She's too shallow to demand any actual emotional connection from him, but also too stupid to recognize he's constantly insulting her. It's a match made in hell! Or I guess technically a match made in the rapture.         So here's the thrust of the ending if you don't want to watch it yourself (and you don't). God killing himself causes all life on Earth to disappear, because God created life. However, God himself was created by more advanced beings, who have seeded various Gods on planets like Earth to see if they can grow a creature capable of killing them. Because those advanced beings are immortal, and they also don't know who created them, and it sucks, and they want to die. Everything sucks. Yoneda was wrong. Mirai was wrong. Nothing matters. Fuck you.     Fuck Yoneda in particular. Even in the last fleeting moments before his existence ceases across all planes, he still has to come up with a reason why he's not wrong.        Sorry dude, but not even your shampoo bottles are gonna buy that one.   It's the final rusty nail in the show's coffin. It's the perfect emblem of its turgid nihilism. And it sorta helps a lot make sense in retrospect: its hero had no convictions, because Platinum End had none. All it had was contempt for itself and for its audience. It is, admittedly, a little fascinating in that regard, but not nearly enough to justify its own vacuous existence.   It's a show that seemed to either have no idea what it was doing, or actively hated what it was doing, sometimes both at once. It throws high concepts out with neither care nor curiosity, and in the process it also shits on incredibly personal topics without even noticing. It's a big, steaming pile of failure that stayed in the corner until it calcified.   Yeah, ultimately, I can't pretend to know what was going on in its creators' minds, but from its opening death game dirge all the way to its intellectual forfeit of an ending, it just seems to resent its own existence. What a bizarre way to be.   I'm you're interesting in something sort of similar that actually has an idea of what it's doing and isn't boring as piss, just go watch DEVILMAN crybaby and have a better time. Or re-watch Death Note. Or file your taxes.   So Steve, since you're probably the only person at this intersection, which was the worse ""End"" show: this, or World’s End Harem?

This Week in Anime Where Did Platinum End Go Wrong?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr  7th 2022           Platinum End plummeted to the bottom of the series ranking episode after episode. How did a show with a pedigree like ""from the creators of Death Note"" crash and burn so hard?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I'd like to begin with an apology. I know you were probably already prepared to bid your farewells to this show until the day unto dust we shall all return, but here I am exhuming its freshly worm-infested corpse for one final shellacking. All because I needed to know how bad Platinum End's second half had to be for the ANN community to consistently rank it lower than the softcore harem porn starring a guy who refused to have a harem.     Nick  Eh, it's fine. I've long accepted that the End is just the Beginning. And honestly it wouldn't feel right saying goodbye to this past season without flushing on this turd one last time.     If you need a refresher, we had the privilege of covering the first half at the end of last season, so you can catch up with that (https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-anime/2022-01-04/.181189). Or don't! Because nothing that happened there mattered, and this second part does a dogged job trying to do one worse.   Now now, we do technically get (have) to cover the conclusion of the show's first arc. Since last we covered it here Metropoliman's MGS boss rejects had all skedaddled and at last we were about to fight this asshole:      That's true. Let's all pour one out for God's strongest warrior.    I, for one, am shocked that a series with this particular pedigree would kill off a major antagonist midway through the series.   Hey they didn't just kill him off. They also gave us his wondrously stupid backstory! I'm sure everyone was wondering just what motivated such a complex and interesting villain.      Sure do hate it when I ""accidentally kill"" my imouto because she started talking about boys. Also I look like this the whole time. I'm the victim here.      It was definitely an accident! Why would he kill her when he so desperately wants to fuck her?        ...on second thought don't answer that question.   Here's to you and your normal one, Kanade.     Really the most horrifying part is that Metropoliman still has easily the most human motivation of any villain in this show.   That's the thing, right? And he actually has a discernable motivation, which puts him leagues beyond any of our protagonists. And, for as much shit as I have given and will give Platinum End, I'm really tickled by the fact that they made the evil siscon guy a libertarian. You know Kanade has memorized the age of consent in every country. It all fits together so well.         Also bold to make him a terminally online atheist too. When he's, you know, fighting to become God with power granted to him by an angel. And somehow that becomes a fucking running theme for this show's bad guys.     Look, just because there are glowing people with wings and halos and magic arrows doesn't NECESSARILY mean God exists. I mean, would a loving God have just stood there silently in the sky while one of his chosen children got turned into Swiss cheese?     Actually, considering everything we just mentioned about Kanade, yeah probably.   God I love how bad this show is with its own morals. Months on end of Mirai pitifully insisting that all life is precious and we should never kill anyone because that will make us all unhappy and then we get a minutes-long sequence of a dude being turned into salsa, complete with x-ray shots of the bullets tearing through his meat. Who the fuck needs ideological consistency?     I don't! I wish we got more of that! At least it isn't boring, and it taps into the ultraviolent tasteless excess that helped make Death Note so damn entertaining. Platinum End's direction still sadly doesn't hold a candle to Tetsuro Araki's over-the-top eye, but indulgences like Kanade's complete disintegration at least scratch at the door.   Unfortunately that's also the last hurrah for any slightly interesting creative decisions in this show. After that the primary director, Hideya Takahashi, promptly skipped town to work on the new Urusei Yatsura show and we were left with the visual stylings of the guy who made some of the least remembered Ghost in the Shell entries. You can tell this transition happens when everything inexplicably turns grey.     The debate settings also get more and more drab. At one point half the cast is cooped up in a chrome underground bunker.    Also this series fucking loves holding confrontations in empty sports stadiums.     I'm not gonna blow smoke up anyone's ass and say the first half of this show was visually inventive or anything. But it really is noticeable how immediate the downturn in visuals happens, and how it turns an already dull story into an endurance match.   We do definitely have to lay blame on the story too, which somehow takes the first half's philosophical stiffness and regresses into a full rigor mortis of 101-level diatribes about ontology and free will.   No need to be so wordy with this. This show becomes a Reddit argument. And not even the funny kind you see screenshots of on Twitter.      I do kinda adore this kid, though that may just be me sympathizing with any character who wants out of this story.    But you're right, it's a Reddit thread of an anime. And I'll tell you who's not winning any arguments: our hero.     Oh you're not impressed by Mirai's plan of ""let the suicidal 12-year-old become God because I don't want to?""      That's not even his plan. He's just going along with Nasse's suggestion. Mirai lacks enough of a conviction about anything to have ""plans."" He's a cipher devoid of thought or personality, beyond a vague sense that he should disagree with certain people because they happen to be the current antagonist.   Doesn't help that the person he's most attached to is also a complete nonentity. I've seen some terrible anime romances but Mirai x Saki may be the perfect blackhole of anti-chemistry.    It's amazing that for how much of their shared dialogue is just saying how being with the other makes them happiest of all, we almost never see them smile or laugh or even look mildly unbothered to be next to one another.      A romance for the ages. Positively smoldering.   Just. Good lord.    I swear I didn't edit that. That's just how this show is.   I was HOWLING at that part. My dude has a Pentium II processor up there. It's the best he can do. I also really love this still from the beginning of that scene, because it's one of the most nonfunctional shots I've ever seen. Impossible to distinguish, nothing being accomplished, featuring two characters who may as well fade into the background.     Real fucked up part is this is still probably the least awful romance Ohba's ever created. If nothing else Mirai's never gone on a rant about how ambitious women are stupid for not knowing their place, and they don't arbitrarily decide to never talk to each other until they're both famous celebrities.   When you put it like that, I guess I can't be too harsh on them. Saki also makes it out better than any other woman on the show, possibly due to the same fact that Ohba forgot to give her a personality. We have a convenient counterexample with Yuri, who's basically just a greedy one-dimensional butt of jokes.      Hey, at least the anime cut the part where we find out she's also homophobic! So she gets to just be a shallow influencer character you'd see in a Ben Garrison comic.      It's funny, cutting that specific rant out and leaving us with just the story's casual misogyny only ends up making Yuri one of the most likeable characters on the show. Certainly the most relatable.     Ironically she has probably the best plan of any of the potential God Candidates on paper. Get her some pamphlets on UBI and we might just have a happy ending after all.      Come on, Nick, we all know that there's never been a single example in all of history where providing people with additional support and welfare made their lives demonstrably and immediately better. Let's hear what an actual smart person has to say about all this.      ...still better than Mirai's idea.

This Week in Anime Where Did Platinum End Go Wrong?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr  7th 2022           Platinum End plummeted to the bottom of the series ranking episode after episode. How did a show with a pedigree like ""from the creators of Death Note"" crash and burn so hard?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I'd like to begin with an apology. I know you were probably already prepared to bid your farewells to this show until the day unto dust we shall all return, but here I am exhuming its freshly worm-infested corpse for one final shellacking. All because I needed to know how bad Platinum End's second half had to be for the ANN community to consistently rank it lower than the softcore harem porn starring a guy who refused to have a harem.     Nick  Eh, it's fine. I've long accepted that the End is just the Beginning. And honestly it wouldn't feel right saying goodbye to this past season without flushing on this turd one last time.     If you need a refresher, we had the privilege of covering the first half at the end of last season, so you can catch up with that (https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-anime/2022-01-04/.181189). Or don't! Because nothing that happened there mattered, and this second part does a dogged job trying to do one worse.   Now now, we do technically get (have) to cover the conclusion of the show's first arc. Since last we covered it here Metropoliman's MGS boss rejects had all skedaddled and at last we were about to fight this asshole:      That's true. Let's all pour one out for God's strongest warrior.    I, for one, am shocked that a series with this particular pedigree would kill off a major antagonist midway through the series.   Hey they didn't just kill him off. They also gave us his wondrously stupid backstory! I'm sure everyone was wondering just what motivated such a complex and interesting villain.      Sure do hate it when I ""accidentally kill"" my imouto because she started talking about boys. Also I look like this the whole time. I'm the victim here.      It was definitely an accident! Why would he kill her when he so desperately wants to fuck her?        ...on second thought don't answer that question.   Here's to you and your normal one, Kanade.     Really the most horrifying part is that Metropoliman still has easily the most human motivation of any villain in this show.   That's the thing, right? And he actually has a discernable motivation, which puts him leagues beyond any of our protagonists. And, for as much shit as I have given and will give Platinum End, I'm really tickled by the fact that they made the evil siscon guy a libertarian. You know Kanade has memorized the age of consent in every country. It all fits together so well.         Also bold to make him a terminally online atheist too. When he's, you know, fighting to become God with power granted to him by an angel. And somehow that becomes a fucking running theme for this show's bad guys.     Look, just because there are glowing people with wings and halos and magic arrows doesn't NECESSARILY mean God exists. I mean, would a loving God have just stood there silently in the sky while one of his chosen children got turned into Swiss cheese?     Actually, considering everything we just mentioned about Kanade, yeah probably.   God I love how bad this show is with its own morals. Months on end of Mirai pitifully insisting that all life is precious and we should never kill anyone because that will make us all unhappy and then we get a minutes-long sequence of a dude being turned into salsa, complete with x-ray shots of the bullets tearing through his meat. Who the fuck needs ideological consistency?     I don't! I wish we got more of that! At least it isn't boring, and it taps into the ultraviolent tasteless excess that helped make Death Note so damn entertaining. Platinum End's direction still sadly doesn't hold a candle to Tetsuro Araki's over-the-top eye, but indulgences like Kanade's complete disintegration at least scratch at the door.   Unfortunately that's also the last hurrah for any slightly interesting creative decisions in this show. After that the primary director, Hideya Takahashi, promptly skipped town to work on the new Urusei Yatsura show and we were left with the visual stylings of the guy who made some of the least remembered Ghost in the Shell entries. You can tell this transition happens when everything inexplicably turns grey.     The debate settings also get more and more drab. At one point half the cast is cooped up in a chrome underground bunker.    Also this series fucking loves holding confrontations in empty sports stadiums.     I'm not gonna blow smoke up anyone's ass and say the first half of this show was visually inventive or anything. But it really is noticeable how immediate the downturn in visuals happens, and how it turns an already dull story into an endurance match.   We do definitely have to lay blame on the story too, which somehow takes the first half's philosophical stiffness and regresses into a full rigor mortis of 101-level diatribes about ontology and free will.   No need to be so wordy with this. This show becomes a Reddit argument. And not even the funny kind you see screenshots of on Twitter.      I do kinda adore this kid, though that may just be me sympathizing with any character who wants out of this story.    But you're right, it's a Reddit thread of an anime. And I'll tell you who's not winning any arguments: our hero.     Oh you're not impressed by Mirai's plan of ""let the suicidal 12-year-old become God because I don't want to?""      That's not even his plan. He's just going along with Nasse's suggestion. Mirai lacks enough of a conviction about anything to have ""plans."" He's a cipher devoid of thought or personality, beyond a vague sense that he should disagree with certain people because they happen to be the current antagonist.   Doesn't help that the person he's most attached to is also a complete nonentity. I've seen some terrible anime romances but Mirai x Saki may be the perfect blackhole of anti-chemistry.    It's amazing that for how much of their shared dialogue is just saying how being with the other makes them happiest of all, we almost never see them smile or laugh or even look mildly unbothered to be next to one another.      A romance for the ages. Positively smoldering.   Just. Good lord.    I swear I didn't edit that. That's just how this show is.   I was HOWLING at that part. My dude has a Pentium II processor up there. It's the best he can do. I also really love this still from the beginning of that scene, because it's one of the most nonfunctional shots I've ever seen. Impossible to distinguish, nothing being accomplished, featuring two characters who may as well fade into the background.     Real fucked up part is this is still probably the least awful romance Ohba's ever created. If nothing else Mirai's never gone on a rant about how ambitious women are stupid for not knowing their place, and they don't arbitrarily decide to never talk to each other until they're both famous celebrities.   When you put it like that, I guess I can't be too harsh on them. Saki also makes it out better than any other woman on the show, possibly due to the same fact that Ohba forgot to give her a personality. We have a convenient counterexample with Yuri, who's basically just a greedy one-dimensional butt of jokes.      Hey, at least the anime cut the part where we find out she's also homophobic! So she gets to just be a shallow influencer character you'd see in a Ben Garrison comic.      It's funny, cutting that specific rant out and leaving us with just the story's casual misogyny only ends up making Yuri one of the most likeable characters on the show. Certainly the most relatable.     Ironically she has probably the best plan of any of the potential God Candidates on paper. Get her some pamphlets on UBI and we might just have a happy ending after all.      Come on, Nick, we all know that there's never been a single example in all of history where providing people with additional support and welfare made their lives demonstrably and immediately better. Let's hear what an actual smart person has to say about all this.      ...still better than Mirai's idea.      Dude gets handed an essay assignment and scribbles ""I dunno"" before handing it back to the teacher. I respect the honesty. He still gets an F.   I guess we finally gotta talk about the skidmark that is this show's final antagonist.     Yoneda really drags the whole show down into the mud. And it has less to do with the dude's ideas or ethics and a lot to do with the fact that he just will not shut the fuck up.   It's honestly worse in the manga. At least here you get to listen to Kenjiro Tsuda talk about total bullshit that means less than nothing. In print all you get is endless panel-sized word bubbles saying even dumber stuff.   I didn't even think about that! Absolutely miserable. He's also, for me, an anime personification of an uncomfortable reminder of my collegiate militant atheist phase. Like, yeah dude, I get it. I read Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris too. You're not special.     Doesn't help that he's supposed to be wrong but the characters he's arguing with are on the level of 3rd graders at best.      Turns out it's easy to win a debate when you just pull numbers out of your ass and nobody there has enough of a brain to question them.     Source: dude just trust me.   Also I hope you're paying attention to that totally real statistic, because it's the ONLY THING in the show that spurs Mirai to actually hold something resembling determination.    There's always going to be a struggle with shows like these, that want to have world-scale stakes but can't literally hold the world hostage, when it comes to depicting the larger population. But even by those standards this fuckin sucks:      And beyond the cringe misanthropy of that, you'd think a story like this, however poorly conceived or written, would be chomping at the bit to finally, in its climactic arc, address some fundamental questions about the concepts of God and religion. How have they helped mankind? How have they hurt mankind? Is it a net good or evil? Does it even matter, in the long run? But no, Platinum End just flattens the debate to ""7 million people will kill themselves if nobody becomes God."" That's the only thing taken in consideration going into the climax.   And even that barely matters because the actual stakes of the climax are if Mirai will sacrifice himself for Saki because every person in this show is stupid enough to walk into an obvious hostage situation.      It's okay. Mirai finally grew some gonads so he's definitely going to put the needs of the greater goo—    This kid sucks so bad.   He literally has to be bailed out by The Angel of Bimbofication here.         Which is a big no-no, so God personally punishes Nasse by demoting her a couple ranks.    A little late for the series to start exploring these kinds of consequences for its supernatural cast members, but at least that raises the stakes a bi—    Oh COME ON   I genuinely don't know what the fuck the point of that was? Yoneda says it was all according to keikaku, presumably so that Mirai would lose his murder arrow with the demotion, but he was already about to kill the guy so like...what was he trying to accomplish?     It's just one more grain of sand in a desert of irrelevance. Platinum End, front to back, is utterly bereft of anything that matters, and given the way the series ends, I can only conclude that this is intentional.   That's more confidence than I have in what I think this ending was trying for. All I can really garner is ""making the literal child whose only desire is to off himself God is not a great long-term plan.""     I mean I wouldn't go so far as to use the word ""trying,"" because everything in the last episode is insultingly lazy. It's one big ""gotcha"" for every single character and, by extension, the audience. Posturing as deep but as flimsy as a paper tiger.    Also God kills himself lol.   Ah come on, there's some really good philosophizing in here somewhere. We just have to look!     I guess when you're an effectively omnipotent being you have nothing better to do than come up with weird metaphors about fruit.     But listen. Everyone talks about the self-deicide because it's the only interesting thing about this show. We need to at least address how this ending is also total dogshit resolution for what few characters made it to the last episode. Like how Mirai and Saki manage to get MARRIED and still look dead inside doing it.      Or you've got THIS. Which honestly would be cute in a completely different series that treated both of these characters better. And that's how much I have to stretch to say something nice here.     They're the perfect couple really. She's too shallow to demand any actual emotional connection from him, but also too stupid to recognize he's constantly insulting her. It's a match made in hell! Or I guess technically a match made in the rapture.         So here's the thrust of the ending if you don't want to watch it yourself (and you don't). God killing himself causes all life on Earth to disappear, because God created life. However, God himself was created by more advanced beings, who have seeded various Gods on planets like Earth to see if they can grow a creature capable of killing them. Because those advanced beings are immortal, and they also don't know who created them, and it sucks, and they want to die. Everything sucks. Yoneda was wrong. Mirai was wrong. Nothing matters. Fuck you.     Fuck Yoneda in particular. Even in the last fleeting moments before his existence ceases across all planes, he still has to come up with a reason why he's not wrong.        Sorry dude, but not even your shampoo bottles are gonna buy that one.   It's the final rusty nail in the show's coffin. It's the perfect emblem of its turgid nihilism. And it sorta helps a lot make sense in retrospect: its hero had no convictions, because Platinum End had none. All it had was contempt for itself and for its audience. It is, admittedly, a little fascinating in that regard, but not nearly enough to justify its own vacuous existence.   It's a show that seemed to either have no idea what it was doing, or actively hated what it was doing, sometimes both at once. It throws high concepts out with neither care nor curiosity, and in the process it also shits on incredibly personal topics without even noticing. It's a big, steaming pile of failure that stayed in the corner until it calcified.   Yeah, ultimately, I can't pretend to know what was going on in its creators' minds, but from its opening death game dirge all the way to its intellectual forfeit of an ending, it just seems to resent its own existence. What a bizarre way to be.   I'm you're interesting in something sort of similar that actually has an idea of what it's doing and isn't boring as piss, just go watch DEVILMAN crybaby and have a better time. Or re-watch Death Note. Or file your taxes.   So Steve, since you're probably the only person at this intersection, which was the worse ""End"" show: this, or World’s End Harem?

And it sorta helps a lot make sense in retrospect: its hero had no convictions, because Platinum End had none. All it had was contempt for itself and for its audience. It is, admittedly, a little fascinating in that regard, but not nearly enough to justify its own vacuous existence.   It's a show that seemed to either have no idea what it was doing, or actively hated what it was doing, sometimes both at once. It throws high concepts out with neither care nor curiosity, and in the process it also shits on incredibly personal topics without even noticing. It's a big, steaming pile of failure that stayed in the corner until it calcified.   Yeah, ultimately, I can't pretend to know what was going on in its creators' minds, but from its opening death game dirge all the way to its intellectual forfeit of an ending, it just seems to resent its own existence. What a bizarre way to be.   I'm you're interesting in something sort of similar that actually has an idea of what it's doing and isn't boring as piss, just go watch DEVILMAN crybaby and have a better time. Or re-watch Death Note. Or file your taxes.   So Steve, since you're probably the only person at this intersection, which was the worse ""End"" show: this, or World’s End Harem?    I've got just the answer for you:           discuss this in the forum (28 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives      ",positive,en,{}
09-04-2022,anime,3,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-anime/2022-04-07/.184417,Where Did Platinum End Go Wrong? - This Week in Anime - Anime News Network:SEA,"      This Week in Anime Where Did Platinum End Go Wrong?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr  7th 2022           Platinum End plummeted to the bottom of the series ranking episode after episode. How did a show with a pedigree like ""from the creators of Death Note"" crash and burn so hard?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I'd like to begin with an apology. I know you were probably already prepared to bid your farewells to this show until the day unto dust we shall all return, but here I am exhuming its freshly worm-infested corpse for one final shellacking. All because I needed to know how bad Platinum End's second half had to be for the ANN community to consistently rank it lower than the softcore harem porn starring a guy who refused to have a harem.     Nick  Eh, it's fine. I've long accepted that the End is just the Beginning. And honestly it wouldn't feel right saying goodbye to this past season without flushing on this turd one last time.     If you need a refresher, we had the privilege of covering the first half at the end of last season, so you can catch up with that (https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-anime/2022-01-04/.181189). Or don't! Because nothing that happened there mattered, and this second part does a dogged job trying to do one worse.   Now now, we do technically get (have) to cover the conclusion of the show's first arc. Since last we covered it here Metropoliman's MGS boss rejects had all skedaddled and at last we were about to fight this asshole:      That's true. Let's all pour one out for God's strongest warrior.    I, for one, am shocked that a series with this particular pedigree would kill off a major antagonist midway through the series.   Hey they didn't just kill him off. They also gave us his wondrously stupid backstory! I'm sure everyone was wondering just what motivated such a complex and interesting villain.      Sure do hate it when I ""accidentally kill"" my imouto because she started talking about boys. Also I look like this the whole time. I'm the victim here.      It was definitely an accident! Why would he kill her when he so desperately wants to fuck her?        ...on second thought don't answer that question.   Here's to you and your normal one, Kanade.     Really the most horrifying part is that Metropoliman still has easily the most human motivation of any villain in this show.   That's the thing, right? And he actually has a discernable motivation, which puts him leagues beyond any of our protagonists. And, for as much shit as I have given and will give Platinum End, I'm really tickled by the fact that they made the evil siscon guy a libertarian. You know Kanade has memorized the age of consent in every country. It all fits together so well.         Also bold to make him a terminally online atheist too. When he's, you know, fighting to become God with power granted to him by an angel. And somehow that becomes a fucking running theme for this show's bad guys.     Look, just because there are glowing people with wings and halos and magic arrows doesn't NECESSARILY mean God exists. I mean, would a loving God have just stood there silently in the sky while one of his chosen children got turned into Swiss cheese?     Actually, considering everything we just mentioned about Kanade, yeah probably.   God I love how bad this show is with its own morals. Months on end of Mirai pitifully insisting that all life is precious and we should never kill anyone because that will make us all unhappy and then we get a minutes-long sequence of a dude being turned into salsa, complete with x-ray shots of the bullets tearing through his meat. Who the fuck needs ideological consistency?     I don't! I wish we got more of that! At least it isn't boring, and it taps into the ultraviolent tasteless excess that helped make Death Note so damn entertaining. Platinum End's direction still sadly doesn't hold a candle to Tetsuro Araki's over-the-top eye, but indulgences like Kanade's complete disintegration at least scratch at the door.   Unfortunately that's also the last hurrah for any slightly interesting creative decisions in this show. After that the primary director, Hideya Takahashi, promptly skipped town to work on the new Urusei Yatsura show and we were left with the visual stylings of the guy who made some of the least remembered Ghost in the Shell entries. You can tell this transition happens when everything inexplicably turns grey.     The debate settings also get more and more drab. At one point half the cast is cooped up in a chrome underground bunker.    Also this series fucking loves holding confrontations in empty sports stadiums.     I'm not gonna blow smoke up anyone's ass and say the first half of this show was visually inventive or anything. But it really is noticeable how immediate the downturn in visuals happens, and how it turns an already dull story into an endurance match.   We do definitely have to lay blame on the story too, which somehow takes the first half's philosophical stiffness and regresses into a full rigor mortis of 101-level diatribes about ontology and free will.   No need to be so wordy with this. This show becomes a Reddit argument. And not even the funny kind you see screenshots of on Twitter.      I do kinda adore this kid, though that may just be me sympathizing with any character who wants out of this story.    But you're right, it's a Reddit thread of an anime. And I'll tell you who's not winning any arguments: our hero.     Oh you're not impressed by Mirai's plan of ""let the suicidal 12-year-old become God because I don't want to?""      That's not even his plan. He's just going along with Nasse's suggestion. Mirai lacks enough of a conviction about anything to have ""plans."" He's a cipher devoid of thought or personality, beyond a vague sense that he should disagree with certain people because they happen to be the current antagonist.   Doesn't help that the person he's most attached to is also a complete nonentity. I've seen some terrible anime romances but Mirai x Saki may be the perfect blackhole of anti-chemistry.    It's amazing that for how much of their shared dialogue is just saying how being with the other makes them happiest of all, we almost never see them smile or laugh or even look mildly unbothered to be next to one another.      A romance for the ages. Positively smoldering.   Just. Good lord.    I swear I didn't edit that. That's just how this show is.   I was HOWLING at that part. My dude has a Pentium II processor up there. It's the best he can do. I also really love this still from the beginning of that scene, because it's one of the most nonfunctional shots I've ever seen. Impossible to distinguish, nothing being accomplished, featuring two characters who may as well fade into the background.     Real fucked up part is this is still probably the least awful romance Ohba's ever created. If nothing else Mirai's never gone on a rant about how ambitious women are stupid for not knowing their place, and they don't arbitrarily decide to never talk to each other until they're both famous celebrities.   When you put it like that, I guess I can't be too harsh on them. Saki also makes it out better than any other woman on the show, possibly due to the same fact that Ohba forgot to give her a personality. We have a convenient counterexample with Yuri, who's basically just a greedy one-dimensional butt of jokes.      Hey, at least the anime cut the part where we find out she's also homophobic! So she gets to just be a shallow influencer character you'd see in a Ben Garrison comic.      It's funny, cutting that specific rant out and leaving us with just the story's casual misogyny only ends up making Yuri one of the most likeable characters on the show. Certainly the most relatable.     Ironically she has probably the best plan of any of the potential God Candidates on paper. Get her some pamphlets on UBI and we might just have a happy ending after all.      Come on, Nick, we all know that there's never been a single example in all of history where providing people with additional support and welfare made their lives demonstrably and immediately better. Let's hear what an actual smart person has to say about all this.      ...still better than Mirai's idea.      Dude gets handed an essay assignment and scribbles ""I dunno"" before handing it back to the teacher. I respect the honesty. He still gets an F.   I guess we finally gotta talk about the skidmark that is this show's final antagonist.     Yoneda really drags the whole show down into the mud. And it has less to do with the dude's ideas or ethics and a lot to do with the fact that he just will not shut the fuck up.   It's honestly worse in the manga. At least here you get to listen to Kenjiro Tsuda talk about total bullshit that means less than nothing. In print all you get is endless panel-sized word bubbles saying even dumber stuff.   I didn't even think about that! Absolutely miserable. He's also, for me, an anime personification of an uncomfortable reminder of my collegiate militant atheist phase. Like, yeah dude, I get it. I read Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris too. You're not special.     Doesn't help that he's supposed to be wrong but the characters he's arguing with are on the level of 3rd graders at best.      Turns out it's easy to win a debate when you just pull numbers out of your ass and nobody there has enough of a brain to question them.     Source: dude just trust me.   Also I hope you're paying attention to that totally real statistic, because it's the ONLY THING in the show that spurs Mirai to actually hold something resembling determination.    There's always going to be a struggle with shows like these, that want to have world-scale stakes but can't literally hold the world hostage, when it comes to depicting the larger population. But even by those standards this fuckin sucks:      And beyond the cringe misanthropy of that, you'd think a story like this, however poorly conceived or written, would be chomping at the bit to finally, in its climactic arc, address some fundamental questions about the concepts of God and religion. How have they helped mankind? How have they hurt mankind? Is it a net good or evil? Does it even matter, in the long run? But no, Platinum End just flattens the debate to ""7 million people will kill themselves if nobody becomes God."" That's the only thing taken in consideration going into the climax.   And even that barely matters because the actual stakes of the climax are if Mirai will sacrifice himself for Saki because every person in this show is stupid enough to walk into an obvious hostage situation.      It's okay. Mirai finally grew some gonads so he's definitely going to put the needs of the greater goo—    This kid sucks so bad.   He literally has to be bailed out by The Angel of Bimbofication here.         Which is a big no-no, so God personally punishes Nasse by demoting her a couple ranks.    A little late for the series to start exploring these kinds of consequences for its supernatural cast members, but at least that raises the stakes a bi—    Oh COME ON   I genuinely don't know what the fuck the point of that was? Yoneda says it was all according to keikaku, presumably so that Mirai would lose his murder arrow with the demotion, but he was already about to kill the guy so like...what was he trying to accomplish?     It's just one more grain of sand in a desert of irrelevance. Platinum End, front to back, is utterly bereft of anything that matters, and given the way the series ends, I can only conclude that this is intentional.   That's more confidence than I have in what I think this ending was trying for. All I can really garner is ""making the literal child whose only desire is to off himself God is not a great long-term plan.""     I mean I wouldn't go so far as to use the word ""trying,"" because everything in the last episode is insultingly lazy. It's one big ""gotcha"" for every single character and, by extension, the audience. Posturing as deep but as flimsy as a paper tiger.    Also God kills himself lol.   Ah come on, there's some really good philosophizing in here somewhere. We just have to look!     I guess when you're an effectively omnipotent being you have nothing better to do than come up with weird metaphors about fruit.     But listen. Everyone talks about the self-deicide because it's the only interesting thing about this show. We need to at least address how this ending is also total dogshit resolution for what few characters made it to the last episode. Like how Mirai and Saki manage to get MARRIED and still look dead inside doing it.      Or you've got THIS. Which honestly would be cute in a completely different series that treated both of these characters better. And that's how much I have to stretch to say something nice here.     They're the perfect couple really. She's too shallow to demand any actual emotional connection from him, but also too stupid to recognize he's constantly insulting her. It's a match made in hell! Or I guess technically a match made in the rapture.         So here's the thrust of the ending if you don't want to watch it yourself (and you don't). God killing himself causes all life on Earth to disappear, because God created life. However, God himself was created by more advanced beings, who have seeded various Gods on planets like Earth to see if they can grow a creature capable of killing them. Because those advanced beings are immortal, and they also don't know who created them, and it sucks, and they want to die. Everything sucks. Yoneda was wrong. Mirai was wrong. Nothing matters. Fuck you.     Fuck Yoneda in particular. Even in the last fleeting moments before his existence ceases across all planes, he still has to come up with a reason why he's not wrong.        Sorry dude, but not even your shampoo bottles are gonna buy that one.   It's the final rusty nail in the show's coffin. It's the perfect emblem of its turgid nihilism. And it sorta helps a lot make sense in retrospect: its hero had no convictions, because Platinum End had none. All it had was contempt for itself and for its audience.

Fuck you.     Fuck Yoneda in particular. Even in the last fleeting moments before his existence ceases across all planes, he still has to come up with a reason why he's not wrong.        Sorry dude, but not even your shampoo bottles are gonna buy that one.   It's the final rusty nail in the show's coffin. It's the perfect emblem of its turgid nihilism. And it sorta helps a lot make sense in retrospect: its hero had no convictions, because Platinum End had none. All it had was contempt for itself and for its audience. It is, admittedly, a little fascinating in that regard, but not nearly enough to justify its own vacuous existence.   It's a show that seemed to either have no idea what it was doing, or actively hated what it was doing, sometimes both at once. It throws high concepts out with neither care nor curiosity, and in the process it also shits on incredibly personal topics without even noticing. It's a big, steaming pile of failure that stayed in the corner until it calcified.   Yeah, ultimately, I can't pretend to know what was going on in its creators' minds, but from its opening death game dirge all the way to its intellectual forfeit of an ending, it just seems to resent its own existence. What a bizarre way to be.   I'm you're interesting in something sort of similar that actually has an idea of what it's doing and isn't boring as piss, just go watch DEVILMAN crybaby and have a better time. Or re-watch Death Note. Or file your taxes.   So Steve, since you're probably the only person at this intersection, which was the worse ""End"" show: this, or World’s End Harem?

09-04-2022,anime,3,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-anime/2022-04-07/.184417,Where Did Platinum End Go Wrong? - This Week in Anime - Anime News Network:SEA,"        Platinum End plummeted to the bottom of the series ranking episode after episode. How did a show with a pedigree like ""from the creators of Death Note"" crash and burn so hard?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I'd like to begin with an apology. I know you were probably already prepared to bid your farewells to this show until the day unto dust we shall all return, but here I am exhuming its freshly worm-infested corpse for one final shellacking. All because I needed to know how bad Platinum End's second half had to be for the ANN community to consistently rank it lower than the softcore harem porn starring a guy who refused to have a harem.     Nick  Eh, it's fine. I've long accepted that the End is just the Beginning. And honestly it wouldn't feel right saying goodbye to this past season without flushing on this turd one last time.     If you need a refresher, we had the privilege of covering the first half at the end of last season, so you can catch up with that (https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-anime/2022-01-04/.181189). Or don't! Because nothing that happened there mattered, and this second part does a dogged job trying to do one worse.   Now now, we do technically get (have) to cover the conclusion of the show's first arc. Since last we covered it here Metropoliman's MGS boss rejects had all skedaddled and at last we were about to fight this asshole:      That's true. Let's all pour one out for God's strongest warrior.    I, for one, am shocked that a series with this particular pedigree would kill off a major antagonist midway through the series.   Hey they didn't just kill him off. They also gave us his wondrously stupid backstory! I'm sure everyone was wondering just what motivated such a complex and interesting villain.      Sure do hate it when I ""accidentally kill"" my imouto because she started talking about boys. Also I look like this the whole time. I'm the victim here.      It was definitely an accident! Why would he kill her when he so desperately wants to fuck her?        ...on second thought don't answer that question.   Here's to you and your normal one, Kanade.     Really the most horrifying part is that Metropoliman still has easily the most human motivation of any villain in this show.   That's the thing, right? And he actually has a discernable motivation, which puts him leagues beyond any of our protagonists. And, for as much shit as I have given and will give Platinum End, I'm really tickled by the fact that they made the evil siscon guy a libertarian. You know Kanade has memorized the age of consent in every country. It all fits together so well.         Also bold to make him a terminally online atheist too. When he's, you know, fighting to become God with power granted to him by an angel. And somehow that becomes a fucking running theme for this show's bad guys.     Look, just because there are glowing people with wings and halos and magic arrows doesn't NECESSARILY mean God exists. I mean, would a loving God have just stood there silently in the sky while one of his chosen children got turned into Swiss cheese?     Actually, considering everything we just mentioned about Kanade, yeah probably.   God I love how bad this show is with its own morals. Months on end of Mirai pitifully insisting that all life is precious and we should never kill anyone because that will make us all unhappy and then we get a minutes-long sequence of a dude being turned into salsa, complete with x-ray shots of the bullets tearing through his meat. Who the fuck needs ideological consistency?     I don't! I wish we got more of that! At least it isn't boring, and it taps into the ultraviolent tasteless excess that helped make Death Note so damn entertaining. Platinum End's direction still sadly doesn't hold a candle to Tetsuro Araki's over-the-top eye, but indulgences like Kanade's complete disintegration at least scratch at the door.   Unfortunately that's also the last hurrah for any slightly interesting creative decisions in this show. After that the primary director, Hideya Takahashi, promptly skipped town to work on the new Urusei Yatsura show and we were left with the visual stylings of the guy who made some of the least remembered Ghost in the Shell entries. You can tell this transition happens when everything inexplicably turns grey.     The debate settings also get more and more drab. At one point half the cast is cooped up in a chrome underground bunker.    Also this series fucking loves holding confrontations in empty sports stadiums.     I'm not gonna blow smoke up anyone's ass and say the first half of this show was visually inventive or anything. But it really is noticeable how immediate the downturn in visuals happens, and how it turns an already dull story into an endurance match.   We do definitely have to lay blame on the story too, which somehow takes the first half's philosophical stiffness and regresses into a full rigor mortis of 101-level diatribes about ontology and free will.   No need to be so wordy with this. This show becomes a Reddit argument. And not even the funny kind you see screenshots of on Twitter.      I do kinda adore this kid, though that may just be me sympathizing with any character who wants out of this story.    But you're right, it's a Reddit thread of an anime. And I'll tell you who's not winning any arguments: our hero.     Oh you're not impressed by Mirai's plan of ""let the suicidal 12-year-old become God because I don't want to?""      That's not even his plan. He's just going along with Nasse's suggestion. Mirai lacks enough of a conviction about anything to have ""plans."" He's a cipher devoid of thought or personality, beyond a vague sense that he should disagree with certain people because they happen to be the current antagonist.   Doesn't help that the person he's most attached to is also a complete nonentity. I've seen some terrible anime romances but Mirai x Saki may be the perfect blackhole of anti-chemistry.    It's amazing that for how much of their shared dialogue is just saying how being with the other makes them happiest of all, we almost never see them smile or laugh or even look mildly unbothered to be next to one another.      A romance for the ages. Positively smoldering.   Just. Good lord.    I swear I didn't edit that. That's just how this show is.   I was HOWLING at that part. My dude has a Pentium II processor up there. It's the best he can do. I also really love this still from the beginning of that scene, because it's one of the most nonfunctional shots I've ever seen. Impossible to distinguish, nothing being accomplished, featuring two characters who may as well fade into the background.     Real fucked up part is this is still probably the least awful romance Ohba's ever created. If nothing else Mirai's never gone on a rant about how ambitious women are stupid for not knowing their place, and they don't arbitrarily decide to never talk to each other until they're both famous celebrities.   When you put it like that, I guess I can't be too harsh on them. Saki also makes it out better than any other woman on the show, possibly due to the same fact that Ohba forgot to give her a personality. We have a convenient counterexample with Yuri, who's basically just a greedy one-dimensional butt of jokes.      Hey, at least the anime cut the part where we find out she's also homophobic! So she gets to just be a shallow influencer character you'd see in a Ben Garrison comic.      It's funny, cutting that specific rant out and leaving us with just the story's casual misogyny only ends up making Yuri one of the most likeable characters on the show. Certainly the most relatable.     Ironically she has probably the best plan of any of the potential God Candidates on paper. Get her some pamphlets on UBI and we might just have a happy ending after all.      Come on, Nick, we all know that there's never been a single example in all of history where providing people with additional support and welfare made their lives demonstrably and immediately better. Let's hear what an actual smart person has to say about all this.      ...still better than Mirai's idea.      Dude gets handed an essay assignment and scribbles ""I dunno"" before handing it back to the teacher. I respect the honesty. He still gets an F.   I guess we finally gotta talk about the skidmark that is this show's final antagonist.     Yoneda really drags the whole show down into the mud. And it has less to do with the dude's ideas or ethics and a lot to do with the fact that he just will not shut the fuck up.   It's honestly worse in the manga. At least here you get to listen to Kenjiro Tsuda talk about total bullshit that means less than nothing. In print all you get is endless panel-sized word bubbles saying even dumber stuff.   I didn't even think about that! Absolutely miserable. He's also, for me, an anime personification of an uncomfortable reminder of my collegiate militant atheist phase. Like, yeah dude, I get it. I read Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris too. You're not special.     Doesn't help that he's supposed to be wrong but the characters he's arguing with are on the level of 3rd graders at best.      Turns out it's easy to win a debate when you just pull numbers out of your ass and nobody there has enough of a brain to question them.     Source: dude just trust me.   Also I hope you're paying attention to that totally real statistic, because it's the ONLY THING in the show that spurs Mirai to actually hold something resembling determination.    There's always going to be a struggle with shows like these, that want to have world-scale stakes but can't literally hold the world hostage, when it comes to depicting the larger population. But even by those standards this fuckin sucks:      And beyond the cringe misanthropy of that, you'd think a story like this, however poorly conceived or written, would be chomping at the bit to finally, in its climactic arc, address some fundamental questions about the concepts of God and religion. How have they helped mankind? How have they hurt mankind? Is it a net good or evil? Does it even matter, in the long run? But no, Platinum End just flattens the debate to ""7 million people will kill themselves if nobody becomes God."" That's the only thing taken in consideration going into the climax.   And even that barely matters because the actual stakes of the climax are if Mirai will sacrifice himself for Saki because every person in this show is stupid enough to walk into an obvious hostage situation.      It's okay. Mirai finally grew some gonads so he's definitely going to put the needs of the greater goo—    This kid sucks so bad.   He literally has to be bailed out by The Angel of Bimbofication here.         Which is a big no-no, so God personally punishes Nasse by demoting her a couple ranks.    A little late for the series to start exploring these kinds of consequences for its supernatural cast members, but at least that raises the stakes a bi—    Oh COME ON   I genuinely don't know what the fuck the point of that was? Yoneda says it was all according to keikaku, presumably so that Mirai would lose his murder arrow with the demotion, but he was already about to kill the guy so like...what was he trying to accomplish?     It's just one more grain of sand in a desert of irrelevance. Platinum End, front to back, is utterly bereft of anything that matters, and given the way the series ends, I can only conclude that this is intentional.   That's more confidence than I have in what I think this ending was trying for. All I can really garner is ""making the literal child whose only desire is to off himself God is not a great long-term plan.""     I mean I wouldn't go so far as to use the word ""trying,"" because everything in the last episode is insultingly lazy. It's one big ""gotcha"" for every single character and, by extension, the audience. Posturing as deep but as flimsy as a paper tiger.    Also God kills himself lol.   Ah come on, there's some really good philosophizing in here somewhere. We just have to look!     I guess when you're an effectively omnipotent being you have nothing better to do than come up with weird metaphors about fruit.     But listen. Everyone talks about the self-deicide because it's the only interesting thing about this show. We need to at least address how this ending is also total dogshit resolution for what few characters made it to the last episode. Like how Mirai and Saki manage to get MARRIED and still look dead inside doing it.      Or you've got THIS. Which honestly would be cute in a completely different series that treated both of these characters better. And that's how much I have to stretch to say something nice here.     They're the perfect couple really. She's too shallow to demand any actual emotional connection from him, but also too stupid to recognize he's constantly insulting her. It's a match made in hell! Or I guess technically a match made in the rapture.         So here's the thrust of the ending if you don't want to watch it yourself (and you don't). God killing himself causes all life on Earth to disappear, because God created life. However, God himself was created by more advanced beings, who have seeded various Gods on planets like Earth to see if they can grow a creature capable of killing them. Because those advanced beings are immortal, and they also don't know who created them, and it sucks, and they want to die. Everything sucks. Yoneda was wrong. Mirai was wrong. Nothing matters. Fuck you.     Fuck Yoneda in particular. Even in the last fleeting moments before his existence ceases across all planes, he still has to come up with a reason why he's not wrong.

Because those advanced beings are immortal, and they also don't know who created them, and it sucks, and they want to die. Everything sucks. Yoneda was wrong. Mirai was wrong. Nothing matters. Fuck you.     Fuck Yoneda in particular. Even in the last fleeting moments before his existence ceases across all planes, he still has to come up with a reason why he's not wrong.        Sorry dude, but not even your shampoo bottles are gonna buy that one.   It's the final rusty nail in the show's coffin. It's the perfect emblem of its turgid nihilism. And it sorta helps a lot make sense in retrospect: its hero had no convictions, because Platinum End had none. All it had was contempt for itself and for its audience. It is, admittedly, a little fascinating in that regard, but not nearly enough to justify its own vacuous existence.   It's a show that seemed to either have no idea what it was doing, or actively hated what it was doing, sometimes both at once. It throws high concepts out with neither care nor curiosity, and in the process it also shits on incredibly personal topics without even noticing. It's a big, steaming pile of failure that stayed in the corner until it calcified.   Yeah, ultimately, I can't pretend to know what was going on in its creators' minds, but from its opening death game dirge all the way to its intellectual forfeit of an ending, it just seems to resent its own existence. What a bizarre way to be.   I'm you're interesting in something sort of similar that actually has an idea of what it's doing and isn't boring as piss, just go watch DEVILMAN crybaby and have a better time. Or re-watch Death Note. Or file your taxes.   So Steve, since you're probably the only person at this intersection, which was the worse ""End"" show: this, or World’s End Harem?

09-04-2022,anime,3,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-anime/2022-04-07/.184417,Where Did Platinum End Go Wrong? - This Week in Anime - Anime News Network:SEA,"    Platinum End plummeted to the bottom of the series ranking episode after episode. How did a show with a pedigree like ""from the creators of Death Note"" crash and burn so hard?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, I'd like to begin with an apology. I know you were probably already prepared to bid your farewells to this show until the day unto dust we shall all return, but here I am exhuming its freshly worm-infested corpse for one final shellacking. All because I needed to know how bad Platinum End's second half had to be for the ANN community to consistently rank it lower than the softcore harem porn starring a guy who refused to have a harem.     Nick  Eh, it's fine. I've long accepted that the End is just the Beginning. And honestly it wouldn't feel right saying goodbye to this past season without flushing on this turd one last time.     If you need a refresher, we had the privilege of covering the first half at the end of last season, so you can catch up with that (https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-anime/2022-01-04/.181189). Or don't! Because nothing that happened there mattered, and this second part does a dogged job trying to do one worse.   Now now, we do technically get (have) to cover the conclusion of the show's first arc. Since last we covered it here Metropoliman's MGS boss rejects had all skedaddled and at last we were about to fight this asshole:      That's true. Let's all pour one out for God's strongest warrior.    I, for one, am shocked that a series with this particular pedigree would kill off a major antagonist midway through the series.   Hey they didn't just kill him off. They also gave us his wondrously stupid backstory! I'm sure everyone was wondering just what motivated such a complex and interesting villain.      Sure do hate it when I ""accidentally kill"" my imouto because she started talking about boys. Also I look like this the whole time. I'm the victim here.      It was definitely an accident! Why would he kill her when he so desperately wants to fuck her?        ...on second thought don't answer that question.   Here's to you and your normal one, Kanade.     Really the most horrifying part is that Metropoliman still has easily the most human motivation of any villain in this show.   That's the thing, right? And he actually has a discernable motivation, which puts him leagues beyond any of our protagonists. And, for as much shit as I have given and will give Platinum End, I'm really tickled by the fact that they made the evil siscon guy a libertarian. You know Kanade has memorized the age of consent in every country. It all fits together so well.         Also bold to make him a terminally online atheist too. When he's, you know, fighting to become God with power granted to him by an angel. And somehow that becomes a fucking running theme for this show's bad guys.     Look, just because there are glowing people with wings and halos and magic arrows doesn't NECESSARILY mean God exists. I mean, would a loving God have just stood there silently in the sky while one of his chosen children got turned into Swiss cheese?     Actually, considering everything we just mentioned about Kanade, yeah probably.   God I love how bad this show is with its own morals. Months on end of Mirai pitifully insisting that all life is precious and we should never kill anyone because that will make us all unhappy and then we get a minutes-long sequence of a dude being turned into salsa, complete with x-ray shots of the bullets tearing through his meat. Who the fuck needs ideological consistency?     I don't! I wish we got more of that! At least it isn't boring, and it taps into the ultraviolent tasteless excess that helped make Death Note so damn entertaining. Platinum End's direction still sadly doesn't hold a candle to Tetsuro Araki's over-the-top eye, but indulgences like Kanade's complete disintegration at least scratch at the door.   Unfortunately that's also the last hurrah for any slightly interesting creative decisions in this show. After that the primary director, Hideya Takahashi, promptly skipped town to work on the new Urusei Yatsura show and we were left with the visual stylings of the guy who made some of the least remembered Ghost in the Shell entries. You can tell this transition happens when everything inexplicably turns grey.     The debate settings also get more and more drab. At one point half the cast is cooped up in a chrome underground bunker.    Also this series fucking loves holding confrontations in empty sports stadiums.     I'm not gonna blow smoke up anyone's ass and say the first half of this show was visually inventive or anything. But it really is noticeable how immediate the downturn in visuals happens, and how it turns an already dull story into an endurance match.   We do definitely have to lay blame on the story too, which somehow takes the first half's philosophical stiffness and regresses into a full rigor mortis of 101-level diatribes about ontology and free will.   No need to be so wordy with this. This show becomes a Reddit argument. And not even the funny kind you see screenshots of on Twitter.      I do kinda adore this kid, though that may just be me sympathizing with any character who wants out of this story.    But you're right, it's a Reddit thread of an anime. And I'll tell you who's not winning any arguments: our hero.     Oh you're not impressed by Mirai's plan of ""let the suicidal 12-year-old become God because I don't want to?""      That's not even his plan. He's just going along with Nasse's suggestion. Mirai lacks enough of a conviction about anything to have ""plans."" He's a cipher devoid of thought or personality, beyond a vague sense that he should disagree with certain people because they happen to be the current antagonist.   Doesn't help that the person he's most attached to is also a complete nonentity. I've seen some terrible anime romances but Mirai x Saki may be the perfect blackhole of anti-chemistry.    It's amazing that for how much of their shared dialogue is just saying how being with the other makes them happiest of all, we almost never see them smile or laugh or even look mildly unbothered to be next to one another.      A romance for the ages. Positively smoldering.   Just. Good lord.    I swear I didn't edit that. That's just how this show is.   I was HOWLING at that part. My dude has a Pentium II processor up there. It's the best he can do. I also really love this still from the beginning of that scene, because it's one of the most nonfunctional shots I've ever seen. Impossible to distinguish, nothing being accomplished, featuring two characters who may as well fade into the background.     Real fucked up part is this is still probably the least awful romance Ohba's ever created. If nothing else Mirai's never gone on a rant about how ambitious women are stupid for not knowing their place, and they don't arbitrarily decide to never talk to each other until they're both famous celebrities.   When you put it like that, I guess I can't be too harsh on them. Saki also makes it out better than any other woman on the show, possibly due to the same fact that Ohba forgot to give her a personality. We have a convenient counterexample with Yuri, who's basically just a greedy one-dimensional butt of jokes.      Hey, at least the anime cut the part where we find out she's also homophobic! So she gets to just be a shallow influencer character you'd see in a Ben Garrison comic.      It's funny, cutting that specific rant out and leaving us with just the story's casual misogyny only ends up making Yuri one of the most likeable characters on the show. Certainly the most relatable.     Ironically she has probably the best plan of any of the potential God Candidates on paper. Get her some pamphlets on UBI and we might just have a happy ending after all.      Come on, Nick, we all know that there's never been a single example in all of history where providing people with additional support and welfare made their lives demonstrably and immediately better. Let's hear what an actual smart person has to say about all this.      ...still better than Mirai's idea.      Dude gets handed an essay assignment and scribbles ""I dunno"" before handing it back to the teacher. I respect the honesty. He still gets an F.   I guess we finally gotta talk about the skidmark that is this show's final antagonist.     Yoneda really drags the whole show down into the mud. And it has less to do with the dude's ideas or ethics and a lot to do with the fact that he just will not shut the fuck up.   It's honestly worse in the manga. At least here you get to listen to Kenjiro Tsuda talk about total bullshit that means less than nothing. In print all you get is endless panel-sized word bubbles saying even dumber stuff.   I didn't even think about that! Absolutely miserable. He's also, for me, an anime personification of an uncomfortable reminder of my collegiate militant atheist phase. Like, yeah dude, I get it. I read Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris too. You're not special.     Doesn't help that he's supposed to be wrong but the characters he's arguing with are on the level of 3rd graders at best.      Turns out it's easy to win a debate when you just pull numbers out of your ass and nobody there has enough of a brain to question them.     Source: dude just trust me.   Also I hope you're paying attention to that totally real statistic, because it's the ONLY THING in the show that spurs Mirai to actually hold something resembling determination.    There's always going to be a struggle with shows like these, that want to have world-scale stakes but can't literally hold the world hostage, when it comes to depicting the larger population. But even by those standards this fuckin sucks:      And beyond the cringe misanthropy of that, you'd think a story like this, however poorly conceived or written, would be chomping at the bit to finally, in its climactic arc, address some fundamental questions about the concepts of God and religion. How have they helped mankind? How have they hurt mankind? Is it a net good or evil? Does it even matter, in the long run? But no, Platinum End just flattens the debate to ""7 million people will kill themselves if nobody becomes God."" That's the only thing taken in consideration going into the climax.   And even that barely matters because the actual stakes of the climax are if Mirai will sacrifice himself for Saki because every person in this show is stupid enough to walk into an obvious hostage situation.      It's okay. Mirai finally grew some gonads so he's definitely going to put the needs of the greater goo—    This kid sucks so bad.   He literally has to be bailed out by The Angel of Bimbofication here.         Which is a big no-no, so God personally punishes Nasse by demoting her a couple ranks.    A little late for the series to start exploring these kinds of consequences for its supernatural cast members, but at least that raises the stakes a bi—    Oh COME ON   I genuinely don't know what the fuck the point of that was? Yoneda says it was all according to keikaku, presumably so that Mirai would lose his murder arrow with the demotion, but he was already about to kill the guy so like...what was he trying to accomplish?     It's just one more grain of sand in a desert of irrelevance. Platinum End, front to back, is utterly bereft of anything that matters, and given the way the series ends, I can only conclude that this is intentional.   That's more confidence than I have in what I think this ending was trying for. All I can really garner is ""making the literal child whose only desire is to off himself God is not a great long-term plan.""     I mean I wouldn't go so far as to use the word ""trying,"" because everything in the last episode is insultingly lazy. It's one big ""gotcha"" for every single character and, by extension, the audience. Posturing as deep but as flimsy as a paper tiger.    Also God kills himself lol.   Ah come on, there's some really good philosophizing in here somewhere. We just have to look!     I guess when you're an effectively omnipotent being you have nothing better to do than come up with weird metaphors about fruit.     But listen. Everyone talks about the self-deicide because it's the only interesting thing about this show. We need to at least address how this ending is also total dogshit resolution for what few characters made it to the last episode. Like how Mirai and Saki manage to get MARRIED and still look dead inside doing it.      Or you've got THIS. Which honestly would be cute in a completely different series that treated both of these characters better. And that's how much I have to stretch to say something nice here.     They're the perfect couple really. She's too shallow to demand any actual emotional connection from him, but also too stupid to recognize he's constantly insulting her. It's a match made in hell! Or I guess technically a match made in the rapture.         So here's the thrust of the ending if you don't want to watch it yourself (and you don't). God killing himself causes all life on Earth to disappear, because God created life. However, God himself was created by more advanced beings, who have seeded various Gods on planets like Earth to see if they can grow a creature capable of killing them. Because those advanced beings are immortal, and they also don't know who created them, and it sucks, and they want to die. Everything sucks. Yoneda was wrong. Mirai was wrong. Nothing matters. Fuck you.     Fuck Yoneda in particular. Even in the last fleeting moments before his existence ceases across all planes, he still has to come up with a reason why he's not wrong.

News One Piece Anime Airs 1st New Episode Since Toei Hack on April 17   posted on 2022-04-06 11:36 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Episode 1,014 is 1st new episode in six weeks    The official Twitter account for the One Piece anime announced on Wednesday that the anime will continue with 1,014th episode on April 17. The episode will be the first new episode for the anime in six weeks, and the first since the the Toei Animation hack last month that also affected other productions.  (The previous new episode aired on March 6.)    The anime has been airing rerun or recap episodes since the hack, and will still air a ""Wano Country Best Selection"" recap episode this coming Sunday.    Toei Animation announced on March 11 that on March 6, an unauthorized third party accessed the company's network, which resulted in a shutdown of part of the company's systems. Toei Animation is currently investigating the matter. The hack affected the broadcast schedules for the One Piece, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai, Delicious Party Precure, and Digimon Ghost Game anime, as well as the Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero anime film.    TV Asahi was originally slated to air episode 6 of Delicious Party Precure on March 13, but due to the hack the channel aired episode 4 of the show instead. TV Asahi aired the Hugtto! Precure Futari wa Precure All Stars Memories in three parts on March 20, March 27, and April 3 instead of airing new episodes of the anime.      Fuji TV reran the first episode of Digimon Ghost Game on March 20, and the channel has since been airing more ""Digimon Ghost Game Selection"" rerun episodes after that.    TV Tokyo did not air new episodes of the Dragon Quest: Adventure of Dai anime on March 12, March 19, March 26, and April 2 due to the Toei Animation hack.    Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, the second anime film in the Dragon Ball Super franchise, was delayed indefinitely from its original April 22 opening in Japan.

Toei Animation announced on March 11 that on March 6, an unauthorized third party accessed the company's network, which resulted in a shutdown of part of the company's systems. Toei Animation is currently investigating the matter. The hack affected the broadcast schedules for the One Piece, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai, Delicious Party Precure, and Digimon Ghost Game anime, as well as the Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero anime film.    TV Asahi was originally slated to air episode 6 of Delicious Party Precure on March 13, but due to the hack the channel aired episode 4 of the show instead. TV Asahi aired the Hugtto! Precure Futari wa Precure All Stars Memories in three parts on March 20, March 27, and April 3 instead of airing new episodes of the anime.      Fuji TV reran the first episode of Digimon Ghost Game on March 20, and the channel has since been airing more ""Digimon Ghost Game Selection"" rerun episodes after that.    TV Tokyo did not air new episodes of the Dragon Quest: Adventure of Dai anime on March 12, March 19, March 26, and April 2 due to the Toei Animation hack.    Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, the second anime film in the Dragon Ball Super franchise, was delayed indefinitely from its original April 22 opening in Japan.

Fuji TV reran the first episode of Digimon Ghost Game on March 20, and the channel has since been airing more ""Digimon Ghost Game Selection"" rerun episodes after that.    TV Tokyo did not air new episodes of the Dragon Quest: Adventure of Dai anime on March 12, March 19, March 26, and April 2 due to the Toei Animation hack.    Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, the second anime film in the Dragon Ball Super franchise, was delayed indefinitely from its original April 22 opening in Japan.

The latest released dub season of Food Wars felt uninspired in both departments certainly capable of better results.

Like, who thought that was a good idea at all?            I am not gonna defend False Faces as they goofed a few things up that will need to be corrected in order to proceed with MOT.     At the same time it was not terrible,  and FF was only half of the story as everything was setting up for MOT.      I am surprised however that Sentai let Crunchyroll have this one,  considering their past attachment to the franchise.     Let's hope Crunchyroll doesn't screw up the localization like Sentai did with FF.

It's worth keeping in mind that production on The False Faces started before the game was even released in Japan, and the director hadn't played the game and intentionally changed the direction and tone of a lot of scenes.   Since Mask of Truth has been out for six years now, hopefully the anime will turn out a lot better as long as the director tries to stay faithful to it.  The biggest concern I have is just that it's a very long story -- the game is easily >50 hours -- and they're probably going to cut a lot of material unless this is a 3 or 4 cour series.

Do wonder how they'll handle the scene the anime didn't have which is actually a pretty important part.   spoiler[Where the party goes into the ruins and finds out about the slimes being what's left of humans.]   Guess they could just have it be a flashback.

The latest released dub season of Food Wars felt uninspired in both departments certainly capable of better results.

Like, who thought that was a good idea at all?            I am not gonna defend False Faces as they goofed a few things up that will need to be corrected in order to proceed with MOT.     At the same time it was not terrible,  and FF was only half of the story as everything was setting up for MOT.      I am surprised however that Sentai let Crunchyroll have this one,  considering their past attachment to the franchise.     Let's hope Crunchyroll doesn't screw up the localization like Sentai did with FF.

It's worth keeping in mind that production on The False Faces started before the game was even released in Japan, and the director hadn't played the game and intentionally changed the direction and tone of a lot of scenes.   Since Mask of Truth has been out for six years now, hopefully the anime will turn out a lot better as long as the director tries to stay faithful to it.  The biggest concern I have is just that it's a very long story -- the game is easily >50 hours -- and they're probably going to cut a lot of material unless this is a 3 or 4 cour series.

Do wonder how they'll handle the scene the anime didn't have which is actually a pretty important part.   spoiler[Where the party goes into the ruins and finds out about the slimes being what's left of humans.]   Guess they could just have it be a flashback.

It's worth keeping in mind that production on The False Faces started before the game was even released in Japan, and the director hadn't played the game and intentionally changed the direction and tone of a lot of scenes.   Since Mask of Truth has been out for six years now, hopefully the anime will turn out a lot better as long as the director tries to stay faithful to it.
