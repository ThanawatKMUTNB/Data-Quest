Police in a Pod can be interesting too.   Couple of Cockoos is from what I've heard more like KanoKari or Domestic girlfriend - a giant train crush that is fascinating too look at.

From what I've read of In the Clear Moonlit Dusk and A Sign of Affection, they are as bog-standard as they get, I really fail to see what makes them special. Yes, both have a ""twist"" on the formulas of their genre, except even those twists are old by now, and then they don't really do anything particularly interesting with them. The characters are boring and tropey, the relationships and conflicts are nothing we haven't seen before... yes, I know I'm probably not the target audience here, not being particularly enamored with the genres and tropes in question, but I really don't understand how these are any better than the million other pleasantly drawn shoujo romances that follow the exact same formulas as these and do it neither better nor worse.   Same with Nina the Starry Bride, it's like... why this one in particular? Yes, it's a pleasant manga I guess, if someone is into this genre, but what makes it more special than say, Itsuwari no Freya or Elia to totsukuni no ou or Boukoku no Marguerite (aka Princess Marguerite From The Ruined Country)? All of them do pretty much what Nina the Starry Bride does, and do it better.    Skip to Loafer is really fun though, I look forward to the anime adaptation.

Review:         Synopsis:        Mysterious, not-quite-human Orochi has fateful encounters with two different families: two sisters fated to become ugly once they turn eighteen, and a woman scarred by her difficult past who can't seem to escape tragedy. Will Orochi's powers help these people? Or is the human heart the one thing that a supernatural being like her cannot understand?     Review:            Orochi is a mysterious, clearly supernatural woman who serves as our guide through the two stories in this volume, a little bit like how Golden Age DC horror comics House of Mystery and The House of Secrets had Cain and Abel fill a similar function. But in Kazuo Umezz's variation on the theme, Orochi is a participant in the horrors, and in one case the instigator of it all, albeit an unwitting one. Interestingly there is still an anthology feel to the series, largely brought about by the fact that this volume, the first in Viz's “Perfect Edition” releases of the work, contains two separate stories. In Bones, the second, longer story, Orochi's attempt to give a woman with a miserable life the happiness she lost backfires horribly in a case of ""be careful what you wish for,"" while in the shorter Sisters Orochi finds herself living with two sisters who fear the impending loss of their beauty when they turn eighteen due to a family curse.    It's hard to say if one story is better than the other, because both are strong in their own ways. There's more of a delicious irony to Sisters that's missing from Bones, which takes a more traditional horror path, replete with gore and body horror. It might almost be worth categorizing the former as terror (psychological) and the latter as horror (visceral) for their very different storylines and approaches to the genre. The action of Sisters takes place primarily in the heads of sisters Rumi and Emi – they believe that their family suffers from a curse that makes the women turn ugly upon reaching their eighteenth birthday. Orochi stumbles into their home one rainy night, and uses her powers to convince the girls that she's their new live-in maid by simply touching her hand to their foreheads. Once in the house, Orochi quickly becomes fond of the sisters and decides that she'll stay and watch over them, our first indication that she's a more benevolent entity than the genre of the story she's in would suggest. In fact, Orochi herself has very little to do with the events that quickly begin to unfold around Emi and Rumi – she never plants an idea in their heads with her powers after the initial one to gain entry to their house. The sisters, as it turns out, are perfectly capable of destroying themselves with their fear of no longer being beautiful and their jealousy that one of them may be adopted and thus exempt from the family curse. This allows us to wonder whether the curse itself truly exists or if it's brought on by the ugly thoughts and emotions raised by the certainty that eighteen is the end date for their beauty – they believe it, and so it becomes true, one way or another. It's a statement on the obsession with youthful good looks and beauty standards, as well as how those can warp people internally, and we could read it as also being an indictment on cultures that expect or pressure their women to marry by a certain age; one of the sisters has a boyfriend who becomes tangled up in their family issues.    Bones, which is twice the length of its predecessor, warps the traditional Cinderella story, but in a slow enough way that its true nature doesn't become fully clear until the end. It follows Chie, a girl whose mother died in childbirth and whose stepmother treated her cruelly. After a terrible girlhood, Chie finally finds happiness with Saburo, only to nearly lose him in an accident. Although he recovers, he dies shortly after, and Chie is inconsolable. In this story, Orochi is working as a nurse at a local hospital, and she feels so badly for Chie and Saburo that she resolves to use her powers to bring Saburo back from the dead – and if you've ever read any horror fiction, you know that that's a spectacularly bad idea. More Those Who Seek Forgiveness (an early Laurell K. Hamilton short story from her collection Strange Candy) than The Monkey's Paw, Saburo's return quickly devolves into something more horrible than Orochiever could have imagined, even as she remains devoted to trying to fix the situation. While Sisters involves self-harm, Bones is all about the body horror, with decomposing corpses and death by either bugs or suffocation (or possibly both) on the table. It's a more complex story, but also a bit less interesting in that it lacks the ironic elements of Sisters and feels rather more traditional of its genre. Orochi's more active role in the plot is one of its best aspects, since it's less the humans who need to be careful what they're wishing for and more Orochi as she learns some hard facts about human nature, which is far more terrible than even Emi and Rumi showed her.    Both stories do a very good job of getting across the sense that Orochi (named for a mythical eight-headed, eight-tailed Japanese dragon) really does mean well – it's just that she's not human, and that makes it difficult for her to understand human nature. Her help is the worst sort of hindrance, and it's made tragic by the fact that her intentions are always, always good. With art that's easier on the eyes than Junji Ito's in that it's less likely to turn your stomach (although it is every bit as affective), this is a solid work. It may not be as visceral as some other horror manga, but it does still make its points, and Orochi herself is an excellent method of doing so. We all know that humans are usually the real monsters in the world – and nothing gets that point across than having an actual supernatural “monster” be the one to realize it.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Story : B+ Art : B+  + Solid horror and terror, Orochi as a character works to emphasize both. − Can be a little too on-the-nose at times, Bones drags a bit.            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Kazuo Umezu   Full encyclopedia details aboutOrochi (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 26th 2022       Orochi: The Perfect Edition GN 1                     Synopsis:             Mysterious, not-quite-human Orochi has fateful encounters with two different families: two sisters fated to become ugly once they turn eighteen, and a woman scarred by her difficult past who can't seem to escape tragedy. Will Orochi's powers help these people? Or is the human heart the one thing that a supernatural being like her cannot understand?      Review:         Synopsis:        Mysterious, not-quite-human Orochi has fateful encounters with two different families: two sisters fated to become ugly once they turn eighteen, and a woman scarred by her difficult past who can't seem to escape tragedy. Will Orochi's powers help these people? Or is the human heart the one thing that a supernatural being like her cannot understand?     Review:            Orochi is a mysterious, clearly supernatural woman who serves as our guide through the two stories in this volume, a little bit like how Golden Age DC horror comics House of Mystery and The House of Secrets had Cain and Abel fill a similar function. But in Kazuo Umezz's variation on the theme, Orochi is a participant in the horrors, and in one case the instigator of it all, albeit an unwitting one. Interestingly there is still an anthology feel to the series, largely brought about by the fact that this volume, the first in Viz's “Perfect Edition” releases of the work, contains two separate stories. In Bones, the second, longer story, Orochi's attempt to give a woman with a miserable life the happiness she lost backfires horribly in a case of ""be careful what you wish for,"" while in the shorter Sisters Orochi finds herself living with two sisters who fear the impending loss of their beauty when they turn eighteen due to a family curse.    It's hard to say if one story is better than the other, because both are strong in their own ways. There's more of a delicious irony to Sisters that's missing from Bones, which takes a more traditional horror path, replete with gore and body horror. It might almost be worth categorizing the former as terror (psychological) and the latter as horror (visceral) for their very different storylines and approaches to the genre. The action of Sisters takes place primarily in the heads of sisters Rumi and Emi – they believe that their family suffers from a curse that makes the women turn ugly upon reaching their eighteenth birthday. Orochi stumbles into their home one rainy night, and uses her powers to convince the girls that she's their new live-in maid by simply touching her hand to their foreheads. Once in the house, Orochi quickly becomes fond of the sisters and decides that she'll stay and watch over them, our first indication that she's a more benevolent entity than the genre of the story she's in would suggest. In fact, Orochi herself has very little to do with the events that quickly begin to unfold around Emi and Rumi – she never plants an idea in their heads with her powers after the initial one to gain entry to their house. The sisters, as it turns out, are perfectly capable of destroying themselves with their fear of no longer being beautiful and their jealousy that one of them may be adopted and thus exempt from the family curse. This allows us to wonder whether the curse itself truly exists or if it's brought on by the ugly thoughts and emotions raised by the certainty that eighteen is the end date for their beauty – they believe it, and so it becomes true, one way or another. It's a statement on the obsession with youthful good looks and beauty standards, as well as how those can warp people internally, and we could read it as also being an indictment on cultures that expect or pressure their women to marry by a certain age; one of the sisters has a boyfriend who becomes tangled up in their family issues.    Bones, which is twice the length of its predecessor, warps the traditional Cinderella story, but in a slow enough way that its true nature doesn't become fully clear until the end. It follows Chie, a girl whose mother died in childbirth and whose stepmother treated her cruelly. After a terrible girlhood, Chie finally finds happiness with Saburo, only to nearly lose him in an accident. Although he recovers, he dies shortly after, and Chie is inconsolable. In this story, Orochi is working as a nurse at a local hospital, and she feels so badly for Chie and Saburo that she resolves to use her powers to bring Saburo back from the dead – and if you've ever read any horror fiction, you know that that's a spectacularly bad idea. More Those Who Seek Forgiveness (an early Laurell K. Hamilton short story from her collection Strange Candy) than The Monkey's Paw, Saburo's return quickly devolves into something more horrible than Orochiever could have imagined, even as she remains devoted to trying to fix the situation. While Sisters involves self-harm, Bones is all about the body horror, with decomposing corpses and death by either bugs or suffocation (or possibly both) on the table. It's a more complex story, but also a bit less interesting in that it lacks the ironic elements of Sisters and feels rather more traditional of its genre. Orochi's more active role in the plot is one of its best aspects, since it's less the humans who need to be careful what they're wishing for and more Orochi as she learns some hard facts about human nature, which is far more terrible than even Emi and Rumi showed her.    Both stories do a very good job of getting across the sense that Orochi (named for a mythical eight-headed, eight-tailed Japanese dragon) really does mean well – it's just that she's not human, and that makes it difficult for her to understand human nature. Her help is the worst sort of hindrance, and it's made tragic by the fact that her intentions are always, always good. With art that's easier on the eyes than Junji Ito's in that it's less likely to turn your stomach (although it is every bit as affective), this is a solid work. It may not be as visceral as some other horror manga, but it does still make its points, and Orochi herself is an excellent method of doing so. We all know that humans are usually the real monsters in the world – and nothing gets that point across than having an actual supernatural “monster” be the one to realize it.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Story : B+ Art : B+  + Solid horror and terror, Orochi as a character works to emphasize both. − Can be a little too on-the-nose at times, Bones drags a bit.            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Kazuo Umezu   Full encyclopedia details aboutOrochi (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 26th 2022       Orochi: The Perfect Edition GN 1                     Synopsis:             Mysterious, not-quite-human Orochi has fateful encounters with two different families: two sisters fated to become ugly once they turn eighteen, and a woman scarred by her difficult past who can't seem to escape tragedy. Will Orochi's powers help these people? Or is the human heart the one thing that a supernatural being like her cannot understand?      Review:         Synopsis:        Mysterious, not-quite-human Orochi has fateful encounters with two different families: two sisters fated to become ugly once they turn eighteen, and a woman scarred by her difficult past who can't seem to escape tragedy. Will Orochi's powers help these people? Or is the human heart the one thing that a supernatural being like her cannot understand?     Review:            Orochi is a mysterious, clearly supernatural woman who serves as our guide through the two stories in this volume, a little bit like how Golden Age DC horror comics House of Mystery and The House of Secrets had Cain and Abel fill a similar function. But in Kazuo Umezz's variation on the theme, Orochi is a participant in the horrors, and in one case the instigator of it all, albeit an unwitting one. Interestingly there is still an anthology feel to the series, largely brought about by the fact that this volume, the first in Viz's “Perfect Edition” releases of the work, contains two separate stories. In Bones, the second, longer story, Orochi's attempt to give a woman with a miserable life the happiness she lost backfires horribly in a case of ""be careful what you wish for,"" while in the shorter Sisters Orochi finds herself living with two sisters who fear the impending loss of their beauty when they turn eighteen due to a family curse.    It's hard to say if one story is better than the other, because both are strong in their own ways. There's more of a delicious irony to Sisters that's missing from Bones, which takes a more traditional horror path, replete with gore and body horror. It might almost be worth categorizing the former as terror (psychological) and the latter as horror (visceral) for their very different storylines and approaches to the genre. The action of Sisters takes place primarily in the heads of sisters Rumi and Emi – they believe that their family suffers from a curse that makes the women turn ugly upon reaching their eighteenth birthday. Orochi stumbles into their home one rainy night, and uses her powers to convince the girls that she's their new live-in maid by simply touching her hand to their foreheads. Once in the house, Orochi quickly becomes fond of the sisters and decides that she'll stay and watch over them, our first indication that she's a more benevolent entity than the genre of the story she's in would suggest. In fact, Orochi herself has very little to do with the events that quickly begin to unfold around Emi and Rumi – she never plants an idea in their heads with her powers after the initial one to gain entry to their house. The sisters, as it turns out, are perfectly capable of destroying themselves with their fear of no longer being beautiful and their jealousy that one of them may be adopted and thus exempt from the family curse. This allows us to wonder whether the curse itself truly exists or if it's brought on by the ugly thoughts and emotions raised by the certainty that eighteen is the end date for their beauty – they believe it, and so it becomes true, one way or another. It's a statement on the obsession with youthful good looks and beauty standards, as well as how those can warp people internally, and we could read it as also being an indictment on cultures that expect or pressure their women to marry by a certain age; one of the sisters has a boyfriend who becomes tangled up in their family issues.    Bones, which is twice the length of its predecessor, warps the traditional Cinderella story, but in a slow enough way that its true nature doesn't become fully clear until the end. It follows Chie, a girl whose mother died in childbirth and whose stepmother treated her cruelly. After a terrible girlhood, Chie finally finds happiness with Saburo, only to nearly lose him in an accident. Although he recovers, he dies shortly after, and Chie is inconsolable. In this story, Orochi is working as a nurse at a local hospital, and she feels so badly for Chie and Saburo that she resolves to use her powers to bring Saburo back from the dead – and if you've ever read any horror fiction, you know that that's a spectacularly bad idea. More Those Who Seek Forgiveness (an early Laurell K. Hamilton short story from her collection Strange Candy) than The Monkey's Paw, Saburo's return quickly devolves into something more horrible than Orochiever could have imagined, even as she remains devoted to trying to fix the situation. While Sisters involves self-harm, Bones is all about the body horror, with decomposing corpses and death by either bugs or suffocation (or possibly both) on the table. It's a more complex story, but also a bit less interesting in that it lacks the ironic elements of Sisters and feels rather more traditional of its genre. Orochi's more active role in the plot is one of its best aspects, since it's less the humans who need to be careful what they're wishing for and more Orochi as she learns some hard facts about human nature, which is far more terrible than even Emi and Rumi showed her.    Both stories do a very good job of getting across the sense that Orochi (named for a mythical eight-headed, eight-tailed Japanese dragon) really does mean well – it's just that she's not human, and that makes it difficult for her to understand human nature. Her help is the worst sort of hindrance, and it's made tragic by the fact that her intentions are always, always good. With art that's easier on the eyes than Junji Ito's in that it's less likely to turn your stomach (although it is every bit as affective), this is a solid work. It may not be as visceral as some other horror manga, but it does still make its points, and Orochi herself is an excellent method of doing so. We all know that humans are usually the real monsters in the world – and nothing gets that point across than having an actual supernatural “monster” be the one to realize it.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Story : B+ Art : B+  + Solid horror and terror, Orochi as a character works to emphasize both. − Can be a little too on-the-nose at times, Bones drags a bit.            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Kazuo Umezu   Full encyclopedia details aboutOrochi (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

News Live-Action Koi ni Mudaguchi Series Unveils Visual, More Cast   posted on 2022-04-08 02:30 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Ryūhei Ueshima, Takigawa Akapen, Mone Akitani join cast; Banjou Ginga narrates    The official website for the live-action series of Ryoko Fukuyama's Koi ni Mudaguchi (Chatter About Love) manga revealed the visual and additional cast for the series on Thursday.     Veteran voice actor Banjou Ginga will narrate the series. Comedian Ryūhei Ueshima, Takigawa Akapen, and Mone Akitani are also joining the cast. Ueshima plays an original character named Morimi, a school janitor who always watches over the four boys from afar. Akapen plays Terakado, the butler of Maya, one of the boys who always wants to solve their problems by throwing money at it. Akitani plays Nakamura, the manga club president, and Ema's confidante that always gives her accurate advice.    The show will star So Okuno, Rintaro Mizusawa, Eito Konishi, and Maito Fujioka as Nishina, Maya, Shiro, and Aoi, respectively. The additional cast members include Yui Oguri as Ema, Rio Teramoto as Meri, Noa Tsurushima as Reika Tsunde, and Rinka Ōtani as Amane.    Natsu Hashimoto, Tomohiro Ōtoshi, and Ruri Hyōdō are writing the scripts, and Junta Yamaguchi, Ayuta Yoshikawa, and Miyako Yasojima are directing the series. KANA-BOON will perform the theme song ""Merry Go Round."" The series will premiere on TV Asahi on April 16, and on ABC TV on April 17. The show will stream on TELASA, TVer, and GYAO! in Japan.    Fukuyama launched the manga in Hakusensha's Hana to Yume magazine in September 2019. Hakusensha published the seventh volume on March 18.    The romantic comedy manga centers on four foolish young men who are wasting their youths. The four young men have only their good looks going for them, and they enroll in a school that used to be an all-girls school. They start a club called the ""Preserving Intangible Cultural Heritage"" club, but its nickname is the ""Pointless Club."" Every day at the club they just sit around idly talking about trivial matters.    Fukuyama launched the Anonymous Noise manga in Hana to Yume in April 2013, and ended the series in January 2019. Viz Media has released the manga in English.    A 12-episode television anime adaptation of the manga premiered in Japan in April 2017. Sentai Filmworks licensed the anime and streamed it on Amazon's now-defunct Anime Strike service in the United States. Crunchyroll streamed the series outside of the United States. Sentai Filmworks released the series on home video with an English dub in June 2018, and HIDIVE began streaming the show's English dub in the same month.    A live-action film adaptation of the manga premiered in Japan in November 2017.    Fukyama also launched the Kikenai Yoru wa Nai (The Unhearing Nights are Dead) manga in Young Animal Zero in September 2019, and the series is ongoing.

News Live-Action Koi ni Mudaguchi Series Unveils Visual, More Cast   posted on 2022-04-08 02:30 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Ryūhei Ueshima, Takigawa Akapen, Mone Akitani join cast; Banjou Ginga narrates    The official website for the live-action series of Ryoko Fukuyama's Koi ni Mudaguchi (Chatter About Love) manga revealed the visual and additional cast for the series on Thursday.     Veteran voice actor Banjou Ginga will narrate the series. Comedian Ryūhei Ueshima, Takigawa Akapen, and Mone Akitani are also joining the cast. Ueshima plays an original character named Morimi, a school janitor who always watches over the four boys from afar. Akapen plays Terakado, the butler of Maya, one of the boys who always wants to solve their problems by throwing money at it. Akitani plays Nakamura, the manga club president, and Ema's confidante that always gives her accurate advice.    The show will star So Okuno, Rintaro Mizusawa, Eito Konishi, and Maito Fujioka as Nishina, Maya, Shiro, and Aoi, respectively. The additional cast members include Yui Oguri as Ema, Rio Teramoto as Meri, Noa Tsurushima as Reika Tsunde, and Rinka Ōtani as Amane.    Natsu Hashimoto, Tomohiro Ōtoshi, and Ruri Hyōdō are writing the scripts, and Junta Yamaguchi, Ayuta Yoshikawa, and Miyako Yasojima are directing the series. KANA-BOON will perform the theme song ""Merry Go Round."" The series will premiere on TV Asahi on April 16, and on ABC TV on April 17. The show will stream on TELASA, TVer, and GYAO! in Japan.    Fukuyama launched the manga in Hakusensha's Hana to Yume magazine in September 2019. Hakusensha published the seventh volume on March 18.    The romantic comedy manga centers on four foolish young men who are wasting their youths. The four young men have only their good looks going for them, and they enroll in a school that used to be an all-girls school. They start a club called the ""Preserving Intangible Cultural Heritage"" club, but its nickname is the ""Pointless Club."" Every day at the club they just sit around idly talking about trivial matters.    Fukuyama launched the Anonymous Noise manga in Hana to Yume in April 2013, and ended the series in January 2019. Viz Media has released the manga in English.    A 12-episode television anime adaptation of the manga premiered in Japan in April 2017. Sentai Filmworks licensed the anime and streamed it on Amazon's now-defunct Anime Strike service in the United States. Crunchyroll streamed the series outside of the United States. Sentai Filmworks released the series on home video with an English dub in June 2018, and HIDIVE began streaming the show's English dub in the same month.    A live-action film adaptation of the manga premiered in Japan in November 2017.    Fukyama also launched the Kikenai Yoru wa Nai (The Unhearing Nights are Dead) manga in Young Animal Zero in September 2019, and the series is ongoing.

News Live-Action Koi ni Mudaguchi Series Unveils Visual, More Cast   posted on 2022-04-08 02:30 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Ryūhei Ueshima, Takigawa Akapen, Mone Akitani join cast; Banjou Ginga narrates    The official website for the live-action series of Ryoko Fukuyama's Koi ni Mudaguchi (Chatter About Love) manga revealed the visual and additional cast for the series on Thursday.     Veteran voice actor Banjou Ginga will narrate the series. Comedian Ryūhei Ueshima, Takigawa Akapen, and Mone Akitani are also joining the cast. Ueshima plays an original character named Morimi, a school janitor who always watches over the four boys from afar. Akapen plays Terakado, the butler of Maya, one of the boys who always wants to solve their problems by throwing money at it. Akitani plays Nakamura, the manga club president, and Ema's confidante that always gives her accurate advice.    The show will star So Okuno, Rintaro Mizusawa, Eito Konishi, and Maito Fujioka as Nishina, Maya, Shiro, and Aoi, respectively. The additional cast members include Yui Oguri as Ema, Rio Teramoto as Meri, Noa Tsurushima as Reika Tsunde, and Rinka Ōtani as Amane.    Natsu Hashimoto, Tomohiro Ōtoshi, and Ruri Hyōdō are writing the scripts, and Junta Yamaguchi, Ayuta Yoshikawa, and Miyako Yasojima are directing the series. KANA-BOON will perform the theme song ""Merry Go Round."" The series will premiere on TV Asahi on April 16, and on ABC TV on April 17. The show will stream on TELASA, TVer, and GYAO! in Japan.    Fukuyama launched the manga in Hakusensha's Hana to Yume magazine in September 2019. Hakusensha published the seventh volume on March 18.    The romantic comedy manga centers on four foolish young men who are wasting their youths. The four young men have only their good looks going for them, and they enroll in a school that used to be an all-girls school. They start a club called the ""Preserving Intangible Cultural Heritage"" club, but its nickname is the ""Pointless Club."" Every day at the club they just sit around idly talking about trivial matters.    Fukuyama launched the Anonymous Noise manga in Hana to Yume in April 2013, and ended the series in January 2019. Viz Media has released the manga in English.    A 12-episode television anime adaptation of the manga premiered in Japan in April 2017. Sentai Filmworks licensed the anime and streamed it on Amazon's now-defunct Anime Strike service in the United States. Crunchyroll streamed the series outside of the United States. Sentai Filmworks released the series on home video with an English dub in June 2018, and HIDIVE began streaming the show's English dub in the same month.    A live-action film adaptation of the manga premiered in Japan in November 2017.    Fukyama also launched the Kikenai Yoru wa Nai (The Unhearing Nights are Dead) manga in Young Animal Zero in September 2019, and the series is ongoing.

Sabikui Bisco Episode 12  by Steve Jones, Mar 29th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Sabikui Bisco ?                     Community score: 4.3           After last week's stunner, there aren't a whole lot of surprises left in Sabikui Bisco's bag of tricks, but it doesn't need them to pull together a satisfying and highly fungal finale. In fact, it's a credit to the story's construction that all of this feels as natural as it does. It's an over-the-top capstone on a drawn out and action heavy kaiju assualt, yet it hits the right character beats and ties a neat bow on this season's most important threads. And at this point, all Sabikui Bisco really needed to do was not trip over itself in order to wrap up a solid adaptation, so it can consider itself as steady as bedrock.    To my chagrin, Bisco's messianic return does indeed receive an explanation, but at least it jives with the rest of the setting. If I've already accepted that spore-coated arrows can spontaneously generate skyscraper-sized caps, then it only takes a light mental jog to accept that pipe snake poison can turn you into an immortal mushroom man. What's most important is that it's very gross. Bisco remarks that he has to clean Rust Eater growths off himself regularly, and he's in a hurry to find a cure for this unwanted boon of immortality, which is very in-character for him. I had been wondering where the story could go from here now that one of its heroes is apparently unkillable, and this makes a lot of sense.    Even with Bisco's miraculous mycelium, however, it still takes all hands to take down Kurokawa's yucky rust-spewing colossus. Personally, I wouldn't have dragged this confrontation out over three weeks, and I think the story's pacing would have been better served by frontloading at least one more episodic travelogue to better acquaint ourselves with both our heroes and the oddness of this world. Nonetheless, this conclusion has a collection of small and large moments I like a lot. Tirol frantically flipping through the Tetsujin user manual is a fitting gag for her mental acumen and total lack of combat prowess. Milo and Bisco naturally get the finishing blow with their bro-and-arrow combo, fitting their bodies together to send one final Rust Eater payload through Kurokawa's cranium.    Pawoo definitely steals the show, though. I continue to find it funny the narrative seems so adamant on setting her, not her brother, up with Bisco—whether this is due to prejudice, cowardice, or some other factor, I couldn't say. But if it's going to do so, then at least it's doing so with plenty of aplomb. Never mind that she gets the best action setpiece in this episode, rocketing herself up close and personal into the Tetsujin's massive mug and using her much vaunted pole to cleave his mask in twain. She Frenches Bisco and then nonchalantly brags about tasting the tongue of a walking deity. That is pure action hero badass behavior. At the end of the day, I'm still team Milo, but Pawoo is too good a character to be upset with.    And Milo and Bisco do bless us with the finale's tenderest moment after the battle is won. Yeah, Pawoo got to play tonsil hockey with him, but it's Milo who snuggles up against Bisco's chiseled chest to listen to the steadiness of his hyphae-enhanced heartbeat. At no point in the episode is there ever a doubt that they'll do everything together, from kicking Kurokawa's big rusty ass, to searching for a cure for immortality, to spreading the good shroom news (and spores) to Japan's other prefectures. Despite all the melodrama of the season's second half, they're back to bickering like an old couple in no time. It's pleasant! And that honestly might be the best word for Sabikui Bisco. It might make a lot of waves with its weird ideas and outrageous presentation, but overall it's just a very pleasant, crowd-pleasing watch that does right by its source material.    As my last word on Sabikui Bisco as an adaptation and anime, I really want to note how impressive and consistent it was on the production level. I think I may have voiced my quibbles a little too much in these reviews, but that's only because the show was operating on a level where I could assess the animation and feel okay about it. Because, as a whole, the show looks great! It emphasized personality-rich character art and backgrounds throughout its run, and it was able to inject kinetic energy where it counted. This finale, for instance, has some really nice cuts. Consider the fallen Tetsujin sloughing off its rust body, or Pawoo slamming her sword into the giant mask. It's even more impressive considering this is Studio OZ's first main credit, although director Atsushi Ikariya is no neophyte, and the team appear closely entwined with the older and similarly named Studio NAZ. This tally of animators and animation directors suggests a highly concentrated core staff, and the results speak for themselves.    The season bookends itself with the border outpost, which both serves as a nice way to send off those characters, and serves as a piece of narrative punctuation suggesting the further adventures to come. While Imihama is sorted now that it has Rust Eater aplenty and a governor who's not a total psychopath, the rest of Japan isn't as enthused about Milo and Bisco's fungal proselytization. The societal rot that let Kurokawa flourish is still out there, and they need to cure it with their own brand of good natural rot. I will most certainly be game to pop more shrooms should we ever be blessed with more Bisco, but with its creative vision and focus on adapting just one volume, this season does an admirable job standing alone as one of winter's most enjoyable action anime.

Sabikui Bisco Episode 12  by Steve Jones, Mar 29th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Sabikui Bisco ?                     Community score: 4.3           After last week's stunner, there aren't a whole lot of surprises left in Sabikui Bisco's bag of tricks, but it doesn't need them to pull together a satisfying and highly fungal finale. In fact, it's a credit to the story's construction that all of this feels as natural as it does. It's an over-the-top capstone on a drawn out and action heavy kaiju assualt, yet it hits the right character beats and ties a neat bow on this season's most important threads. And at this point, all Sabikui Bisco really needed to do was not trip over itself in order to wrap up a solid adaptation, so it can consider itself as steady as bedrock.    To my chagrin, Bisco's messianic return does indeed receive an explanation, but at least it jives with the rest of the setting. If I've already accepted that spore-coated arrows can spontaneously generate skyscraper-sized caps, then it only takes a light mental jog to accept that pipe snake poison can turn you into an immortal mushroom man. What's most important is that it's very gross. Bisco remarks that he has to clean Rust Eater growths off himself regularly, and he's in a hurry to find a cure for this unwanted boon of immortality, which is very in-character for him. I had been wondering where the story could go from here now that one of its heroes is apparently unkillable, and this makes a lot of sense.    Even with Bisco's miraculous mycelium, however, it still takes all hands to take down Kurokawa's yucky rust-spewing colossus. Personally, I wouldn't have dragged this confrontation out over three weeks, and I think the story's pacing would have been better served by frontloading at least one more episodic travelogue to better acquaint ourselves with both our heroes and the oddness of this world. Nonetheless, this conclusion has a collection of small and large moments I like a lot. Tirol frantically flipping through the Tetsujin user manual is a fitting gag for her mental acumen and total lack of combat prowess. Milo and Bisco naturally get the finishing blow with their bro-and-arrow combo, fitting their bodies together to send one final Rust Eater payload through Kurokawa's cranium.    Pawoo definitely steals the show, though. I continue to find it funny the narrative seems so adamant on setting her, not her brother, up with Bisco—whether this is due to prejudice, cowardice, or some other factor, I couldn't say. But if it's going to do so, then at least it's doing so with plenty of aplomb. Never mind that she gets the best action setpiece in this episode, rocketing herself up close and personal into the Tetsujin's massive mug and using her much vaunted pole to cleave his mask in twain. She Frenches Bisco and then nonchalantly brags about tasting the tongue of a walking deity. That is pure action hero badass behavior. At the end of the day, I'm still team Milo, but Pawoo is too good a character to be upset with.    And Milo and Bisco do bless us with the finale's tenderest moment after the battle is won. Yeah, Pawoo got to play tonsil hockey with him, but it's Milo who snuggles up against Bisco's chiseled chest to listen to the steadiness of his hyphae-enhanced heartbeat. At no point in the episode is there ever a doubt that they'll do everything together, from kicking Kurokawa's big rusty ass, to searching for a cure for immortality, to spreading the good shroom news (and spores) to Japan's other prefectures. Despite all the melodrama of the season's second half, they're back to bickering like an old couple in no time. It's pleasant! And that honestly might be the best word for Sabikui Bisco. It might make a lot of waves with its weird ideas and outrageous presentation, but overall it's just a very pleasant, crowd-pleasing watch that does right by its source material.    As my last word on Sabikui Bisco as an adaptation and anime, I really want to note how impressive and consistent it was on the production level. I think I may have voiced my quibbles a little too much in these reviews, but that's only because the show was operating on a level where I could assess the animation and feel okay about it. Because, as a whole, the show looks great! It emphasized personality-rich character art and backgrounds throughout its run, and it was able to inject kinetic energy where it counted. This finale, for instance, has some really nice cuts. Consider the fallen Tetsujin sloughing off its rust body, or Pawoo slamming her sword into the giant mask. It's even more impressive considering this is Studio OZ's first main credit, although director Atsushi Ikariya is no neophyte, and the team appear closely entwined with the older and similarly named Studio NAZ. This tally of animators and animation directors suggests a highly concentrated core staff, and the results speak for themselves.    The season bookends itself with the border outpost, which both serves as a nice way to send off those characters, and serves as a piece of narrative punctuation suggesting the further adventures to come. While Imihama is sorted now that it has Rust Eater aplenty and a governor who's not a total psychopath, the rest of Japan isn't as enthused about Milo and Bisco's fungal proselytization. The societal rot that let Kurokawa flourish is still out there, and they need to cure it with their own brand of good natural rot. I will most certainly be game to pop more shrooms should we ever be blessed with more Bisco, but with its creative vision and focus on adapting just one volume, this season does an admirable job standing alone as one of winter's most enjoyable action anime.    Rating:                 Sabikui Bisco is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.    Steve can be found on Twitter if you want to read his World’s End Harem livetweets.

Sabikui Bisco Episode 12  by Steve Jones, Mar 29th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Sabikui Bisco ?                     Community score: 4.3           After last week's stunner, there aren't a whole lot of surprises left in Sabikui Bisco's bag of tricks, but it doesn't need them to pull together a satisfying and highly fungal finale. In fact, it's a credit to the story's construction that all of this feels as natural as it does. It's an over-the-top capstone on a drawn out and action heavy kaiju assualt, yet it hits the right character beats and ties a neat bow on this season's most important threads. And at this point, all Sabikui Bisco really needed to do was not trip over itself in order to wrap up a solid adaptation, so it can consider itself as steady as bedrock.    To my chagrin, Bisco's messianic return does indeed receive an explanation, but at least it jives with the rest of the setting. If I've already accepted that spore-coated arrows can spontaneously generate skyscraper-sized caps, then it only takes a light mental jog to accept that pipe snake poison can turn you into an immortal mushroom man. What's most important is that it's very gross. Bisco remarks that he has to clean Rust Eater growths off himself regularly, and he's in a hurry to find a cure for this unwanted boon of immortality, which is very in-character for him. I had been wondering where the story could go from here now that one of its heroes is apparently unkillable, and this makes a lot of sense.    Even with Bisco's miraculous mycelium, however, it still takes all hands to take down Kurokawa's yucky rust-spewing colossus. Personally, I wouldn't have dragged this confrontation out over three weeks, and I think the story's pacing would have been better served by frontloading at least one more episodic travelogue to better acquaint ourselves with both our heroes and the oddness of this world. Nonetheless, this conclusion has a collection of small and large moments I like a lot. Tirol frantically flipping through the Tetsujin user manual is a fitting gag for her mental acumen and total lack of combat prowess. Milo and Bisco naturally get the finishing blow with their bro-and-arrow combo, fitting their bodies together to send one final Rust Eater payload through Kurokawa's cranium.    Pawoo definitely steals the show, though. I continue to find it funny the narrative seems so adamant on setting her, not her brother, up with Bisco—whether this is due to prejudice, cowardice, or some other factor, I couldn't say. But if it's going to do so, then at least it's doing so with plenty of aplomb. Never mind that she gets the best action setpiece in this episode, rocketing herself up close and personal into the Tetsujin's massive mug and using her much vaunted pole to cleave his mask in twain. She Frenches Bisco and then nonchalantly brags about tasting the tongue of a walking deity. That is pure action hero badass behavior. At the end of the day, I'm still team Milo, but Pawoo is too good a character to be upset with.    And Milo and Bisco do bless us with the finale's tenderest moment after the battle is won. Yeah, Pawoo got to play tonsil hockey with him, but it's Milo who snuggles up against Bisco's chiseled chest to listen to the steadiness of his hyphae-enhanced heartbeat. At no point in the episode is there ever a doubt that they'll do everything together, from kicking Kurokawa's big rusty ass, to searching for a cure for immortality, to spreading the good shroom news (and spores) to Japan's other prefectures. Despite all the melodrama of the season's second half, they're back to bickering like an old couple in no time. It's pleasant! And that honestly might be the best word for Sabikui Bisco. It might make a lot of waves with its weird ideas and outrageous presentation, but overall it's just a very pleasant, crowd-pleasing watch that does right by its source material.    As my last word on Sabikui Bisco as an adaptation and anime, I really want to note how impressive and consistent it was on the production level. I think I may have voiced my quibbles a little too much in these reviews, but that's only because the show was operating on a level where I could assess the animation and feel okay about it. Because, as a whole, the show looks great! It emphasized personality-rich character art and backgrounds throughout its run, and it was able to inject kinetic energy where it counted. This finale, for instance, has some really nice cuts. Consider the fallen Tetsujin sloughing off its rust body, or Pawoo slamming her sword into the giant mask. It's even more impressive considering this is Studio OZ's first main credit, although director Atsushi Ikariya is no neophyte, and the team appear closely entwined with the older and similarly named Studio NAZ. This tally of animators and animation directors suggests a highly concentrated core staff, and the results speak for themselves.    The season bookends itself with the border outpost, which both serves as a nice way to send off those characters, and serves as a piece of narrative punctuation suggesting the further adventures to come. While Imihama is sorted now that it has Rust Eater aplenty and a governor who's not a total psychopath, the rest of Japan isn't as enthused about Milo and Bisco's fungal proselytization. The societal rot that let Kurokawa flourish is still out there, and they need to cure it with their own brand of good natural rot. I will most certainly be game to pop more shrooms should we ever be blessed with more Bisco, but with its creative vision and focus on adapting just one volume, this season does an admirable job standing alone as one of winter's most enjoyable action anime.    Rating:                 Sabikui Bisco is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.    Steve can be found on Twitter if you want to read his World’s End Harem livetweets. Otherwise, catch him chatting about trash and treasure alike on This Week in Anime.  <prevEpisodes 1-2 Episode 3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episode 6 Episode 7 Episode 8 Episode 9 Episode 10 Episode 11 Episode 12     discuss this in the forum (51 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to Sabikui Bisco Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken."" Another literally c...                    game review          7 comments       Danganronpa Decadence   Nov 30, 02:00 7 comments                 games    Danganronpa Decadence offers a bit of new content, gameplay, and interactions between cast members, but this little something extra hardly feels decadent. ― Over ten years ago, the first Danganronpa game came out on the PlayStation Portable. Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. The game acts as an accelerat...                    game review          2 comments       Mary Skelter Finale   Oct 13, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Mary Skelter Finale's twistedly imaginative imagery are sure to sit with any player long after they've put it down. ― Of all the JRPG/visual novel hybrids I've had a chance to play, Mary Skelter Finale is by far the most memorable of the considerably homogenous bunch. Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork. Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally. Additionally, many ...                    game review          9 comments       Death end re;Quest   Jul  6, 03:00 9 comments                 games    Death end proves me dead wrong: it demonstrates not only Idea Factory's ability to put out quality titles, but that they can also be trusted to take real creative risks and create unique games – something all too rare in today's market. ― I wasn't expecting much from Death end re;Quest when I first picked it up.

However, despite this, it is not a direct sequel to the previous game, Fate...                    game review          8 comments       REVIEW: Steins;Gate Elite   2019 Mar  8, 01:00 8 comments                 games    This remastered version of the sci fi visual novel classic is finally available with new footage and features for fans to discover all over again. James Beckett finds out if this revamped game is worth a look for S;G fans. ― Despite its foibles, I still consider the Steins;Gate anime to be a solid science-fiction romp, and I've long meant to double back and play the original 2009 visual novel on whic...                    game review          20 comments       Kingdom Hearts III   2019 Feb  7, 03:00 20 comments                 games    Sora's long journey with his many Disney friends comes to a close in this long-awaited final chapter of the trilogy. Callum May has our full review of this highly anticipated RPG. ― Your impressions of Kingdom Hearts III are almost entirely shaped by how much experience you've had with the series thus far. Or how you felt about each entry. Zipping around Disney, Pixar and original Kingdom Hearts worl...                    game review          13 comments       Tales of Vesperia Definitive Edition   2019 Feb  6, 04:07 13 comments                 games    One of the most beloved Tales RPGs is finally available in HD on the Nintendo Switch. Dave Riley finds out how this classic has held up over ten years later. ― It took ten years, and one legendarily dismissive tweet, but we finally got it. Originally released on Xbox as part of Microsoft's push for a Japanese audience, Tales of Vesperia's updated and expanded PS3 version was a Japan-only release, bar...                    game review          14 comments       REVIEW: Super Smash Bros.

Branden Johnson finds out if this edition really lives up to all the hype. ― The level of excitement in the Smash Bros. fan community has probably never been higher. For all intents and purposes, this is the game. The one that has everything we could possibly want (okay, except for Waluigi)....                    game review          26 comments       Pokémon: Let's Go!   2018 Nov 21, 02:15 26 comments                 games    Pokémon fans can explore the Kanto region like never before in this high-def remake of the classic Yellow Version, but has Generation 1 aged gracefully? Branden Johnson finds out. ― I missed the Pokemon train entirely the first time around. It's strange; I love JRPGs, and I was the perfect age when Pokemon Red and Blue hit the Gameboy in the 90s. Whatever the reasons, I haven't played a single Pokemo...                    game review          2 comments       SNK 40th Anniversary Collection   2018 Nov 16, 02:22 2 comments                 games    SNK delivers a history lesson with an anthology of early arcade and NES titles. Todd finds out how well these games have held up in this new game for the Switch. ― What made SNK a cult favorite game company? Was it the Neo Geo, which delivered arcade-perfect games at home for just two hundred dollars per cartridge? Was it the Neo Geo Pocket Color, a well-made and vastly underappreciated handheld syst...                    game review          7 comments       My Hero: One's Justice (PlayStation 4)   2018 Oct 24, 23:43 7 comments                 games    My Hero One’s Justice captures the essence of its source material, and offers a fine experience for anyone looking to cross blows as their My Hero Academia favorites. ― The anime franchise tie-in brawler is a venerable gaming institution, with Bandai Namco having published similar efforts for franchises like Naruto and Dragon Ball in the past. On the other hand, One's Justice developer Byking are rel...                    game review          2 comments       Fist of the North Star: Paradise Lost   2018 Oct 12, 00:00 2 comments                 games    The classic head-exploding action of Fist of the North Star is poured into the Yakuza gameplay mold, but do these two great tastes taste great together? Daryl Surat scours the wasteland to find out. ― The last few years have marked a surge in popularity among English-language fans of both Sega's long-running Yakuza series of videogames as well as—to a lesser extent—the formative trope-establishing Sh...                    game review          7 comments       Mega Man 11   2018 Oct  2, 23:36 7 comments                 anime    It's Mega Man's big chance for a comeback, and it's not what some fans might expect. We dig into a video-game icon's return! ― Don't let the number fool you. This may be the eleventh or twelfth central Mega Man title. It may be backed by several spin-off series. Yet it's been nearly a decade since the last full-blown game in the series. Even then, Mega Man 9 and 10 were deliberate throwbacks, built t...                    game review          4 comments       Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle   2018 Sep 24, 23:00 4 comments                 games    Capcom resurrects a bunch of their classic arcade brawlers with a seven-game collection. Do they still put up a fight? ― Brawlers. Beat 'Em Ups. Belt-Scrollers. Double Dragon Clones. Punk Punching Parades. Those Arcade Games That Mom And Dad Always Said Were Too Violent For You Back in 1988. Whatever you call them, they never quite got their moment on top. True, they were staples of arcades in the la...                    game review          7 comments       Import Review: My Hero One's Justice   2018 Sep 18, 23:00 7 comments                 games    My Hero Academia arrives on consoles and PC as a fully-featured arena brawler bursting with everyone's favorite heroes, but does it go PLUS ULTRA?

Branden Johnson gets lost in the world of Monster Hunter. ― I've long aspired to be the sort of person who is into Monster Hunter. It's a real “gamer” series: brutal difficulty, complex systems, a strong community. Being a fan of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, I figured I would get into Monster Hunter, if I could...                    game review          9 comments       Review: Fate/Grand Order Arcade   2018 Aug 22, 01:14 9 comments                 games    The smash hit Fate smartphone game gets an extra-fancy new arcade edition in Japan that actually prints out physical cards for you to take home - but it doesn't come cheap! Richard Eisenbeis took the plunge, here's his report. ―  The Fate franchise is massive and sprawling. There are numerous games, TV anime, movies, novels, drama CDs, and manga. But while the franchise originally became popular duri...                    game review          2 comments       Persona 3: Dancing Moon Night & Persona 5: Dancing Star Night   2018 Aug  8, 22:00 2 comments                 games    In the wake of Persona 4's successful rhythm game, its siblings are getting in on the action!

Richard Eisenbeis has the answers in our full review. ― Following in the footsteps of 2015's Persona 4: Dancing All Night, Persona 3: Dancing Moon Night and Persona 5: Dancing Star Night are a pair of rhythm/music games that showcase the awesome soundtracks of Pe...                    game review          19 comments       Valkyria Chronicles 4   2018 Aug  6, 22:00 19 comments                 anime    Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or a newcomer, Valkyria Chronicles 4 doesn't disappoint. Richard Eisenbeis delivers his full review of the newest entry in this TRPG saga. ― The Valkyria Chronicles series is a piece of historical fiction set in a world much like our own.

Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online. Not that it was bad, just that it felt lacking compared to the two storylines that preceded it. So my expectations going into Sword Art Online: Fa...                    game review          6 comments       Ni no Kuni II:Revenant Kingdom   2018 Mar 21, 22:45 6 comments                 games    It took 8 years for a Ni no Kuni sequel to finally surface, and now that it's here, there's both good news and bad for this lavish Studio Ghibli-esque action RPG. ― Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch was a bit too traditional for me. As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase? Heidi Kemps has the answers. ― Omega Force's record with anime and manga adaptations is a bit spotty. We've had disappointments like Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage and Berserk and the Band of the Hawk, but we've also had some real win...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Dragon Ball FighterZ   2018 Jan 29, 23:00 3 comments                 games    Dustin Bailey has the full rundown on the most hotly anticipated DBZ fighting game of all time. Find out if FighterZ lives up to all the hype! ― Dragon Ball FighterZ isn't just a good game for fans of Dragon Ball—it's a great game period, a best-in-class fighter that looks great and is fun to play at any level.

Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up?

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken.""

Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork. Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally. Additionally, many ...                    game review          9 comments       Death end re;Quest   Jul  6, 03:00 9 comments                 games    Death end proves me dead wrong: it demonstrates not only Idea Factory's ability to put out quality titles, but that they can also be trusted to take real creative risks and create unique games – something all too rare in today's market. ― I wasn't expecting much from Death end re;Quest when I first picked it up.

Grant Jones revisits the franchise to see if the games still hold up to their legacy. ― The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is hard to talk about in isolation. In many ways, you need a dramatic, long-winded cut scene to get the context for the release. So if you'll indulge me, I'll try to spin the tale as bes...                    game review          15 comments       Capcom Arcade Stadium   Jun  7, 00:00 15 comments                 games    Video game archives and collections of this nature are all about making sure these newer generations of gamers get a chance to experience those which laid the groundwork for the stuff that we have today in an easy-to-digest package. ― Judging collections like this is always a bit tricky because we're not reviewing a brand new game made specifically for the current generation; rather, we're technicall...                    game review          1 comment       Famicom Detective Club: The Two-Case Collection   Jun  5, 00:00 1 comment                 games    Both stories have some arbitrary info blocks like this, but even with my sus sense tingling, neither case went exactly where I expected it to go. ― This visual novel double-pack was released for English-speaking audiences for the first time on May 14, offering a shiny remake of Satoru Okada and Yoshio Sakamoto's adventure games for Nintendo.

It's a modern-day port of an older Shin Megami Tensei game that was still experimenting with 3D movement and presentation (those have mostly stuck to the Persona games while later SMTs went back to ...                    game review          4 comments       Resident Evil Village   May 19, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It has been three years since the events of the last game and our favorite, perfectly normal everyman Ethan Winters is trying to live a normal life with his wife and newly born daughter Rose.

If you've played many of the Yakuza titles and are interested in seeing how it all comes together, I can't recommend this game enough. ― Most Japanese RPGs are wildly fantastical and cartoonish in their setting, but attempt to stay grounded through relatable character writing and conflict.

If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online. Not that it was bad, just that it felt lacking compared to the two storylines that preceded it. So my expectations going into Sword Art Online: Fa...                    game review          6 comments       Ni no Kuni II:Revenant Kingdom   2018 Mar 21, 22:45 6 comments                 games    It took 8 years for a Ni no Kuni sequel to finally surface, and now that it's here, there's both good news and bad for this lavish Studio Ghibli-esque action RPG. ― Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch was a bit too traditional for me. As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase? Heidi Kemps has the answers. ― Omega Force's record with anime and manga adaptations is a bit spotty. We've had disappointments like Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage and Berserk and the Band of the Hawk, but we've also had some real win...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Dragon Ball FighterZ   2018 Jan 29, 23:00 3 comments                 games    Dustin Bailey has the full rundown on the most hotly anticipated DBZ fighting game of all time. Find out if FighterZ lives up to all the hype! ― Dragon Ball FighterZ isn't just a good game for fans of Dragon Ball—it's a great game period, a best-in-class fighter that looks great and is fun to play at any level. That it's crafted with loving reverence to one of the most popular anime on the planet is ...                    game review          4 comments       River City: Rival Showdown   2017 Dec 20, 23:03 4 comments                 games    The open-world gameplay of this breezy beat-em-up returns on the Nintendo 3DS. Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up? Dave Riley finds out. ― With the release of a new console, the Switch, comes the expected glut of HD ports, and Resident Evil Revelations, which has been ported to on average a console and a half per year since its original release on the 3DS in 2012, is...                    game review          10 comments       Etrian Odyssey V: Beyond the Myth   2017 Oct 21, 22:00 10 comments                 games    Does the newest entry in this difficult RPG series still hurt good enough to be worth the challenge? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream. Todd Ciolek has the lowdown on every title in this collection. ― Last year's NES Classic Edition was a finely crafted piece of nostalgia: an authentically miniature Nintendo Entertainment System with thirty built-in games, ranging from enduring classics to dispo...                    game review          25 comments       Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite   2017 Sep 27, 00:00 25 comments                 games    Several changes have been made to this fighting game's new installment, but not all of them are for the better. Dustin Bailey gets into it. ― The new story mode in Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite has all the characters trapped in a pair of worlds awkwardly smashed together out of pieces from their respective universes. Marvel's AIM laboratories host not only MODOK, but also the BOWs of Resident Evil, smu...

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken."" Another literally c...                    game review          7 comments       Danganronpa Decadence   Nov 30, 02:00 7 comments                 games    Danganronpa Decadence offers a bit of new content, gameplay, and interactions between cast members, but this little something extra hardly feels decadent. ― Over ten years ago, the first Danganronpa game came out on the PlayStation Portable. Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Branden Johnson finds out. ― I missed the Pokemon train entirely the first time around. It's strange; I love JRPGs, and I was the perfect age when Pokemon Red and Blue hit the Gameboy in the 90s.

We dig into a video-game icon's return! ― Don't let the number fool you. This may be the eleventh or twelfth central Mega Man title. It may be backed by several spin-off series. Yet it's been nearly a decade since the last full-blown game in the series. Even then, Mega Man 9 and 10 were deliberate throwbacks, built t...                    game review          4 comments       Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle   2018 Sep 24, 23:00 4 comments                 games    Capcom resurrects a bunch of their classic arcade brawlers with a seven-game collection.

Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online.

As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase? Heidi Kemps has the answers. ― Omega Force's record with anime and manga adaptations is a bit spotty.

Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up?

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school.

Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken."" Another literally c...                    game review          7 comments       Danganronpa Decadence   Nov 30, 02:00 7 comments                 games    Danganronpa Decadence offers a bit of new content, gameplay, and interactions between cast members, but this little something extra hardly feels decadent. ― Over ten years ago, the first Danganronpa game came out on the PlayStation Portable. Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork. Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally. Additionally, many ...                    game review          9 comments       Death end re;Quest   Jul  6, 03:00 9 comments                 games    Death end proves me dead wrong: it demonstrates not only Idea Factory's ability to put out quality titles, but that they can also be trusted to take real creative risks and create unique games – something all too rare in today's market. ― I wasn't expecting much from Death end re;Quest when I first picked it up. It's a product of Compile Heart, which is itself a subsidiary of Idea Factory – a studio ...                    game review          5 comments       No More Heroes 1 & 2   Jun 30, 00:00 5 comments                 games    The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games. ― The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games.

Grant Jones revisits the franchise to see if the games still hold up to their legacy. ― The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is hard to talk about in isolation. In many ways, you need a dramatic, long-winded cut scene to get the context for the release. So if you'll indulge me, I'll try to spin the tale as bes...                    game review          15 comments       Capcom Arcade Stadium   Jun  7, 00:00 15 comments                 games    Video game archives and collections of this nature are all about making sure these newer generations of gamers get a chance to experience those which laid the groundwork for the stuff that we have today in an easy-to-digest package. ― Judging collections like this is always a bit tricky because we're not reviewing a brand new game made specifically for the current generation; rather, we're technicall...                    game review          1 comment       Famicom Detective Club: The Two-Case Collection   Jun  5, 00:00 1 comment                 games    Both stories have some arbitrary info blocks like this, but even with my sus sense tingling, neither case went exactly where I expected it to go. ― This visual novel double-pack was released for English-speaking audiences for the first time on May 14, offering a shiny remake of Satoru Okada and Yoshio Sakamoto's adventure games for Nintendo.

It's a modern-day port of an older Shin Megami Tensei game that was still experimenting with 3D movement and presentation (those have mostly stuck to the Persona games while later SMTs went back to ...                    game review          4 comments       Resident Evil Village   May 19, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It has been three years since the events of the last game and our favorite, perfectly normal everyman Ethan Winters is trying to live a normal life with his wife and newly born daughter Rose.

This is a game that throws you head-first into the depths of its myriad gameplay systems with only a half-inflated life vest while telling you that you need to learn to swim right now. ― SaGa Frontier is a game whose original release could best be described as unfortunate.

If you've played many of the Yakuza titles and are interested in seeing how it all comes together, I can't recommend this game enough. ― Most Japanese RPGs are wildly fantastical and cartoonish in their setting, but attempt to stay grounded through relatable character writing and conflict.

If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online. Not that it was bad, just that it felt lacking compared to the two storylines that preceded it. So my expectations going into Sword Art Online: Fa...                    game review          6 comments       Ni no Kuni II:Revenant Kingdom   2018 Mar 21, 22:45 6 comments                 games    It took 8 years for a Ni no Kuni sequel to finally surface, and now that it's here, there's both good news and bad for this lavish Studio Ghibli-esque action RPG. ― Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch was a bit too traditional for me. As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase? Heidi Kemps has the answers. ― Omega Force's record with anime and manga adaptations is a bit spotty. We've had disappointments like Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage and Berserk and the Band of the Hawk, but we've also had some real win...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Dragon Ball FighterZ   2018 Jan 29, 23:00 3 comments                 games    Dustin Bailey has the full rundown on the most hotly anticipated DBZ fighting game of all time. Find out if FighterZ lives up to all the hype! ― Dragon Ball FighterZ isn't just a good game for fans of Dragon Ball—it's a great game period, a best-in-class fighter that looks great and is fun to play at any level. That it's crafted with loving reverence to one of the most popular anime on the planet is ...                    game review          4 comments       River City: Rival Showdown   2017 Dec 20, 23:03 4 comments                 games    The open-world gameplay of this breezy beat-em-up returns on the Nintendo 3DS. Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up? Dave Riley finds out. ― With the release of a new console, the Switch, comes the expected glut of HD ports, and Resident Evil Revelations, which has been ported to on average a console and a half per year since its original release on the 3DS in 2012, is...                    game review          10 comments       Etrian Odyssey V: Beyond the Myth   2017 Oct 21, 22:00 10 comments                 games    Does the newest entry in this difficult RPG series still hurt good enough to be worth the challenge? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream. Todd Ciolek has the lowdown on every title in this collection. ― Last year's NES Classic Edition was a finely crafted piece of nostalgia: an authentically miniature Nintendo Entertainment System with thirty built-in games, ranging from enduring classics to dispo...                    game review          25 comments       Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite   2017 Sep 27, 00:00 25 comments                 games    Several changes have been made to this fighting game's new installment, but not all of them are for the better.

Marvel's AIM laboratories host not only MODOK, but also the BOWs of Resident Evil, smu...            For all articles, see the archives       RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken."" Another literally c...                    game review          7 comments       Danganronpa Decadence   Nov 30, 02:00 7 comments                 games    Danganronpa Decadence offers a bit of new content, gameplay, and interactions between cast members, but this little something extra hardly feels decadent. ― Over ten years ago, the first Danganronpa game came out on the PlayStation Portable. Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork. Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally. Additionally, many ...                    game review          9 comments       Death end re;Quest   Jul  6, 03:00 9 comments                 games    Death end proves me dead wrong: it demonstrates not only Idea Factory's ability to put out quality titles, but that they can also be trusted to take real creative risks and create unique games – something all too rare in today's market. ― I wasn't expecting much from Death end re;Quest when I first picked it up.

Grant Jones revisits the franchise to see if the games still hold up to their legacy. ― The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is hard to talk about in isolation. In many ways, you need a dramatic, long-winded cut scene to get the context for the release. So if you'll indulge me, I'll try to spin the tale as bes...                    game review          15 comments       Capcom Arcade Stadium   Jun  7, 00:00 15 comments                 games    Video game archives and collections of this nature are all about making sure these newer generations of gamers get a chance to experience those which laid the groundwork for the stuff that we have today in an easy-to-digest package. ― Judging collections like this is always a bit tricky because we're not reviewing a brand new game made specifically for the current generation; rather, we're technicall...                    game review          1 comment       Famicom Detective Club: The Two-Case Collection   Jun  5, 00:00 1 comment                 games    Both stories have some arbitrary info blocks like this, but even with my sus sense tingling, neither case went exactly where I expected it to go. ― This visual novel double-pack was released for English-speaking audiences for the first time on May 14, offering a shiny remake of Satoru Okada and Yoshio Sakamoto's adventure games for Nintendo.

We dig into a video-game icon's return! ― Don't let the number fool you. This may be the eleventh or twelfth central Mega Man title. It may be backed by several spin-off series. Yet it's been nearly a decade since the last full-blown game in the series. Even then, Mega Man 9 and 10 were deliberate throwbacks, built t...                    game review          4 comments       Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle   2018 Sep 24, 23:00 4 comments                 games    Capcom resurrects a bunch of their classic arcade brawlers with a seven-game collection.

Richard Eisenbeis delivers his full review of the newest entry in this TRPG saga. ― The Valkyria Chronicles series is a piece of historical fiction set in a world much like our own.

Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story.

Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess.

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

Home Anime Cheer Boys Is a Remarkably Mature Anime About Male Cheerleaders    Cheer Boys Is a Remarkably Mature Anime About Male Cheerleaders  By Gina DiGiovancarlo Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Sports anime from the past decade is laden with ""manservice"" shows, but Cheer Boys stands out for its direct opposition to the trend.                 Within anime and manga, the sports genre is typically known for certain characteristics depending on the dominant sex making up the cast. Titles like Slam Dunk and Hajime no Ippo, which revolve around a boys team, are charged with energy and perform anime tropes while adhering closely to the reality of playing the sport. If the cast is a girls team, or even has a mixed team, the aim is typically fan service. Whether it’s Welcome to the Ballroom joking that boys only start dancing to get close to girls or Keijo!!!!!!!! being about girls in bathing suits knocking each other into the water with their chests and butts, the focus is on their bodies and the male gaze.  Starting in the 2010s, however, the norms of sports anime were flipped as more “manservice” series aired. For a short while, anime with all-male casts seemed to be trying to outdo each other on this front, so 2016's refreshingly calm Cheer Boys!! went largely unnoticed. At the time, the Free! franchise had peaked in popularity and the stage was set for titles like Yuri!!! on Ice and All Out!! to make their marks on the sports genre. Cheer Boys!!, however, went against the grain with its more mature, nuanced look at sports. RELATED: Chihayafuru Has Hinted at Potential Romance – But It Isn't Necessary                   While its cast is absolutely one of pretty anime boys, the series doesn’t rely on eye candy. Cheer Boys!! does show its boys in various states of undress, but it’s done in a different way than the manservice shows of its time. Whether it be Haru examining his shoulder in the shower or the boys unwinding at a local bath house, the show's “camera” never focuses on titillation. It handles the cast’s nudity as just another part of their lives rather than a selling point. It can be argued that Cheer Boys!! specifically calls out Free! at one point. One of the latter's best-known scenes from Season 1 is of Rei stretching in a speedo while the “camera” pans over his body in compromising positions. Episode 2 of Cheer Boys!! opens with a similar idea, where the team is practicing in a public area and Mizoguchi is moaning. The sounds and confused faces of passersby linger long enough to imply a sexual nature, but the next shot shows the audience that this isn’t what’s happening. In reality, Haru is helping Mizoguchi stretch beyond his normal range of movement. Haru even smacks the back of his head and tells him to stop making such weird noises.  On top of its trend-breaking stance on sports anime with male casts, Cheer Boys!! also takes a different stance on the genre in general. Taking place in college rather than high school is just the beginning of its differences from the average sports anime. While most series like it have the goal of going to the national competition or its equivalent, Cheer Boys!! takes a mature stance from the start. Most of the original team members choose cheerleading for reasons other than wanting to win a trophy or look cool. Kazu does it because he admires his cheerleader mom, Mizoguchi enjoys challenging himself with new activities and Tono joins in order to change himself as a person.  RELATED: Prince of Tennis II Releases New Teaser Trailer, Key Art                  While winning competitions is a goal down the line, the team's beginnings are humbler than most, starting with two former martial artists and a dream. The Breakers aren't titans with a reputation to uphold or fallen greats like many anime teams; they work with no support and become something worth watching. Even their name, Breakers, comes from a meaningful place. Kazu says he wants to break a lot of things, from the stereotype that cheerleading is for girls to his teammates’ masks and doubts. The other boys agree and add what they want to break by joining this team.  The characters’ lives outside of cheerleading are also prominent and become the source of problems. Cast members in sports anime largely occupy a few spaces: the court/field, or elsewhere in their school. All that matters is the sport -- until exam season rolls around and they have to scramble to get passing marks. It's rare that the characters have problems at home or anything else getting in the way of being an athlete. RELATED: Tribe Nine's Explosive, Bittersweet Finale Confirms the Series' Biggest Message This is not the case in Cheer Boys!!, where more situations have to be accommodated as the team grows. Members who are further along in their education regularly miss practice because they’re job hunting, while others may have to skip because they can’t afford to cut back on shifts at their part-time jobs. For those with the time to dedicate to cheer, especially Hisashi, it looks like they are simply slackers who don’t take the sport seriously. The reality is vastly different.  Cheer Boys!! is far from a perfect anime. At times it weighs too heavily on slice-of-life elements for those looking for a pure sports anime, and the animation is average for 2016. However, its different perspective on sports as a genre makes it stand out. It's calm and mature where comparable series never lose momentum. Victory is a goal, but that isn't all the characters get out of participating. All the while, the story shows bits of where the cast will wind up once they get their degrees.

By Louis Kemner Published 12 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   In the Science Fell in Love anime, Ayame is head over heels for Shinya - and one single moment inspired this infatuation.                 Returning for a second season in the Spring 2022 anime lineup, Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It is a charming rom-com series where the two main lovers use the power of real-life science to determine if they are truly in love or not. Himuro Ayame and Yukimura Shinya have gotten in too deep to stop the experiment -- even if they're making fools of themselves. They have to find conclusive evidence, or else.  It's clear Ayame is deeply infatuated with the aloof Shinya, who is starting to return her feelings more and more. But some fans may not be clear on why she was drawn to him of all people in the first place. Ayame isn't just testing the scientific method for fun -- her feelings are genuine and it all started years in the past, when they first met. RELATED: How Science Fell in Love Became a Battle Shonen          When Shinya Empowered Ayame To Pursue Science                Ayame's strong feelings for Shinya are not a recent development. Neither of them realize it yet, but they have actually crossed paths in their childhood. It was a moment straight out of any slice-of-life anime, but with a science-oriented twist. In their younger days, both Shinya and Ayame were mocked and ostracized for their fixation on science and research, to the point other kids would doodle hurtful remarks on their backpacks.  The difference is that the young Shinya took it in stride and had self-confidence, while the unassertive Ayame felt terrible about her weak social life and external shame as an unpopular geek girl. Ayame suffered low self-esteem until she and Shinya met by chance in a sunlit forest, where they recognized each other as kindred spirits. Most importantly, Shinya, as an aloof kuudere, gave Ayame a pep talk to empower her without being overly affectionate about it. He set a good example for Ayame as a self-assured and hardworking young scientist who put his work first, making it clear that he derives his self-worth and motivation from making scientific discoveries -- similar to Dr. Stone's Senku. The young Ayame, dazzled by Shinya's example, was soon motivated to resume her work and make something of herself, no matter how much she was teased. Even if Shinya was teased too, he held his head high and pursued what he loved, which left a lasting impression on Ayame. Now she has met that inspiring boy scientist once again, but amusingly, neither recognizes the other from that shared memory. But other forces are at work in Science Fell in Love.  RELATED: Science Fell in Love: Meet the Main Cast of Characters          What Ayame's Amorous Feelings Say About Her                The relationship between Ayame and Shinya says a lot about both of them but more so about Ayame, whose romantic feelings were largely one-sided at first. In her childhood, she found Shinya inspiring not because he showed off and acted like a tough guy, but because he dived right into Ayame's heart and sought to soothe her insecurities. The young Shinya told Ayame exactly what she needed to hear with gentle, reassuring words, establishing him as a caring kuudere who cares little for flamboyant displays of masculinity. True, he is secure with his own manhood, but he's not the type who tries to pick up women or vainly show off his athletic prowess. Some girls like a bad boy such as that, but not Ayame. She would consider such things superficial, and so would Shinya for that matter.  RELATED: Science Fell in Love's Season Premiere Continues Anime's New Sadodere Trend Instead, just like Horimiya's Miyamura Izumi, Shinya exudes a comforting and nurturing type of masculinity. That says much about Ayame's refined taste in men, as she evidently prefers partners who have those qualities rather than a star athlete build or a high alcohol tolerance in bars. Perhaps she always felt this way, or her first meeting with Shinya made such an impression that it redefined her taste in boys for years to come. Either way, Ayame's romantic preferences are set in stone by now, and Shinya would never impress her by acting like a boastful star athlete or by driving a muscle car. Not that he would try all that, anyway -- like Ayame, he is devoted to discovery, not vanity. That's an attractive trait in any partner, and it'll be fascinating to see how their relationship evolves as Season 2 of Science Fell in Love gets under way.

Are they right again in suggesting his Quirk makes him like a phoenix?                  This article contains spoilers for My Hero Academia Chapter 349, ""Battle Flame,"" by Kohei Horikoshi, Caleb Cook and John Hunt, available now in English from Viz Media.   Kohei Horikoshi's My Hero Academia is a perfect series for crafting theories. Pieces of the world and its characters are plenty interesting, yet it remains mysterious enough to keep fans guessing about where the story is or could go. Sometimes a widely accepted fan theory is even proved correct, like in 2020 when prominent villain Dabi confirmed that he is, in fact, the presumed-dead Todoroki Toya.  Since this confirmation, Dabi has been on a mission to reach his ultimate goal. He's burning hero society to the ground, literally, and is doing so without care for the damage his Quirk is causing his body. Many speculate that, if he continues at this rate, he'll be his own downfall. RELATED: MHA: The UA Traitor's Most Selfless Moment Hinted at Their Tragic Backstory                 However, a theory that had long been dormant in the My Hero Academia fandom has surfaced once again. Hints of it can be traced to the time before Dabi's identity was revealed, but the additional information since then is adding to its probability. This theory, written in detail by Twitter user Tripol Tivoli in 2021, suggests that Dabi's Quirk has more to it than originally thought. Tivoli suggests it isn't simply a powerful flame emitter Quirk like Endeavor's, but that there's some kind of restorative ability attached to it -- like a phoenix rising from the ashes.  The legend of the phoenix, or of creatures similar to it, can be traced back to ancient civilizations around the world. The mythical bird is commonly associated with the sun -- due to its body of fire -- and rebirth. A common aspect of the phoenix's mythos is that its own fire is what kills it, only to reform from its destroyed body and live again. Dabi's Quirk affects him in a similar way in MHA. He cannot use it for long periods of time without burning himself. However, he has done so to a lethal extent at least once. In Chapter 291 of the MHA manga, it's stated that Toya's Quirk caused a devastating fire and only his lower jaw bone was found. Typically when pieces of a human skull are found, it's safe to presume its owner is deceased. It's hard to believe he'd survive as the source of the fire -- but if his Quirk functions like a phoenix, it's possible that he did.  RELATED: My Hero Academia: Dabi's Inevitable Defeat Is Due to All For One's Carelessness                 Dabi's alias, a reference to the Buddhist cremation ceremony of the same name, also supports this theory. In Buddhism, cremation is preferred because the physical body means little in the religion's beliefs. Since Buddhists believe in reincarnation, the body is nothing more than a vessel for one's soul and will not be needed in their next life. Some may think this is mere coincidence, but that goes against Horikoshi's process for creating his characters. He has stated on a bonus page in Volume 10 of the manga that he comes up with the Quirk first. The character's name comes next, followed by their design. Often, these decisions shape the character's role in the story and any growth they might experience. For example, Bakugo's quirk and strongest personality traits come from his surname, which is a play on the Japanese word for explosion. His given name, Katsuki, is made up of characters meaning ""to win"" and ""self."" These allude to his obsession with victory, but also his journey throughout My Hero Academia to overcome his biggest enemy: himself.  With this in mind, Dabi's name being related to this specific cremation and the beliefs behind it can't be happenstance. He's even dressed in white for this battle, a color widely associated with funerals in Asian countries. This information, when added to the mythos of the phoenix, paints an interesting picture. Todoroki Toya is legally dead, yet there Dabi stands. This fight is going to be his grand exit -- be it by Shoto's hand or his own.

Are they right again in suggesting his Quirk makes him like a phoenix?                  This article contains spoilers for My Hero Academia Chapter 349, ""Battle Flame,"" by Kohei Horikoshi, Caleb Cook and John Hunt, available now in English from Viz Media.   Kohei Horikoshi's My Hero Academia is a perfect series for crafting theories. Pieces of the world and its characters are plenty interesting, yet it remains mysterious enough to keep fans guessing about where the story is or could go. Sometimes a widely accepted fan theory is even proved correct, like in 2020 when prominent villain Dabi confirmed that he is, in fact, the presumed-dead Todoroki Toya.  Since this confirmation, Dabi has been on a mission to reach his ultimate goal. He's burning hero society to the ground, literally, and is doing so without care for the damage his Quirk is causing his body. Many speculate that, if he continues at this rate, he'll be his own downfall. RELATED: MHA: The UA Traitor's Most Selfless Moment Hinted at Their Tragic Backstory                 However, a theory that had long been dormant in the My Hero Academia fandom has surfaced once again. Hints of it can be traced to the time before Dabi's identity was revealed, but the additional information since then is adding to its probability. This theory, written in detail by Twitter user Tripol Tivoli in 2021, suggests that Dabi's Quirk has more to it than originally thought. Tivoli suggests it isn't simply a powerful flame emitter Quirk like Endeavor's, but that there's some kind of restorative ability attached to it -- like a phoenix rising from the ashes.  The legend of the phoenix, or of creatures similar to it, can be traced back to ancient civilizations around the world. The mythical bird is commonly associated with the sun -- due to its body of fire -- and rebirth. A common aspect of the phoenix's mythos is that its own fire is what kills it, only to reform from its destroyed body and live again. Dabi's Quirk affects him in a similar way in MHA. He cannot use it for long periods of time without burning himself. However, he has done so to a lethal extent at least once. In Chapter 291 of the MHA manga, it's stated that Toya's Quirk caused a devastating fire and only his lower jaw bone was found. Typically when pieces of a human skull are found, it's safe to presume its owner is deceased. It's hard to believe he'd survive as the source of the fire -- but if his Quirk functions like a phoenix, it's possible that he did.  RELATED: My Hero Academia: Dabi's Inevitable Defeat Is Due to All For One's Carelessness                 Dabi's alias, a reference to the Buddhist cremation ceremony of the same name, also supports this theory. In Buddhism, cremation is preferred because the physical body means little in the religion's beliefs. Since Buddhists believe in reincarnation, the body is nothing more than a vessel for one's soul and will not be needed in their next life. Some may think this is mere coincidence, but that goes against Horikoshi's process for creating his characters. He has stated on a bonus page in Volume 10 of the manga that he comes up with the Quirk first. The character's name comes next, followed by their design. Often, these decisions shape the character's role in the story and any growth they might experience. For example, Bakugo's quirk and strongest personality traits come from his surname, which is a play on the Japanese word for explosion. His given name, Katsuki, is made up of characters meaning ""to win"" and ""self."" These allude to his obsession with victory, but also his journey throughout My Hero Academia to overcome his biggest enemy: himself.  With this in mind, Dabi's name being related to this specific cremation and the beliefs behind it can't be happenstance. He's even dressed in white for this battle, a color widely associated with funerals in Asian countries. This information, when added to the mythos of the phoenix, paints an interesting picture. Todoroki Toya is legally dead, yet there Dabi stands. This fight is going to be his grand exit -- be it by Shoto's hand or his own.

By Daniel McMahon Published 14 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Ken Kaneki's hair changes color multiple times throughout the Tokyo Ghoul and Tokyo Ghoul:re manga. There are two reasons that explain this.            T     Tokyo Ghoul and Tokyo Ghoul:re follow the life of Ken Kaneki/Haise Sasaki as he is transformed into a ghoul in a freak surgical operation and construction accident. One puzzling aspect of the series is why Kaneiki's hair changes color over the course of the two series and why the author puts such effort into this detail.  There are two reasons why Kaneki's/Sasaki's hair changes color throughout the series. The first reason is direct and explicitly stated, while the other has metaphorical reasoning behind it, requiring the audience to pick up the pieces laid before them. RELATED: The Quietest Anime Shows Typically Have a Lot to Say Ghouls are an exclusively carnivorous and cannibalistic human species that can only feed off of either human or ghoul flesh. Feeding on humans is required once a month as going without it causes severe mental deterioration. A ghoul that goes into extreme starvation eventually loses cognition of everything around them, only seeing the rest of the world as a potential meal. In the case of Rize Kamishiro, being starved by Dr. Kano resulted in her mind being reverted to that of an animal. Consuming only ghouls manages to stave off the hunger temporarily; however, mental deterioration is inevitable.  As seen with Kaneki in the latter half of the Tokyo Ghoul manga, consuming only ghouls caused him to think more erratically, use his kagune less cautiously and isolate himself from his friends at Anteiku. Ghouls have an abnormally high amount of ""RC cells"" that they acquire from eating humans and ghouls and then store in a special ghoul-exclusive organ called the ""kakuho."" Ghouls are able to freely manipulate the density and flexibility of RC cells, allowing them to release the cells from their skin and use them as weapons or limbs. This release of RC cells from the body is called a kagune, of which there are four subdivisions: Ukaku, Rinkaku, Bikaku and Kokaku. Failing to eat human flesh results in a lack of available RC cells, making the user's kagune weaker.                  Besides consuming human and ghoul flesh, there is another way to strengthen the kagune and bolster RC production. To do this, one must experience a plethora of physical pain. Similar to the Sharingan from Naruto, the more pain one endures, the stronger they become. Whether it be from torture or brutal exercise, the damage one receives strengthens the kakuho by increasing the number of cellular tubes that allow for RC cells to be released. This, in turn, creates a positive feedback loop. By enduring pain, the kakuho becomes stronger and a ghoul is able to endure more pain. This positive feedback loop serves to make a ghoul stronger in the long term.  RELATED: The Differences Between Ishvalans in Fullmetal Alchemist and Brotherhood Kaneki was permanently traumatized by many people in his life, but they're all insignificant when compared to the impact Yakumo Oomori, nicknamed ""Yamori,"" had on him. In a game to ""break the One-Eyed,"" Yamori set about to permanently traumatize Kaneki by torturing him the same way Yamori was once tortured by the CCG. Kaneki is forced to count backward from 1,000 in intervals of seven to keep Kaneki sane and prevent disassociation while the torture progresses. Taking advantage of Kaneki's remarkable healing capabilities, Yamori would clip each one of Kaneki's digits off with metal pliers. He also would routinely cut off Kaneki's arms and legs to watch them grow back like fingernails. When Yamori had to leave, he would place a red-headed Chinese centipede into Kaneki's ear to tunnel around and cause him incomparable anguish.                 An important result of Yamori's torture is the unintended consequence of strengthening Kaneki. By repeatedly cutting off and breaking Kaneki's limbs, Yamori had inadvertently strengthened Kaneki's kagune to far surpass his own. The torture resulted in Kaneki's hair changing from black to white because of the increase in cellular tubes in his RC cells in his kakuho, thus increasing his own RC cell count. However, there also remains the metaphorical reason that Kaneki's hair changes color: the loss of his purity. Whenever Kaneki's innocence is irreparably damaged, his RC count spikes and his hair turns white, as seen on two occasions in both the original series and Tokyo Ghoul:re. The foremost example of this is shown when Yamori tortured Kaneki for multiple days, as his hair color is seen to change from panel to panel in Tokyo Ghoul, Chapter 61, ""Glimmer."" He walked into Yamori's torture chamber with dark black hair, and his hair soon lost all pigment during the torture. Following Yamori's torture, Kaneki became a completely different person desperate to protect everyone around him. His hair color denoting his innocence is reinforced in the first chapter of Tokyo Ghoul:re.  RELATED: How Tokyo Revengers Really Compares to Tokyo Ghoul                 Utilizing the ""tabula rasa"" trope, in Tokyo Ghoul:re, Kaneki's mind was wiped clean, and he began a new identity as Haise Sasaki working at the CCG. The most notable physical difference in Sasaki's appearance is that his hair is primarily black while the tips remain white. This alone tells the audience that Sasaki's initial RC count is significantly lower than when his identity was Kaneki. The literal answer as to why his hair regained its complexion is because Sasaki was required by the CCG to take RC suppressants.  As the name implies, RC suppressants suppress the RC cells that ghouls can access, thus impairing their kagune, regenerative abilities and thick skin. An unintentional side effect of RC suppressants is that it also temporarily increases melanin production in the hair, thereby giving back Sasaki his dark hair. As Sasaki slowly comes to terms with his former identity as Kaneki, he is also given the leeway of not having to take as many RC suppressants. Thus, as the series progresses, his hair slowly loses its color once again. The metaphorical answer of ""a reflection of innocence"" for why Kaneki's hair changes color also applies in Tokyo Ghoul:re. When Sasaki has no memory of his former life as Kaneki and his innocence is at its height during the beginning of Tokyo Ghoul:re, his hair is almost black, with small patches of white at the tips. Sasaki's hair is a clear metaphor for his innocence, with the darkness of Kaneki being locked away in the corners of his mind and manifesting as white tips in his hair.  RELATED:  Tokyo Ghoul Creator Shares Fan Art of Olympic Skater Yuzuru Hanyu During Sasaki's lowest point following the Tsukiyama Family Extermination Operation, his personality becomes cold and compassionless. In an attempt to protect himself from being hurt, he isolates himself from the rest of the Q squad and temporarily regains his innocence. This is proven by his hair turning completely black following the Tsukiyama Family Extermination Operation.                  During the Rishima Landing Operation, Sasaki is informed by Eto Yoshimura that the CCG has a darker history than it lets on and has ghouls running the organization. Sasaki rallies his resolve and then releases all the ghouls in Cochlea ranking S and below in the incipience of what would become known as the Second Cochlea Raid. During the Second Cochlea Raid, Sasaki's hair once again adopts a uniform white complexion, indicating his repeated loss of innocence.

09-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.cbr.com/tokyo-ghoul-hair-color-meaning/,What Does Hair Color Mean in Tokyo Ghoul?,"      Home Anime What Does Hair Color Mean in Tokyo Ghoul?    What Does Hair Color Mean in Tokyo Ghoul?  By Daniel McMahon Published 14 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Ken Kaneki's hair changes color multiple times throughout the Tokyo Ghoul and Tokyo Ghoul:re manga. There are two reasons that explain this.            T     Tokyo Ghoul and Tokyo Ghoul:re follow the life of Ken Kaneki/Haise Sasaki as he is transformed into a ghoul in a freak surgical operation and construction accident. One puzzling aspect of the series is why Kaneiki's hair changes color over the course of the two series and why the author puts such effort into this detail.  There are two reasons why Kaneki's/Sasaki's hair changes color throughout the series. The first reason is direct and explicitly stated, while the other has metaphorical reasoning behind it, requiring the audience to pick up the pieces laid before them. RELATED: The Quietest Anime Shows Typically Have a Lot to Say Ghouls are an exclusively carnivorous and cannibalistic human species that can only feed off of either human or ghoul flesh. Feeding on humans is required once a month as going without it causes severe mental deterioration. A ghoul that goes into extreme starvation eventually loses cognition of everything around them, only seeing the rest of the world as a potential meal. In the case of Rize Kamishiro, being starved by Dr. Kano resulted in her mind being reverted to that of an animal. Consuming only ghouls manages to stave off the hunger temporarily; however, mental deterioration is inevitable.  As seen with Kaneki in the latter half of the Tokyo Ghoul manga, consuming only ghouls caused him to think more erratically, use his kagune less cautiously and isolate himself from his friends at Anteiku. Ghouls have an abnormally high amount of ""RC cells"" that they acquire from eating humans and ghouls and then store in a special ghoul-exclusive organ called the ""kakuho."" Ghouls are able to freely manipulate the density and flexibility of RC cells, allowing them to release the cells from their skin and use them as weapons or limbs. This release of RC cells from the body is called a kagune, of which there are four subdivisions: Ukaku, Rinkaku, Bikaku and Kokaku. Failing to eat human flesh results in a lack of available RC cells, making the user's kagune weaker.                  Besides consuming human and ghoul flesh, there is another way to strengthen the kagune and bolster RC production. To do this, one must experience a plethora of physical pain. Similar to the Sharingan from Naruto, the more pain one endures, the stronger they become. Whether it be from torture or brutal exercise, the damage one receives strengthens the kakuho by increasing the number of cellular tubes that allow for RC cells to be released. This, in turn, creates a positive feedback loop. By enduring pain, the kakuho becomes stronger and a ghoul is able to endure more pain. This positive feedback loop serves to make a ghoul stronger in the long term.  RELATED: The Differences Between Ishvalans in Fullmetal Alchemist and Brotherhood Kaneki was permanently traumatized by many people in his life, but they're all insignificant when compared to the impact Yakumo Oomori, nicknamed ""Yamori,"" had on him. In a game to ""break the One-Eyed,"" Yamori set about to permanently traumatize Kaneki by torturing him the same way Yamori was once tortured by the CCG. Kaneki is forced to count backward from 1,000 in intervals of seven to keep Kaneki sane and prevent disassociation while the torture progresses. Taking advantage of Kaneki's remarkable healing capabilities, Yamori would clip each one of Kaneki's digits off with metal pliers. He also would routinely cut off Kaneki's arms and legs to watch them grow back like fingernails. When Yamori had to leave, he would place a red-headed Chinese centipede into Kaneki's ear to tunnel around and cause him incomparable anguish.                 An important result of Yamori's torture is the unintended consequence of strengthening Kaneki. By repeatedly cutting off and breaking Kaneki's limbs, Yamori had inadvertently strengthened Kaneki's kagune to far surpass his own. The torture resulted in Kaneki's hair changing from black to white because of the increase in cellular tubes in his RC cells in his kakuho, thus increasing his own RC cell count. However, there also remains the metaphorical reason that Kaneki's hair changes color: the loss of his purity. Whenever Kaneki's innocence is irreparably damaged, his RC count spikes and his hair turns white, as seen on two occasions in both the original series and Tokyo Ghoul:re. The foremost example of this is shown when Yamori tortured Kaneki for multiple days, as his hair color is seen to change from panel to panel in Tokyo Ghoul, Chapter 61, ""Glimmer."" He walked into Yamori's torture chamber with dark black hair, and his hair soon lost all pigment during the torture. Following Yamori's torture, Kaneki became a completely different person desperate to protect everyone around him. His hair color denoting his innocence is reinforced in the first chapter of Tokyo Ghoul:re.  RELATED: How Tokyo Revengers Really Compares to Tokyo Ghoul                 Utilizing the ""tabula rasa"" trope, in Tokyo Ghoul:re, Kaneki's mind was wiped clean, and he began a new identity as Haise Sasaki working at the CCG. The most notable physical difference in Sasaki's appearance is that his hair is primarily black while the tips remain white. This alone tells the audience that Sasaki's initial RC count is significantly lower than when his identity was Kaneki. The literal answer as to why his hair regained its complexion is because Sasaki was required by the CCG to take RC suppressants.  As the name implies, RC suppressants suppress the RC cells that ghouls can access, thus impairing their kagune, regenerative abilities and thick skin. An unintentional side effect of RC suppressants is that it also temporarily increases melanin production in the hair, thereby giving back Sasaki his dark hair. As Sasaki slowly comes to terms with his former identity as Kaneki, he is also given the leeway of not having to take as many RC suppressants. Thus, as the series progresses, his hair slowly loses its color once again. The metaphorical answer of ""a reflection of innocence"" for why Kaneki's hair changes color also applies in Tokyo Ghoul:re. When Sasaki has no memory of his former life as Kaneki and his innocence is at its height during the beginning of Tokyo Ghoul:re, his hair is almost black, with small patches of white at the tips. Sasaki's hair is a clear metaphor for his innocence, with the darkness of Kaneki being locked away in the corners of his mind and manifesting as white tips in his hair.  RELATED:  Tokyo Ghoul Creator Shares Fan Art of Olympic Skater Yuzuru Hanyu During Sasaki's lowest point following the Tsukiyama Family Extermination Operation, his personality becomes cold and compassionless. In an attempt to protect himself from being hurt, he isolates himself from the rest of the Q squad and temporarily regains his innocence. This is proven by his hair turning completely black following the Tsukiyama Family Extermination Operation.                  During the Rishima Landing Operation, Sasaki is informed by Eto Yoshimura that the CCG has a darker history than it lets on and has ghouls running the organization. Sasaki rallies his resolve and then releases all the ghouls in Cochlea ranking S and below in the incipience of what would become known as the Second Cochlea Raid. During the Second Cochlea Raid, Sasaki's hair once again adopts a uniform white complexion, indicating his repeated loss of innocence.

The hacking incident that caused delays in the production of One Piece and Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero was a targeted ransomware attack.  As reported by the NHK, Toei Animation was the target of a ransomware virus that was uploaded onto the studio's private network and servers. Ransomware attacks, especially on large corporations, have become commonplace in the last several years. The viruses work by encrypting or copying key files on company computers or servers, after which the creators of the ransomware then demand a pay-off from their targets in order to remove the encryption or stop those files from being leaked online. The report does not state if Toei paid the ransom, but it does note that the company shut down its internal networks to confirm the existence of the virus and the extent of the damage it had caused.  RELATED: Dragon Ball Super Reveals Gotenks' Surprising New Look Toei Animation originally announced on March 6 that its networks were breached by ""an unauthorized third party"" and that production on several of its biggest projects would be delayed as a result. Several of its most popular anime series, including One Piece, Digimon: Ghost Game, and Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai, postponed the release of new episodes and were forced to air rerurns for over a month. The producers of One Piece and Digimon recently announced that they were finally ready to begin broadcasting new episodes on April 17, more than six weeks after those episodes were originally scheduled to air. Crunchyroll has confirmed that it will resume streaming the simulcast of these series' new episodes internationally.  As of the writing of this article, a new premiere date has not been announced for Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, the latest movie in the long-running shonen franchise. The highly-anticipated film, which is the first movie in the series to be animated entirely using CG, was originally scheduled to be released in Japan on April 22, with a North American premiere following sometime during the summer. The movie's release was indefinitely postponed following the cyber attack, and while Toei has yet to announce a new premiere date, a recent listing for the movie's novelizations suggests that it may now premiere in Japan sometime next June.  RELATED: Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero Novelizations May Reveal New Premiere Date for Movie Toei is not the only entertainment company to have been the target of this type of hack; most famously, Sony Pictures was the target of a ransomware attack in 2014, in which the hackers reportedly seized over 100 terabytes of private files from the studio. The hackers eventually leaked some of the information they copied and demanded that Sony cancel the release of The Interview, a Seth Rogen comedy about North Korea. Sony eventually did cancel the movie's theatrical run, but released the movie directly through digital distribution services.

The movie's release was indefinitely postponed following the cyber attack, and while Toei has yet to announce a new premiere date, a recent listing for the movie's novelizations suggests that it may now premiere in Japan sometime next June.  RELATED: Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero Novelizations May Reveal New Premiere Date for Movie Toei is not the only entertainment company to have been the target of this type of hack; most famously, Sony Pictures was the target of a ransomware attack in 2014, in which the hackers reportedly seized over 100 terabytes of private files from the studio. The hackers eventually leaked some of the information they copied and demanded that Sony cancel the release of The Interview, a Seth Rogen comedy about North Korea. Sony eventually did cancel the movie's theatrical run, but released the movie directly through digital distribution services.

Home Anime Attack on Titan Solves the Colossal Titans' Biggest Weakness    Attack on Titan Solves the Colossal Titans' Biggest Weakness  By Marc York Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Attack on Titan just addressed the Colossal Titan's biggest weakness, thus cementing them as the strongest Titan.                  The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4, Episode 28, ""The Dawn of Humanity,"" now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll.   The Colossal Titan is one of the most powerful creatures on Attack on Titan. Standing at least 50 meters high, they can lay waste to anything and everything in their path. The only thing that can beat them in either height or power is the Founding Titan -- and even that's somewhat debatable. However, it's exactly because of their size that they have some major weaknesses, especially when it comes to speed.  As powerful as the Colossal Titan is, it can't move its massive body around all that quickly. This much about it was made readily apparent as far back as Season 1. However, the latest episode of The Final Season provided a solution, albeit a temporary one. It turns out that Colossal Titans are unbelievably fearsome when submerged underwater. RELATED: Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2's Biggest Unanswered Questions                  The solution was presented in Episode 87, ""The Dawn of Humanity, in which the nations of the world combined their military force into one massive fleet in order to stop the Rumbling. Their goal was to blast the Colossal Titans out of the water before they could make landfall.  At first, the plan seemed to work. With an impressive round of cannon fire, they were able to blow several Titans to pieces, which then sank to the bottom of the ocean. Unfortunately, this resistance only made matters worse. In response to the fleet's bombardment, the Colossal Titans began moving even faster through the water. Suddenly, these hulking masses of human flesh were moving like torpedoes, which is certainly alarming given their size. A few of them were still hit by the cannon fire, but many of them managed to get through, RELATED: Marco's Final Words on Attack on Titan Are the Anime's Most Important                   The real destruction began as the Colossal titans were passing the fleet. First, the intense steam emitted from the behemoths burned the crews of the ships to a crisp. Not only that, but the steam was apparently so forceful that it sent the fleet flying into the air all at once. These Titans were presumably out of their element, yet they were still able to make quick work of such a massive collection of warships. As powerful as the Titans are on land, it seems as if they're at their most dangerous while swimming. Not only are they hard to hit while underwater, but they can move at a frighteningly fast pace as the need arises. Even when completely submerged, they can still kill their enemies with just their body heat. In water, the Colossal Titan becomes the most powerful creature on the planet by far.

The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4, Episode 28, ""The Dawn of Humanity,"" now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll.   The Colossal Titan is one of the most powerful creatures on Attack on Titan. Standing at least 50 meters high, they can lay waste to anything and everything in their path. The only thing that can beat them in either height or power is the Founding Titan -- and even that's somewhat debatable. However, it's exactly because of their size that they have some major weaknesses, especially when it comes to speed.  As powerful as the Colossal Titan is, it can't move its massive body around all that quickly. This much about it was made readily apparent as far back as Season 1. However, the latest episode of The Final Season provided a solution, albeit a temporary one. It turns out that Colossal Titans are unbelievably fearsome when submerged underwater. RELATED: Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2's Biggest Unanswered Questions                  The solution was presented in Episode 87, ""The Dawn of Humanity, in which the nations of the world combined their military force into one massive fleet in order to stop the Rumbling. Their goal was to blast the Colossal Titans out of the water before they could make landfall.  At first, the plan seemed to work. With an impressive round of cannon fire, they were able to blow several Titans to pieces, which then sank to the bottom of the ocean. Unfortunately, this resistance only made matters worse. In response to the fleet's bombardment, the Colossal Titans began moving even faster through the water. Suddenly, these hulking masses of human flesh were moving like torpedoes, which is certainly alarming given their size. A few of them were still hit by the cannon fire, but many of them managed to get through, RELATED: Marco's Final Words on Attack on Titan Are the Anime's Most Important                   The real destruction began as the Colossal titans were passing the fleet. First, the intense steam emitted from the behemoths burned the crews of the ships to a crisp. Not only that, but the steam was apparently so forceful that it sent the fleet flying into the air all at once. These Titans were presumably out of their element, yet they were still able to make quick work of such a massive collection of warships. As powerful as the Titans are on land, it seems as if they're at their most dangerous while swimming. Not only are they hard to hit while underwater, but they can move at a frighteningly fast pace as the need arises. Even when completely submerged, they can still kill their enemies with just their body heat. In water, the Colossal Titan becomes the most powerful creature on the planet by far.

Lupin the Third Part 6 is coming to Toonami.  The programming block announced on its official FaceBook page that newest season of Lupin the Third will be joining its lineup on April 16. The show will air in the 1:30 A.M. Saturday night/ Sunday morning timeslot that was previously occupied by Made in Abyss, which will air its season finale on April 9. Lupin the Third Part 6 was originally broadcast in Japan from October 2021 – March 2022, and was simulcast exclusively on Sentai Filmworks' HIDIVE streaming service. RELATED: Entire Lupin the Third TV Series Is Now Available to Stream Lupin the Third Part 6 was first announced as part of the series' 50th anniversary celebration and marks the anime's return to TMS Animation, the studio that handled production of the series from 1971 – 2015. The season is also notable for featuring the last episode starring the final member of the original Lupin the Third voice cast, Kiyoshi Kobayashi, who provided the voice of Jigen for the past 50 years. Kobayashi retired from acting in 2021 and voiced Lupin's most trusted partner-in-crime one last time for Part 6's first episode. The role was then passed on to actor Akio Otsuka, a veteran voice actor who is best known for providing the Japanese voice of Solid Snake in the Metal Gear Solid video game series and for his role as the heroic All Might in the popular My Hero Academia shonen anime.  Lupin the Third was created by manga artist Monkey Punch and was first published in 1967. The character of Lupin the Third is meant to be the grandchild of the famed literary thief Arsene Lupin, who was created in 1905 by French author Maurice LeBlanc. The series is widely regarded as one of the most influential anime and manga franchises of all time, as it helped to launch the directorial career of Hayao Miyazaki and served as a direct influence on numerous other works, including Shinichiro Watanabe's Cowboy Bebop.

The classic Shonen Jump series City Hunter will return with a new movie.  The new animated film was announced with a short teaser trailer that shows series' protagonist, Ryo Saeba, who will once again be voiced by veteran voice actor Akira Kamiya, who portrayed the character in the original 1987 anime series. The trailer is set to the song ""Get Wild"" by Japanese new wave band TM Network. The song was previously used as the first ending theme for the classic anime. A premiere date was not announced for the movie, but the preview does state that the movie is being produced to coincide with the 35th anniversary of the anime's premiere, which will occur in 2023.  RELATED: A Guide to City Hunter, the Cult Crime Franchise    City Hunter tells the story of Ryo Saeba, who survived a plane crash in Central America as a young child and is raised as a guerilla soldier. After honing his skills through a lifetime of warfare, Saeba returns to Japan as an adult, where he decides to use his talents to make a living as a private detective. The series was created by writer and artist Tsukasa Hojo. Hojo's original manga was serialized in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1985–1991. The manga was one of the biggest hits of the era in Japan, and several publishers attempted to license the series for release in the West, but these plans were stalled after Hojo refused to allow his artwork to be flipped and insisted that it only be published in manga's standard right-to-left format, which would have been unfamiliar with readers outside of Asia at the time. The manga was finally released in English in the early 2000s.  RELATED: Shonen Jump Publisher Enters Gaming Industry with Shueisha Games Hojo's manga is also notable for the amount of times it has been adapted: the series was first brought to the screen with the previously mentioned 1987 anime adaptation, which was produced by legendary animation studio Sunrise (Mobile Suit Gundam, Cowboy Bebop). The anime series ended in 1991, but the series has release multiple movies in the years since, the most recent of which was 2019's City Hunter: The Movie - Shinjuku Private Eyes. A number of live-action adaptations based on the manga have also been produced, including a Korean drama, a Japanese TV series, and most notably, a Hong Kong martial arts movie starring Jackie Chan.  The original anime and its follow-up movies are available for streaming on Crunchyroll.

As far as Fujiwara Chika is concerned, she's the main character of Kaguya-sama: Love Is War. The Student Council Secretary is as loveable as she is unlikeable, and her delightfully inane shenanigans are outweighed only by the chaos and destruction she wreaks upon the Student Council Room every time she enters or exists in close proximity to it. She's the kind of character who viewers can't wait to see what she'll do next but also wish she would just go away. The paradox to end all paradoxes, Fujiwara is the best, worst, most annoying and most important character in a series that she goes to extraordinary lengths to make about herself.  In Fujiwara's defense, it's not like her fellow Student Council members are entirely well-adjusted either. Shinomiya Kaguya usually considers Fujiwara either sub-human garbage she'd prefer to set adrift at sea without a life jacket or her best friend, depending on whatever it is that Fujiwara has most recently said or done. Fujiwara often deserves Shinomiya's ire, but she also must be protected at all costs because the audience deserves to know whether or not Fujiwara is intentionally ruining the love war between Shinomiya and Shirogane. Fujiwara is either a diabolical genius or an unbiased force of nature whose lifeblood is the very chaos she ignites wherever she goes.  RELATED: Kaguya-sama: What's the Score Heading Into Season 3?          Fujiwara Is Kaguya-Sama's Best Character                 There's never a dull moment when Fujiwara is around. At any moment, she's liable to break out in a highly choreographed dance, suggest an overly-complicated game that she'll instantly start cheating at or show a seasoned ramen lover what a real connoisseur looks like. She's a good friend to Shirogane whenever he needs help with whatever new thing he's terrible at, and she undoubtedly adores Shinomiya. Fujiwara can't be pigeonholed because she's doing something different every episode, either showing off incredible intelligence and skill or an incredible lack thereof. She's a member of the Tabletop Game Club, the conductor for the morning singing of Shuchi'in Academy's anthem, a proud dog mom, an average volleyball player and an ace(ish) detective who can't whistle or read the room. The only thing that's predictable about her is her unpredictability, and it's her biggest strength as the series' most versatile character.          Fujiwara Is Also Love Is War's Worst Character                 The flip side to Fujiwara's versatility is that she's more of a plot device than a character. Need a funny joke to end an otherwise serious scene? Send in Fujiwara. Need someone for a lead character to confide in to further their own story? Fujiwara's the gal for the job. Ishigami has gotten his own episode devoted to his history and the challenges he's overcome, and even Hayasaka has had some sympathetic moments as Shinomiya's caretaker. Fujiwara, unfortunately, has never had any kind of character arc because her role is simply to cause madness and mayhem. She has never had a personal insecurity to overcome, an enemy to defeat or even a brief moment of self-reflection. Fujiwara is only here for a good time, and she doesn't accept criticism or responsibility, which would make her hard to root for if there was ever anything actually happening with her.  RELATED: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Season 3 to Premiere in US Theaters          Fujiwara Is The Series' Most Annoying Character                 Despite Fujiwara's best efforts, she is not the main character of Kaguya-sama: Love Is War -- in fact, she might actually be the villain. The battle between Shinomiya and Shirogane to get the other to confess their love is the driving force of the series, and Fujiwara is constantly derailing it. Shinomiya and Shirogane are possibly two of the most stubborn characters in anime, considering the entire premise of their show is based on how stubborn they are. On the rare occasion that one or both of them drop their guard and there's an opportunity for them to give up the act and be together, here comes Fujiwara to eat the food they're feeding each other or just kill the vibe in general. Once or twice could be chalked up to bad timing, but Fujiwara might just be the biggest reason that Shinomiya and Shirogane aren't a couple yet -- other than their own pride, of course.          Kaguya-sama: Love Is War Couldn't Survive Without Fujiwara                 Given that the whole point of the show is who's going to confess first, a confession can't happen at all until the end of the series, as without Shinomiya and Shirogane's battle, there's no story. This makes Fujiwara the most important character because her constant, exhausting, frustrating, childish, selfish and hilarious interruptions and love-blocking antics keep the series afloat. There should be exactly zero fans of Fujiwara Chika given the undesirable role of roadblock that she's forced to play in the series. That she's so loved despite this is a testament to the strength of her character, even if nothing about her ever makes sense -- because without her, the show wouldn't make sense either.

RELATED: Kaguya-sama: What's the Score Heading Into Season 3?          Fujiwara Is Kaguya-Sama's Best Character                 There's never a dull moment when Fujiwara is around. At any moment, she's liable to break out in a highly choreographed dance, suggest an overly-complicated game that she'll instantly start cheating at or show a seasoned ramen lover what a real connoisseur looks like. She's a good friend to Shirogane whenever he needs help with whatever new thing he's terrible at, and she undoubtedly adores Shinomiya. Fujiwara can't be pigeonholed because she's doing something different every episode, either showing off incredible intelligence and skill or an incredible lack thereof. She's a member of the Tabletop Game Club, the conductor for the morning singing of Shuchi'in Academy's anthem, a proud dog mom, an average volleyball player and an ace(ish) detective who can't whistle or read the room. The only thing that's predictable about her is her unpredictability, and it's her biggest strength as the series' most versatile character.          Fujiwara Is Also Love Is War's Worst Character                 The flip side to Fujiwara's versatility is that she's more of a plot device than a character. Need a funny joke to end an otherwise serious scene? Send in Fujiwara. Need someone for a lead character to confide in to further their own story? Fujiwara's the gal for the job. Ishigami has gotten his own episode devoted to his history and the challenges he's overcome, and even Hayasaka has had some sympathetic moments as Shinomiya's caretaker. Fujiwara, unfortunately, has never had any kind of character arc because her role is simply to cause madness and mayhem. She has never had a personal insecurity to overcome, an enemy to defeat or even a brief moment of self-reflection. Fujiwara is only here for a good time, and she doesn't accept criticism or responsibility, which would make her hard to root for if there was ever anything actually happening with her.  RELATED: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Season 3 to Premiere in US Theaters          Fujiwara Is The Series' Most Annoying Character                 Despite Fujiwara's best efforts, she is not the main character of Kaguya-sama: Love Is War -- in fact, she might actually be the villain. The battle between Shinomiya and Shirogane to get the other to confess their love is the driving force of the series, and Fujiwara is constantly derailing it. Shinomiya and Shirogane are possibly two of the most stubborn characters in anime, considering the entire premise of their show is based on how stubborn they are. On the rare occasion that one or both of them drop their guard and there's an opportunity for them to give up the act and be together, here comes Fujiwara to eat the food they're feeding each other or just kill the vibe in general. Once or twice could be chalked up to bad timing, but Fujiwara might just be the biggest reason that Shinomiya and Shirogane aren't a couple yet -- other than their own pride, of course.          Kaguya-sama: Love Is War Couldn't Survive Without Fujiwara                 Given that the whole point of the show is who's going to confess first, a confession can't happen at all until the end of the series, as without Shinomiya and Shirogane's battle, there's no story. This makes Fujiwara the most important character because her constant, exhausting, frustrating, childish, selfish and hilarious interruptions and love-blocking antics keep the series afloat. There should be exactly zero fans of Fujiwara Chika given the undesirable role of roadblock that she's forced to play in the series. That she's so loved despite this is a testament to the strength of her character, even if nothing about her ever makes sense -- because without her, the show wouldn't make sense either.

Many works throughout the decades have adapted and re-imagined the writings of William Shakespeare, but perhaps none more so than Requiem of the Rose King. Combining two Shakespeare plays into one, the result is an entirely different story altogether. The original manga recently came to an end just as the anime began, with two versions of the very altered history now available.  History and literature buffs who think they know the story already are in for several surprises, while those who don't even like Shakespeare are sure to find something that they enjoy in the franchise. Here's more on what Requiem of the Rose King is about, as well as how to read and watch the different versions of it. RELATED: How to Get Started With K-On!          The Plot of Requiem of the Rose King                 Requiem of the Rose King loosely combines elements of William Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3 and Richard III, turning the War of the Roses completely on its head. In the story, the Houses of York and Lancaster battle over England, with the House of York losing its leader to a deadly enemy attack. Left in the wake of this loss is Richard III, the king's intersex son who identifies as male. Richard is hated and feared by many around him, including his own mother, all while spirits torture and subjugate him. Forced into an unlikely situation, Richard prepares to defend his house while dealing with external and internal threats.  RELATED: How to Get Started With Ouran High School Host Club          Where to Read the Requiem of the Rose King Manga                 Requiem of the Rose King began as a manga from Aya Kanno in October 2013, being published in the magazine Monthly Princess. The series ran for almost nine years, ending in early 2022. In the West, the series has been localized by Viz Media, with 14 of the 17 volumes having been released in English-speaking territories. The series has two spin-offs: King of Idol: Bara-Ō no Gakuen and Bara-Ō no Sōretsu: Gaiden. The former is a more humorous spin-off where the characters are in high school studying to become entertainers, while the latter focuses on events not shown in the main series. Since both of them only began in the last year, neither has yet been localized. The main series' manga can be purchased physically wherever manga is sold, including Walmart, Books-a-Million, Barnes & Noble and Amazon, while Kindle and Comixology carry the digital version.  RELATED: How to Get Started With Bakuman          Where to Watch the Requiem of the Rose King Anime                The anime adaptation of the series began airing in January 2022, just as the manga ended, although it was originally intended to come out in late 2021. Requiem of the Rose King was animated by J.C. Staff, a well-known studio whose recent works include the anime for How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom as well as Is It Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?. The result is a series with beautiful, breathtaking art, befitting the nature of the characters. So far, 13 episodes have aired in Japan, with the show planned to air for two consecutive cours. The only way to watch the series in the West currently is through the Funimation streaming service. However, this service simulcast Requiem of the Rose King, so it's only available as a subtitled series and not dubbed. However, once the series has finished its run, a dub and physical releases will likely be on the way.

The following contains spoilers for Season 2 of Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon, now streaming on Crunchyroll, Funimation, Animelab and Hulu.   With the recent conclusion of Yashahime Season 2, fans have been left with several questions surrounding the Great Dog Demon Family and the original cast of Inuyasha. After the Season 2 finale wrapped up the series' main plot arc with the death of Kirinmaru, the heroes seem happy and free of conflict at last.  While this peaceful and reflective season finale left many wondering if Season 2 will be the end of the entire series, there are still several unanswered questions for Yashahime to hopefully address in future seasons. RELATED: Yashahime Concludes Its Biggest Arc Yet With Death - and Happiness          Does Sesshomaru Love His Daughters?                At the end of Season 2, Towa and Setsuna reunite with their mother Rin to celebrate their recent victory. When Rin gifts her twin daughters fancy fabrics given to them by their father, the twins question his actions and parenting style. They ask Rin why Sesshōmaru didn't help them more when they were growing up -- and when they faced Zero and Kirinmaru.  After calling their father's love for them into question, Rin assures her daughters that he loves them and is relieved that they grew up to become strong on their own. Despite Sesshōmaru displaying tremendous character growth as he operated in the shadows to protect his family, the twins hope to uncover their kuudere father's true feelings. RELATED: The Best Isekai in Which the Main Character Returns Home          How Is Riku Still Alive?                 As the former horn of Kirinmaru, Riku has proven to have several lives in Yashahime. After suffering many fatal and near-fatal injuries, this mysterious character has always managed to return from the grave to shock fans. Toward the very end of Season 2, Riku is killed by Mr. Kirin within the Grim Butterfly. He says a tearful goodbye to Towa and confesses his love for her before seemingly dying for good.  However, when Towa's body is returned to her by Rion, many fans spotted a mysterious horn-shaped figure inside her body. In the Season 2 finale, Riku is resurrected and reappears to explain that he is no longer part of Kirinmaru -- and that he was revived by Rion and Kirinmaru's Kon and Haku. Setsuna questions how this is possible, as do many fans. RELATED: Yashahime Tackles the Morality of Humans and Demons          Why Didn't Sango and Miroku Raise Moroha?                 Since Yashahime began, many fans questioned the noticeable absence of the original Inuyasha cast. Despite Sango and Miroku being alive and well with their own family, they are surprisingly absent from Moroha's life. Kagome and Inuyasha instructed Hachi to take the baby Moroha to the Wolf Demon Tribe for protection instead of entrusting their two best friends with their daughter in their absence.  While they may have chosen Koga and the Wolf Demon Tribe for protection and the strength in numbers, Sango and Miroku have proven their own strength and capabilities time and time again. Not only were Sango and Miroku oddly absent from Moroha's life, but Shippo somehow failed to find Moroha despite her living nearby. RELATED: What Religion Do Anime Monks Like Inyuasha's Miroku Practice?          How Strong Is Shippo Now?                 During the time skip between Inuyasha and Yashahime, it's revealed that Shippo has become a respectable and powerful teacher at a fox-demon school. After spending most of Inuyasha training to become a full-fledged fox demon, he now has the 25th and highest rank in the demon promotions and spends most of his time preparing others for their own exams.  In his first appearance in the sequel, Shippo surprised fans by taking on the form of an elderly fox and a young man before returning to his more familiar younger form. After achieving the highest rank and learning advanced Fox Magic like ""Up, Up, and Away"", many fans are wondering just how powerful Shippo has become and what tricks he might reveal later in the series. RELATED: Should Moroha Have Been Yashahime's Main Character?          Which Twin is Stronger: Towa or Setsuna?                 Towa and Setsuna sparred several times throughout Yashahime when they were pitted against each other by their enemies or emotional outbursts. Given their unique strengths and weaknesses that cancel each other out, these battles typically ended it stalemates. Since the sisters wield different weapons and inherited different powers from their immensely powerful father, it's incredibly difficult to compare the two. While they are both inarguably strong as the daughters of the Great Beast King of the West, the series has never revealed who would ultimately win in an all-out fight between the two.                   After Its Satisfying Season 2 Finale, Does Yashahime Need a Season 3?

Towa and Setsuna sparred several times throughout Yashahime when they were pitted against each other by their enemies or emotional outbursts. Given their unique strengths and weaknesses that cancel each other out, these battles typically ended it stalemates. Since the sisters wield different weapons and inherited different powers from their immensely powerful father, it's incredibly difficult to compare the two. While they are both inarguably strong as the daughters of the Great Beast King of the West, the series has never revealed who would ultimately win in an all-out fight between the two.                   After Its Satisfying Season 2 Finale, Does Yashahime Need a Season 3?

A talented fan has transformed the grubby Trash Bag Pokémon, Trubbish, into a creature of pure elegance and beauty.  Popular cosplayer and vtuber Mink the Satyr posted multiple pictures of her Trubbish-inspired costume to Twitter. The beautiful evening gown features delicate lace, billowing sleeves and a full skirt. The cosplayer also uploaded a much more comical version of the costume as an April Fool's joke. RELATED: Electrifying Pokémon Fan Art Reimagines a Legendary Monster as Mech    According to the various Pokédex entries for the monster, Trubbish is a fifth-generation Pokémon and a fusion of garbage bags, industrial waste and chemical agents. It belches toxic gas and has a tendency to follow individuals who litter around. Beyond the games, Trubbish has appeared several times in the greater Pokémon franchise, making minor appearances, for example, in the episodes ""Crystal-Clear Sleuthing!"" and ""Love at First Twirl!"" in Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon.  There have been more recent developments in the Pokémon franchise than just beautiful cosplays. Most notably, two new games -- Pokémon Scarlet and Violet -- are scheduled to debut sometime late this year. These games will introduce fans to the ninth generation of Pokémon and many have already fallen in love with the new starters -- Fucecoco, Sprigatito and Quaxly. Scarlet and Violet will include the open-world gameplay style featured in Pokémon Legends: Arceus and showcase a Spain-inspired setting. RELATED: Study Finds Sonic the Hedgehog Is More Popular Than Pokémon  Moreover, the next batch of episodes for the Pokémon Master Journeys anime series are on their way. While the official premiere date is presently unknown, a teaser trailer and a new poster provide insight into upcoming story beats. These include Ash reuniting with his Greninja, Chloe competing in a contest with her Eevee and Goh encountering the legendary Pokémon Suicune (and possibly Mew as well). Pokémon Master Journeys is the twenty-fourth mainline anime series for the franchise; it premiered on Dec. 11, 2020, in Japan and in the United States on Sept. 10, 2021. An anime based on Pokémon Legends: Arceus has also been announced. While little information about the series has been released, it is expected to premiere online sometime in 2022. Arceus is also getting a special tie-in expansion for the Pokémon Trading Card Game. Astral Radiance will introduce a wealth of cards to the ever-expanding tabletop game and will usher in Radiant Pokémon, a brand-new mechanic. The expansion is scheduled to launch on May 27 and pre-orders are now available.  Several entries in the Pokémon franchise, including Pokémon Master Journeys, can be found and streamed on Netflix. Pokémon Legends: Arceus is now available exclusively for the Nintendo Switch.

One creative superhero fan has merged the magical worlds of Naoko Takeuchi's Sailor Moon and the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Moon Knight, creating ""the crossover no one asked for.""  The image, which was posted on Twitter by professional production designer Mingjue Helen Chen, depicts Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon donning a costume reminiscent of Marc Spector/Moon Knight's super suit. The long, white cape and Usagi's iconic blond hair flutter in the foreground, while a glowing crescent moon features in the background. According to Chen, this fusion is ""the only thing I think of when I watch Moon Knight."" RELATED: A Decade After Sailor Moon Debuted, Its Director Created a Far Less Popular Sports Anime      Based on the character created by writer Doug Moench and artist Don Perlin, Moon Knight premiered on March 30 and is the sixth television series in the MCU. The show stars Oscar Isaac as the titular hero, who is a mercenary who suffers from dissociative identity disorder. Other members of the case include May Calamawy, Ethan Hawke and Karim El-Hakim. The show's creative team includes writer Jeremy Slater (The Umbrella Academy), cinematographer Andrew Droz Palermo (The Green Knight) and director Mohamed Diab.  Moon Knight's story is heavily rooted in the culture of ancient Egypt, and those involved have made an active effort to stay as historically and mythologically accurate as possible. This careful attention to detail is notable in the wake of Diab's criticism of DC comic book movies, including Wonder Woman 1984, for their inaccurate depictions of the country and its culture. RELATED: Marvel Fans Are Convinced Moon Knight Dropped the MCU's First F-Bomb The original Sailor Moon manga series was published in Kodansha's Nakayoshi magazine from 1991 to 1997, producing 18 volumes worth of content. The story follows high schooler Usagi and her friends as they fight villains and prevent the destruction of the universe as the Sailor Guardians. The manga has a devoted fan following; over 35 million copies of the series have been sold globally.  The Sailor Moon manga was first adapted into an anime by Toei Animation in 1992 and has gone on to inspire a wealth of tie-in books, films, video and tabletop games, stage musicals and even an ice skating show. It has also spawned several theme park attractions; the popular Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon The Miracle 4D: Moon Palace Chapter attraction from 2019 is set to return as part of this year's Universal Cool Japan and will feature an extra scene. The first season of Moon Knight is currently making its debut on Disney+, and various entries in the Sailor Moon franchise are available to stream on Funimation, Crunchyroll, Hulu, Amazon Prime and Netflix.

09-04-2022,anime,3,0,https://www.cbr.com/sailor-moon-knight-fan-art-lunar-crossover-anime-mcu/,Sailor Moon Knight Fan Art Is a Marvel-ous Lunar Hero Crossover,"      Home Anime Sailor Moon Knight Fan Art Is the Ultimate Lunar Hero Crossover    Sailor Moon Knight Fan Art Is the Ultimate Lunar Hero Crossover  By Hayley McCullough Published 17 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Sailor Moon dons the costume of Marvel's Moon Knight in a new piece of epic mashup fan art that celebrates both the anime and the new Disney+ series.                 One creative superhero fan has merged the magical worlds of Naoko Takeuchi's Sailor Moon and the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Moon Knight, creating ""the crossover no one asked for.""  The image, which was posted on Twitter by professional production designer Mingjue Helen Chen, depicts Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon donning a costume reminiscent of Marc Spector/Moon Knight's super suit. The long, white cape and Usagi's iconic blond hair flutter in the foreground, while a glowing crescent moon features in the background. According to Chen, this fusion is ""the only thing I think of when I watch Moon Knight."" RELATED: A Decade After Sailor Moon Debuted, Its Director Created a Far Less Popular Sports Anime      Based on the character created by writer Doug Moench and artist Don Perlin, Moon Knight premiered on March 30 and is the sixth television series in the MCU. The show stars Oscar Isaac as the titular hero, who is a mercenary who suffers from dissociative identity disorder. Other members of the case include May Calamawy, Ethan Hawke and Karim El-Hakim. The show's creative team includes writer Jeremy Slater (The Umbrella Academy), cinematographer Andrew Droz Palermo (The Green Knight) and director Mohamed Diab.  Moon Knight's story is heavily rooted in the culture of ancient Egypt, and those involved have made an active effort to stay as historically and mythologically accurate as possible. This careful attention to detail is notable in the wake of Diab's criticism of DC comic book movies, including Wonder Woman 1984, for their inaccurate depictions of the country and its culture. RELATED: Marvel Fans Are Convinced Moon Knight Dropped the MCU's First F-Bomb The original Sailor Moon manga series was published in Kodansha's Nakayoshi magazine from 1991 to 1997, producing 18 volumes worth of content. The story follows high schooler Usagi and her friends as they fight villains and prevent the destruction of the universe as the Sailor Guardians. The manga has a devoted fan following; over 35 million copies of the series have been sold globally.  The Sailor Moon manga was first adapted into an anime by Toei Animation in 1992 and has gone on to inspire a wealth of tie-in books, films, video and tabletop games, stage musicals and even an ice skating show. It has also spawned several theme park attractions; the popular Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon The Miracle 4D: Moon Palace Chapter attraction from 2019 is set to return as part of this year's Universal Cool Japan and will feature an extra scene. The first season of Moon Knight is currently making its debut on Disney+, and various entries in the Sailor Moon franchise are available to stream on Funimation, Crunchyroll, Hulu, Amazon Prime and Netflix.

Home Anime 10 Things Goku Can Learn From Vegeta    10 Things Goku Can Learn From Vegeta  By CBR Staff Published 11 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   If Goku could pick up on some of the qualities that Vegeta has, Goku could become just as powerful as any God of destruction.                  Goku and Vegeta have been friendly rivals since Dragon Ball Z, but Goku has always been the more relied upon fighter between the two. Goku may currently be the strongest fighter, but Vegeta has been making many strides to keep up with his rival counterpart as the series progresses.  RELATED: 10 Best Things About Goku Under Whis' tutelage paired with their constant encounters with stronger foes, Goku and Vegeta have had their work cut out for them. Whis has mentioned the flaws that each fighter possesses and points out that the two are strongest when fused together. If Goku could pick up on some of the qualities that Vegeta has, Goku could become just as powerful as any God of destruction.  10          Having A Sense Of Pride As A Saiyan                 Part of Goku's charm is that he doesn't carry the same level of pride as his warrior race, the Saiyans. By comparison, Vegeta's greatest asset as the ""Prince of all Saiyans"" is his incomparable pride of being one.  Goku learning more about the Saiyans' pride may make him a bit more boastful, but finding confidence in being a natural-born warrior may go a long way in his mentality when fighting. This sense of pride may help Goku take fights a bit more seriously.  9          Being A (Better) Role Model For Your Kids                 Fans of Dragon Ball would agree that Goku hasn't necessarily been around for a good portion of Gohan's youth. Whenever Goku showed up, trouble would soon follow. Vegeta on the other hand has grown to become a great parent and is looked up to by both present and future Trunks. RELATED:Dragon Ball Z: 10 Times Goku Put Himself Before His Family  Goku isn't winning any ""Father Of The Year"" awards compared to Vegeta's level of parenting. Vegeta is shown spending quality time taking care of the kids, and not all time spent with his son Trunks' training.  8          Having Original Attacks                 The Kamehameha and Solar Flare are some of Goku's signature attacks. Sadly, those abilities aren't his original moves. A lot of Goku's moves and abilities were taught to him by teachers he either sought out or ran into. For Goku to be the main protagonist, it's surprising that he doesn't have a move that he has created on his own.  Vegeta has a bunch of special moves, that surprisingly, Goku hasn't taken and made his own. From his famous Galick Gun to Big Bang Attack, Vegeta has mastered many moves that weren't taught to him by Gods or aliens.  7          How To Treat Your Wife                 Why Chi-Chi is still with Goku remains a mystery, but being married to the strongest warrior in the universe must have some perks. However, Vegeta has gone the extra mile and has shown multiple subtle displays of affection to his wife, Bulma, that Goku could take notes on. Vegeta and Bulma may not have started off on the right foot, but Vegeta has shown admiration for his wife's abilities and agitation towards anyone that would bother ""his Bulma."" Vegeta hasn't spent many years away from his family to train in the afterlife and has taken on babysitting the kids whenever his wife asked.  6          Vegeta's Fashion Sense If these two had to do a popularity contest based on style, Vegeta would win every time. Goku has been wearing the same orange gi since Dragon Ball. Dragon Ball GT finally gave him a new gi color, but the style was lacking compared to Vegeta's. The few times Goku has changed, the clothes wouldn't fit him very well, and he has mentioned that he doesn't feel comfortable in clothes that fit him. Maybe give credit to Bulma for Vegeta's trendy clothes, but Vegeta's style doesn't mind taking risks. Remember when Vegeta had a mustache?  5          Showing Respect To Higher Beings                 Goku has been on the verge of ending many lives by just being the whimsical martial artist he is. For someone that can read power levels and sense ki energy, Goku usually lacks formality towards gods and other higher beings that can easily wipe away existences. Vegeta, who is aware of the statuses and legends of these beings, always rolls out the red carpet. RELATED: 10 Times Goku Was Put In His Place In Dragon Ball Although his pride usually overshadows his judgment, Vegeta knows when to be quiet and respectful toward those higher in power. Especially when that power can wipe away or restore a universe. Vegeta provides many meals for Beerus and Whis just to keep the earth safe.  4          Taking Fights More Seriously                 Fans all know the feeling when the Z warriors are about to defeat the enemy, but Goku lets them power up again to turn the tide. Goku never takes his fights seriously until someone dies. He even played around with the likes of Kid Buu's destructive tendencies just to see the extent of his power. Vegeta was a victim of this mentality in the Cell Saga and dearly paid for it. Fast-forward to Vegeta's training with Whis, he has learned to fight at full power regardless of what level his opponent is. Goku has even been told by Whis that he would be stronger if he fought more seriously.  3          Know That All Evil Can't Be Redeemed                 Throughout the series, Goku has met a lot of opponents that later became friends or rivals. Most of his current friends were once conflicts that Goku has to deal with. However, there are some characters that are too evil to be kept alive and have no hope of turning over a new leaf. Vegeta is the opposite and will end an opponent's life without hesitation. Maybe if Goku had Vegeta's standards on what is evil, the majority of Dragon Ball's villains wouldn't be later threats or still trying to destroy the earth.  2          Utilizing Battle Tactics                 Whenever Goku gets into a fight, it's rare to see him thinking with his head. He fights instinctively and doesn't have much of a plan when facing tough opponents. Thanks to his friends and allies, Goku has managed to prevail over foes, but maybe fighting an opponent one-on-one isn't the best idea.  RELATED: 10 Things Goku Learned From Whis Goku could learn to fire a ki blast whenever an enemy has their back turned to him. Vegeta was the difference for shooting Cell in the back when Gohan was struggling against him. It's not fighting dirty, just strategy by catching your opponent by surprise.  1          Goku Can Learn To Be More Careful In Battles                 In Dragon Ball Super, Whis has pointed out Goku's weakness: he's too careless. Though some may describe Goku as more of a clear-headed individual, Vegeta is more of a careful and tactical fighter. Goku could benefit from Vegeta's way of thinking.  Goku letting opponents reach full power or thinking they will turn over a new leaf has gotten him and his friends into a lot of trouble. Vegeta didn't give a second thought to destroying Cooler, Frieza's brother. Maybe Goku should reconsider Frieza's threat level since his potential is so high.

09-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.cbr.com/goku-lessons-from-vegeta-dragonball/,10 Things Goku Can Learn From Vegeta,"      Home Anime 10 Things Goku Can Learn From Vegeta    10 Things Goku Can Learn From Vegeta  By CBR Staff Published 11 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   If Goku could pick up on some of the qualities that Vegeta has, Goku could become just as powerful as any God of destruction.                  Goku and Vegeta have been friendly rivals since Dragon Ball Z, but Goku has always been the more relied upon fighter between the two. Goku may currently be the strongest fighter, but Vegeta has been making many strides to keep up with his rival counterpart as the series progresses.  RELATED: 10 Best Things About Goku Under Whis' tutelage paired with their constant encounters with stronger foes, Goku and Vegeta have had their work cut out for them. Whis has mentioned the flaws that each fighter possesses and points out that the two are strongest when fused together. If Goku could pick up on some of the qualities that Vegeta has, Goku could become just as powerful as any God of destruction.  10          Having A Sense Of Pride As A Saiyan                 Part of Goku's charm is that he doesn't carry the same level of pride as his warrior race, the Saiyans. By comparison, Vegeta's greatest asset as the ""Prince of all Saiyans"" is his incomparable pride of being one.  Goku learning more about the Saiyans' pride may make him a bit more boastful, but finding confidence in being a natural-born warrior may go a long way in his mentality when fighting. This sense of pride may help Goku take fights a bit more seriously.  9          Being A (Better) Role Model For Your Kids                 Fans of Dragon Ball would agree that Goku hasn't necessarily been around for a good portion of Gohan's youth. Whenever Goku showed up, trouble would soon follow. Vegeta on the other hand has grown to become a great parent and is looked up to by both present and future Trunks. RELATED:Dragon Ball Z: 10 Times Goku Put Himself Before His Family  Goku isn't winning any ""Father Of The Year"" awards compared to Vegeta's level of parenting. Vegeta is shown spending quality time taking care of the kids, and not all time spent with his son Trunks' training.  8          Having Original Attacks                 The Kamehameha and Solar Flare are some of Goku's signature attacks. Sadly, those abilities aren't his original moves. A lot of Goku's moves and abilities were taught to him by teachers he either sought out or ran into. For Goku to be the main protagonist, it's surprising that he doesn't have a move that he has created on his own.  Vegeta has a bunch of special moves, that surprisingly, Goku hasn't taken and made his own. From his famous Galick Gun to Big Bang Attack, Vegeta has mastered many moves that weren't taught to him by Gods or aliens.  7          How To Treat Your Wife                 Why Chi-Chi is still with Goku remains a mystery, but being married to the strongest warrior in the universe must have some perks. However, Vegeta has gone the extra mile and has shown multiple subtle displays of affection to his wife, Bulma, that Goku could take notes on. Vegeta and Bulma may not have started off on the right foot, but Vegeta has shown admiration for his wife's abilities and agitation towards anyone that would bother ""his Bulma."" Vegeta hasn't spent many years away from his family to train in the afterlife and has taken on babysitting the kids whenever his wife asked.  6          Vegeta's Fashion Sense If these two had to do a popularity contest based on style, Vegeta would win every time. Goku has been wearing the same orange gi since Dragon Ball. Dragon Ball GT finally gave him a new gi color, but the style was lacking compared to Vegeta's. The few times Goku has changed, the clothes wouldn't fit him very well, and he has mentioned that he doesn't feel comfortable in clothes that fit him. Maybe give credit to Bulma for Vegeta's trendy clothes, but Vegeta's style doesn't mind taking risks. Remember when Vegeta had a mustache?  5          Showing Respect To Higher Beings                 Goku has been on the verge of ending many lives by just being the whimsical martial artist he is. For someone that can read power levels and sense ki energy, Goku usually lacks formality towards gods and other higher beings that can easily wipe away existences. Vegeta, who is aware of the statuses and legends of these beings, always rolls out the red carpet. RELATED: 10 Times Goku Was Put In His Place In Dragon Ball Although his pride usually overshadows his judgment, Vegeta knows when to be quiet and respectful toward those higher in power. Especially when that power can wipe away or restore a universe. Vegeta provides many meals for Beerus and Whis just to keep the earth safe.  4          Taking Fights More Seriously                 Fans all know the feeling when the Z warriors are about to defeat the enemy, but Goku lets them power up again to turn the tide. Goku never takes his fights seriously until someone dies. He even played around with the likes of Kid Buu's destructive tendencies just to see the extent of his power. Vegeta was a victim of this mentality in the Cell Saga and dearly paid for it. Fast-forward to Vegeta's training with Whis, he has learned to fight at full power regardless of what level his opponent is. Goku has even been told by Whis that he would be stronger if he fought more seriously.  3          Know That All Evil Can't Be Redeemed                 Throughout the series, Goku has met a lot of opponents that later became friends or rivals. Most of his current friends were once conflicts that Goku has to deal with. However, there are some characters that are too evil to be kept alive and have no hope of turning over a new leaf. Vegeta is the opposite and will end an opponent's life without hesitation. Maybe if Goku had Vegeta's standards on what is evil, the majority of Dragon Ball's villains wouldn't be later threats or still trying to destroy the earth.  2          Utilizing Battle Tactics                 Whenever Goku gets into a fight, it's rare to see him thinking with his head. He fights instinctively and doesn't have much of a plan when facing tough opponents. Thanks to his friends and allies, Goku has managed to prevail over foes, but maybe fighting an opponent one-on-one isn't the best idea.

His earliest exploits prove why he's the perfect user of his Devil Fruit.                  The following contains spoilers for the One Piece manga, available in English from Viz Media.   One Piece is once again causing uproar after revealing the truth behind Monkey D. Luffy's Devil Fruit. The one he stole from Shanks during his childhood years has always been thought to be the Gum-Gum Fruit, which gives his body its rubber properties. Throughout the series' long tenure, fans have taken it as a fact since Luffy's abilities check out with the Devil Fruit's description.  In recent chapters of the manga, however, One Piece reveals that Luffy's Devil Fruit is in fact not the Gomu Gomu no Mi but Hito Hito no Mi: Model, Nika. It made its debut when Kaido knocked Luffy out after a long battle, awakening his Devil Fruit abilities. Luffy's Gear Five, which is also believed to be his Devil Fruit awakening, allowed him to execute powerful attacks that are reminiscent of his earlier adventuring days. RELATED: One Piece Characters That Deserve Their Own Series                               Hito Hito no Mi: Model, Nika is modeled on the mythical warrior whom slaves venerated as the Sun God. He was said to be the one who will free them from oppression, but the more notable aspect of this Devil Fruit is the power it grants its user. The Five Elders have even described it as the most ridiculous power in the world, only being limited by the wielder's imagination. Luffy has shown this repeatedly during his most recent fight with Kaido. His attacks have become more outrageous after activating his Gear Five, often applying the properties of rubber not only on himself, but also to his environment and on the other characters.  Even though his attacks are mostly similar to what he usually uses, the effects vary greatly. When Kaido swallowed Luffy, the latter ballooned inside the Emperor's stomach. He also used Kaido's nose as leverage by extending his hands through the dragon's eyes. When Kaido hit Luffy's head with his club, it flattened in the form of the club's surface and remained that way for a bit -- and these are only a few examples of how ridiculous Luffy's power can be. RELATED: Everything We Know About One Piece's Ancient Weapons, the Strongest of Them All                               While Luffy's recent offensive creations have put smiles on One Piece readers' faces, they aren't necessarily surprising. Luffy has a long history of inventing unique and outrageous attacks. He used to be more experimental with his power, often creating at least one comical technique per arc.  During his battle against Crocodile, Luffy expanded his head and attempted to eat the Warlord after realizing none of his attacks were dealing any damage. Similarly, he stole some of Arlong's teeth and used them to bite the Fish-man. These attacks, however, have dwindled after the time skip as One Piece has taken a more serious tone. Nika's revelation brings the series back to its comical root as all of Luffy's absurdity cascades out while in his Gear Five form. Perhaps one attack that will be remembered for years to come is when he used Kaido's dragon form as a jump rope. With bigger wars brewing in One Piece, fans will likely be seeing more of Luffy's greatly-missed inventive genius.

His earliest exploits prove why he's the perfect user of his Devil Fruit.                  The following contains spoilers for the One Piece manga, available in English from Viz Media.   One Piece is once again causing uproar after revealing the truth behind Monkey D. Luffy's Devil Fruit. The one he stole from Shanks during his childhood years has always been thought to be the Gum-Gum Fruit, which gives his body its rubber properties. Throughout the series' long tenure, fans have taken it as a fact since Luffy's abilities check out with the Devil Fruit's description.  In recent chapters of the manga, however, One Piece reveals that Luffy's Devil Fruit is in fact not the Gomu Gomu no Mi but Hito Hito no Mi: Model, Nika. It made its debut when Kaido knocked Luffy out after a long battle, awakening his Devil Fruit abilities. Luffy's Gear Five, which is also believed to be his Devil Fruit awakening, allowed him to execute powerful attacks that are reminiscent of his earlier adventuring days. RELATED: One Piece Characters That Deserve Their Own Series                               Hito Hito no Mi: Model, Nika is modeled on the mythical warrior whom slaves venerated as the Sun God. He was said to be the one who will free them from oppression, but the more notable aspect of this Devil Fruit is the power it grants its user. The Five Elders have even described it as the most ridiculous power in the world, only being limited by the wielder's imagination. Luffy has shown this repeatedly during his most recent fight with Kaido. His attacks have become more outrageous after activating his Gear Five, often applying the properties of rubber not only on himself, but also to his environment and on the other characters.  Even though his attacks are mostly similar to what he usually uses, the effects vary greatly. When Kaido swallowed Luffy, the latter ballooned inside the Emperor's stomach. He also used Kaido's nose as leverage by extending his hands through the dragon's eyes. When Kaido hit Luffy's head with his club, it flattened in the form of the club's surface and remained that way for a bit -- and these are only a few examples of how ridiculous Luffy's power can be. RELATED: Everything We Know About One Piece's Ancient Weapons, the Strongest of Them All                               While Luffy's recent offensive creations have put smiles on One Piece readers' faces, they aren't necessarily surprising. Luffy has a long history of inventing unique and outrageous attacks. He used to be more experimental with his power, often creating at least one comical technique per arc.  During his battle against Crocodile, Luffy expanded his head and attempted to eat the Warlord after realizing none of his attacks were dealing any damage. Similarly, he stole some of Arlong's teeth and used them to bite the Fish-man. These attacks, however, have dwindled after the time skip as One Piece has taken a more serious tone. Nika's revelation brings the series back to its comical root as all of Luffy's absurdity cascades out while in his Gear Five form. Perhaps one attack that will be remembered for years to come is when he used Kaido's dragon form as a jump rope. With bigger wars brewing in One Piece, fans will likely be seeing more of Luffy's greatly-missed inventive genius.

The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4, Episode 28 ""The Dawn of Humanity"", now streaming on Crunchyroll, Funimation and Hulu.   The Attack on Titan Season 4, Part 2 finale ends on a haunting cliffhanger by bringing forth the Rumbling's promised devastation as Eren Jaeger -- in the form of the Founding Titan -- and the wall titans finally reach the continent of Marley, signaling the beginning of a mass genocide.  Since Eren started the Rumbling several episodes back, both Eldians and Marleyans have scrambled for a way to cease the inevitable. However, Hange Zoe had made it clear they wouldn't be able to stop Eren completely. In other words, while the heroes are fighting to the best of their abilities to save the world, at the very least, a portion of the Rumbling will be carried out successfully -- and audiences can see it's only breeding fear and death. The sight of Eren's absurdly large Founding Titan leading the charge is horrific but familiar, paralleling the Colossal Titan's initial attack against Shiganshina back in Episode 1.  Related: Attack on Titan: Eren Lied to Mikasa                                The fall of Shiganshina was not only the inciting incident to kickstart Attack on Titan, but it also lit an unrelenting flame inside Eren that took his character journey to new territories. Back then, Bertholdt Hoover used the powers of the Colossal Titan to break through the gates of Shiganshina, allowing for any lurking titans to invade. Countless people lost their lives, including Eren's mother Carla, who was eaten alive before his very eyes. Grief-stricken and completely outraged, Eren declared that he will ""kill them all"". In this context, ""them"" referred to the Titans and he continues to carry a deep-seeded hatred for them -- but as the series progresses and mysteries are unraveled, Eren's goal to wipe out ""every single one"" now refers to humans rather than Titans.  In the present, Eren has become what he hates most and the irony is nothing short of tragic. Now, his earlier declaration holds new meaning. As it turns out, Titans are merely Eldians -- humans transformed into a monstrous species against their will. The main conflict in Attack on Titan isn't simply mankind vs. titans, but mankind vs. mankind. Eren wants peace for his people, but 2000 years of fighting and xenophobia makes this complicated. As children, Eren, Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert used to dream of a world beyond the walls, with the idea of freedom propelling them forward despite the hardships that awaited them as military personnel. The reality is that past the walls awaited more enemies. This realization was detrimental to them all, but it was Eren who took things a bit too far. Fueled by the memory of his mother's death, Eren initiates the Rumbling to eliminate all of humanity except those on Paradis Island.  Related: Attack on Titan: Floch Wasn't the Only One Eren Told About His Plan                 While the Rumbling is certainly a parallel to the series' start, it's also far more devastating. Instead of one Colossal Titan letting in a tirade of pure Titans to destroy a portion of Paradis Island, Eren leads the charge among an army of Colossal Titans with the intent of destroying the world. While the Marleyans fire off heavy artillery, it quickly proves to be insufficient. Surprisingly, the Wall Titans can swim -- and they swim much faster than they walk. While people aren't being devoured like they were in Episode 1, it's still a slaughter. Soldiers are blown away by pressurized air or melted by the steam exerted by the Titans. The Part 2 finale ends with a shot of a Colossal Titan stepping on the camera, likely implying the fate of the soldiers currently running for their lives. Additionally, like Carla and the victims of Shiganshina, they are dying for reasons they don't fully understand. If that's not enough, the music playing during Eren's attack is a rendition of that which played in Episode 1.  Eren's current belief system in Attack on Titan is twisted, but it's hard to ignore the fact that his beliefs were created by being a victim of circumstance. After first discovering his ability to wield the Attack Titan back in Season 1, Eren wanted to be humanity's hope. But things have changed. The world isn't what he thought it was and by becoming the very thing he once swore to destroy, Eren becomes the world's enemy in the hopes of protecting the people he loves.

09-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.cbr.com/attack-on-titan-s4-p2-parallels-e1/,"Attack on Titan's Season 4, Part 2 Finale Parallels Episode 1","      Home Anime Attack on Titan Season 4 Finale Tragically Parallels Episode 1    Attack on Titan Season 4 Finale Tragically Parallels Episode 1  By Nerissa Rupnarine Published 17 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   The Season 4, Part 2 finale of Attack on Titan ends with major destruction - and a haunting callback to the fall of Shiganshina that started it all.                  The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4, Episode 28 ""The Dawn of Humanity"", now streaming on Crunchyroll, Funimation and Hulu.   The Attack on Titan Season 4, Part 2 finale ends on a haunting cliffhanger by bringing forth the Rumbling's promised devastation as Eren Jaeger -- in the form of the Founding Titan -- and the wall titans finally reach the continent of Marley, signaling the beginning of a mass genocide.  Since Eren started the Rumbling several episodes back, both Eldians and Marleyans have scrambled for a way to cease the inevitable. However, Hange Zoe had made it clear they wouldn't be able to stop Eren completely. In other words, while the heroes are fighting to the best of their abilities to save the world, at the very least, a portion of the Rumbling will be carried out successfully -- and audiences can see it's only breeding fear and death. The sight of Eren's absurdly large Founding Titan leading the charge is horrific but familiar, paralleling the Colossal Titan's initial attack against Shiganshina back in Episode 1.  Related: Attack on Titan: Eren Lied to Mikasa                                The fall of Shiganshina was not only the inciting incident to kickstart Attack on Titan, but it also lit an unrelenting flame inside Eren that took his character journey to new territories. Back then, Bertholdt Hoover used the powers of the Colossal Titan to break through the gates of Shiganshina, allowing for any lurking titans to invade. Countless people lost their lives, including Eren's mother Carla, who was eaten alive before his very eyes. Grief-stricken and completely outraged, Eren declared that he will ""kill them all"". In this context, ""them"" referred to the Titans and he continues to carry a deep-seeded hatred for them -- but as the series progresses and mysteries are unraveled, Eren's goal to wipe out ""every single one"" now refers to humans rather than Titans.  In the present, Eren has become what he hates most and the irony is nothing short of tragic. Now, his earlier declaration holds new meaning. As it turns out, Titans are merely Eldians -- humans transformed into a monstrous species against their will. The main conflict in Attack on Titan isn't simply mankind vs. titans, but mankind vs. mankind. Eren wants peace for his people, but 2000 years of fighting and xenophobia makes this complicated. As children, Eren, Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert used to dream of a world beyond the walls, with the idea of freedom propelling them forward despite the hardships that awaited them as military personnel. The reality is that past the walls awaited more enemies. This realization was detrimental to them all, but it was Eren who took things a bit too far. Fueled by the memory of his mother's death, Eren initiates the Rumbling to eliminate all of humanity except those on Paradis Island.  Related: Attack on Titan: Floch Wasn't the Only One Eren Told About His Plan                 While the Rumbling is certainly a parallel to the series' start, it's also far more devastating. Instead of one Colossal Titan letting in a tirade of pure Titans to destroy a portion of Paradis Island, Eren leads the charge among an army of Colossal Titans with the intent of destroying the world. While the Marleyans fire off heavy artillery, it quickly proves to be insufficient. Surprisingly, the Wall Titans can swim -- and they swim much faster than they walk. While people aren't being devoured like they were in Episode 1, it's still a slaughter. Soldiers are blown away by pressurized air or melted by the steam exerted by the Titans. The Part 2 finale ends with a shot of a Colossal Titan stepping on the camera, likely implying the fate of the soldiers currently running for their lives. Additionally, like Carla and the victims of Shiganshina, they are dying for reasons they don't fully understand. If that's not enough, the music playing during Eren's attack is a rendition of that which played in Episode 1.  Eren's current belief system in Attack on Titan is twisted, but it's hard to ignore the fact that his beliefs were created by being a victim of circumstance. After first discovering his ability to wield the Attack Titan back in Season 1, Eren wanted to be humanity's hope. But things have changed. The world isn't what he thought it was and by becoming the very thing he once swore to destroy, Eren becomes the world's enemy in the hopes of protecting the people he loves.

In a new exclusive clip from the English dub of Attack on Titan: The Final Season - Part 2, Mikasa and Annie question each other's loyalty to Paradis and to Eren.  SPOILERS FOR ATTACK ON TITAN: THE FINAL SEASON - PART 2 FOLLOW: The new clip comes from Episode 84 of the popular dark-fantasy series, which will be available on Crunchyroll on April 10. In the new preview, Annie questions Mikasa, Armin and Connie's ability to fight their former friend and ally, Eren Jaeger. The questioning gets especially heated when Annie pushes Mikasa on her feelings for the series' hero-turned-villain, which causes Mikasa to draw her swords as Annie prepares to transform into her titan form. RELATED: Attack on Titan Reveals the Moment That Solidified Eren's Genocidal Plans    After weeks of speculation from fans, the producers of Attack on Titan confirmed that the show will continue with The Final Season's third act in 2023.

Part 3 will once again be produced by studio MAPPA, who took over production of the series after Wit Studio (Ranking of Kings, Spy x Family) animated the series' first three seasons. While the subtitled simulcast of the season has concluded, Crunchyroll's simuldub of Part 2 is still on-going. Fans who prefer the dubbed version of the series can also watch it on Adult Swim's Toonami programming block.

The final chapter of the manga was released in 2021, and despite an extremely divisive reaction to the finale, the anime adaptation of the series continues to be one of the most popular shows in the world, with one market analyst firm naming The Final Season ""the most in-demand"" show of 2021.  In addition to the current season, all previous seasons of the anime are available for streaming on Crunchyroll. Isayama's complete manga series is available in English from Kodansha USA.

The final chapter of the manga was released in 2021, and despite an extremely divisive reaction to the finale, the anime adaptation of the series continues to be one of the most popular shows in the world, with one market analyst firm naming The Final Season ""the most in-demand"" show of 2021.  In addition to the current season, all previous seasons of the anime are available for streaming on Crunchyroll. Isayama's complete manga series is available in English from Kodansha USA.

Home Anime How Jujutsu Kaisen's Gojo and Nanami Embody the Elder Millennial Psyche    How Jujutsu Kaisen's Gojo and Nanami Embody the Elder Millennial Psyche  By Olufolahan Olowoyeye Published 23 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Drawing their convictions from alienation and resentment, Jujutsu Kaisen's Gojo and Nanami describe the experience of many elder Millennials.                 Two of the most celebrated elements of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen are its nuanced approach to character development and its heavy inspiration from contemporary culture. While the series frequently employs antipathy as a method of character development, instances of convergence in their motivations illustrate another method. This alternative approach is shown by the characters Gojo and Nanami, who, though differing wildly in appearance, behavior and histories, share certain generational quirks reminiscent of elder Millennials.  However, in line with the principal theme of Jujutsu Kaisen -- which illustrates the fundamental role of harnessing negativity in human life and culture -- what brings Gojo and Nanami together is less how they feel, but rather what they ultimately decide to do. In learning to draw conviction from alienation, disillusionment and resentment, Gojo and Nanami together describe a collective arc grounded in Millennial angst. RELATED: How Antipathy Drives Character Development in Jujutsu Kaisen          Kento Nanami: The Shaman Who Overcame His Resignation                 When Kento Nanami leaves Jujutsu sorcery for a traditional corporate job, two realizations follow: a life resigned to the empty pursuit of money stays empty, and that the little asked of workers in his position -- to perpetuate the inequality and absurdity of modern life -- is not enough to live on. The cognitive dissonance of these realizations comes to a head in a bakery where he has a negative epiphany familiar to many Millennials: he doesn’t have to do anything. In essence, like many others in his position, Nanami doesn’t have to make the world better, or do anything of any “real” value; instead, he is only incentivized to perpetuate the same absurdity and despair that feeds curses.  His decision becomes clear: seeing the curse perched on the young woman’s shoulder, he could simply leave her to his fate. His sandwich is already paid for, so their business is over. Any surplus effort he invests is at his own cost. Until this moment, that was a source of despair for Nanami; by choosing to act instead, he renews his conviction and returns to his work. RELATED: Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Delivers a Thrilling & Emotional Prequel That Fans Will Love          Satoru Gojo's Main Character Syndrome                 Contrary to Nanami's gradual alienation in the workplace, Gojo's conviction in Jujutsu Kaisen stems from his personal experience of trauma and betrayal. Reeling from the shock and loss of his experiences with Geto and Yuta in Jujutsu High, Gojo transforms his own emptiness and resentment into a limitless thirst for personal power. While his ambition is in part motivated by a desire to give children like Yuta and Yuji the carefree childhood he lacked, his contempt for the elites of Jujutsu Sorcery adds another layer.  Like Nanami, dissatisfaction with the status quo has led Gojo to lose faith in the leadership and guidance of the previous generation. But unlike Nanami, this disillusionment is abrupt, traumatic and deeply personal, versus the more subtle and protracted disillusionment of working life. Similarly, just as Nanami's dry, straight-laced professionalism contrasts with his deep feeling, Gojo's own laid-back attitude contrasts with his profound megalomania. RELATED: Jujutsu Kaisen Shows What Happens When Three Domain Expansions Overlap Over the course of Jujutsu Kaisen, Gojo's antipathy for his superiors in Jujutsu sorcery -- illustrated by his blatant disrespect for Principal Yorinobu and others -- supplies critical context for his thirst for power and his arrogance. For Gojo, ""being the strongest"" is a role to which only he is truly ""fit,"" in that he can generate and sustain the conviction to do so. Like Nanami, this conviction takes root in alienation and disillusionment with the powers-that-be, but with an important distinction. While Nanami critiques the inhuman priorities of these powers, the source of Gojo's own grievances is their relative weakness.  Though Jujutsu Kaisen's manga and its adaptations alike work to distinguish these characters, their worldviews nevertheless converge in an unsettling, generational intuition: the world is deeply broken, those in charge of it have largely failed, and whatever responsibility to do differently rests solely in one's self.

Two of the most celebrated elements of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen are its nuanced approach to character development and its heavy inspiration from contemporary culture. While the series frequently employs antipathy as a method of character development, instances of convergence in their motivations illustrate another method. This alternative approach is shown by the characters Gojo and Nanami, who, though differing wildly in appearance, behavior and histories, share certain generational quirks reminiscent of elder Millennials.  However, in line with the principal theme of Jujutsu Kaisen -- which illustrates the fundamental role of harnessing negativity in human life and culture -- what brings Gojo and Nanami together is less how they feel, but rather what they ultimately decide to do. In learning to draw conviction from alienation, disillusionment and resentment, Gojo and Nanami together describe a collective arc grounded in Millennial angst. RELATED: How Antipathy Drives Character Development in Jujutsu Kaisen          Kento Nanami: The Shaman Who Overcame His Resignation                 When Kento Nanami leaves Jujutsu sorcery for a traditional corporate job, two realizations follow: a life resigned to the empty pursuit of money stays empty, and that the little asked of workers in his position -- to perpetuate the inequality and absurdity of modern life -- is not enough to live on. The cognitive dissonance of these realizations comes to a head in a bakery where he has a negative epiphany familiar to many Millennials: he doesn’t have to do anything. In essence, like many others in his position, Nanami doesn’t have to make the world better, or do anything of any “real” value; instead, he is only incentivized to perpetuate the same absurdity and despair that feeds curses.  His decision becomes clear: seeing the curse perched on the young woman’s shoulder, he could simply leave her to his fate. His sandwich is already paid for, so their business is over. Any surplus effort he invests is at his own cost. Until this moment, that was a source of despair for Nanami; by choosing to act instead, he renews his conviction and returns to his work. RELATED: Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Delivers a Thrilling & Emotional Prequel That Fans Will Love          Satoru Gojo's Main Character Syndrome                 Contrary to Nanami's gradual alienation in the workplace, Gojo's conviction in Jujutsu Kaisen stems from his personal experience of trauma and betrayal. Reeling from the shock and loss of his experiences with Geto and Yuta in Jujutsu High, Gojo transforms his own emptiness and resentment into a limitless thirst for personal power. While his ambition is in part motivated by a desire to give children like Yuta and Yuji the carefree childhood he lacked, his contempt for the elites of Jujutsu Sorcery adds another layer.  Like Nanami, dissatisfaction with the status quo has led Gojo to lose faith in the leadership and guidance of the previous generation. But unlike Nanami, this disillusionment is abrupt, traumatic and deeply personal, versus the more subtle and protracted disillusionment of working life. Similarly, just as Nanami's dry, straight-laced professionalism contrasts with his deep feeling, Gojo's own laid-back attitude contrasts with his profound megalomania. RELATED: Jujutsu Kaisen Shows What Happens When Three Domain Expansions Overlap Over the course of Jujutsu Kaisen, Gojo's antipathy for his superiors in Jujutsu sorcery -- illustrated by his blatant disrespect for Principal Yorinobu and others -- supplies critical context for his thirst for power and his arrogance. For Gojo, ""being the strongest"" is a role to which only he is truly ""fit,"" in that he can generate and sustain the conviction to do so. Like Nanami, this conviction takes root in alienation and disillusionment with the powers-that-be, but with an important distinction. While Nanami critiques the inhuman priorities of these powers, the source of Gojo's own grievances is their relative weakness.  Though Jujutsu Kaisen's manga and its adaptations alike work to distinguish these characters, their worldviews nevertheless converge in an unsettling, generational intuition: the world is deeply broken, those in charge of it have largely failed, and whatever responsibility to do differently rests solely in one's self.

Chapter 159 clarifies what he really wants to achieve.                  The following contains spoilers for One-Punch Man Chapter 159, ""Source of Anxiety,"" by One, Yusuke Murata, John Werry and James Gaubatz, available in English at Viz Media.   One-Punch Man isn't lacking in characters with interesting power, fighting style or personality. However, not many of them offer depth. Most are simply there for the sake of entertainment, either as a gag or some form of mockery. Garo is one of the few who actually has a story to tell with a respectable background arc -- though his motivations are questionable.  When Garo made his debut, he announced he was siding with the monsters. He claimed to sympathize with the villains and vowed to destroy the heroes. However, his power was still lacking then so he sought to fight stronger opponents to hone himself and his skills. He challenged S-Class heroes and even hospitalized some of them, but he also defeated countless strong monsters and had wholesome moments along the way. One-Punch Man Chapter 159 finally clarifies whether Garo stands on the side of good or evil. RELATED: One-Punch Man: Saitama Just Pulled a Jimbei Move                After Centisennin and Evil Ocean Water were dealt with, Saitama went toward Garo and asked the Hero Hunter what exactly he is. But before he arrived, Garo recalled that the S-Class heroes were knocked out and yet to reappear. He assumed they were out of commission, supposedly meaning he no longer had anything to fear. Garo could finally perfect absolute evil using the martial art form he created. Despite this, he instead felt that there was something he was missing -- then Saitama arrived.  Garo did not recognize Saitama despite having met the bald hero a couple of times previously in One-Punch Man. He took a moment to think about Saitama's question, casting away his master's advice to follow his heart. Resolving himself to accomplish the task that he believed only he could do, he introduced himself as the monster Garo, then followed by claiming to cast all of humanity into the depths of despair and become the absolute evil. RELATED: One-Punch Man: A Dark & Twisted Backstory Led to Genos Becoming a Cyborg                Garo's decision isn't surprising, as he's always been dead set on pursuing the evil path. In fact, it's his primary motivation to get stronger. It's just that One-Punch Man has made it seem that Garo was finally turning over a new leaf. He painstakingly protected the kid Tareo on multiple occasions and even joined hands with Metal Bat -- someone he had a bad history with -- in order to defeat Centisennin. Garo also had some sort of enlightenment after going head-to-head against his former master, which allowed him to regain his humanity.  With Garo cementing his goal to be the ultimate evil, it's probably safe to assume that the only means to make him change his mind is to utterly destroy him.

The following contains spoilers for Platinum End, now streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation, as well as dicsussion of suicide.   Platinum End, a thriller anime by the same creators as Death Note, stars the humble, pacifistic Kakehashi Mirai who aims to simply live a life of ordinary happiness -- and his efforts to win a divine battle royale to decide who will become the world's next God. It takes more than angel wings and red arrows to win this fight.  The story of Platinum End began as a fairly routine battle royale scenario with an angelic theme but soon expanded in scope and explored a variety of intriguing themes about the purpose of life, the cost of taking another life, the meaning of what God really is and far more. And these topics are explored in more than a few wild and unpredictable plot twists along the way. RELATED: Platinum End's Mirai is a Weak Protagonist - and It's Harming the Story          When Nasse Chose Mirai As A God Candidate                 The very first plot twist in Platinum End ranks among the most important. In fact, if it didn't take place, Mirai wouldn't have even been alive to witness the rest of the series. After graduating from middle school, the miserable Mirai was ready to end his own life and attempted to do so by falling off a skyscraper. That was when the playful but brutal angel Nasse literally swooped in to save his life, and Mirai vowed to make the most of what she did for him.  He was then chosen as one of the 13 God candidates who would fight over the throne of Heaven, launching the entire rest of Platinum End. From this point on, Mirai would fight to protect his own life and that of the people around him. Never again will he consider the self-destructive path. RELATED: Platinum End: Was It Muni Who Plotted to [SPOILER] Heaven?          When Mirai's Team Defeated Metropoliman                 Mirai's most powerful rival, the armored would-be hero Metropoliman, was poised to win the entire battle royale with his advanced arrow techniques and devious methods. This included sending his minion Hajime to take Mukaido Nanato's wife and daughter hostage. During the battle, Mirai and Saki finally turned the tables on Metropoliman and restrained him, which gave Mukaido a chance to use the last of his strength to slay the villain with a heavy machine gun.  Metropoliman's death did more than end the threat he posed -- it also shifted the battle royale's tone away from violence and toward debate and philosophical discussion, which is what Mirai preferred. But he wouldn't be the one to take charge of the upcoming debate. RELATED: How Biblically Accurate are the Angels in Platinum End?          When Yuito Susumu Called For A Peaceful Summit                 Not long after Metropoliman's death, the youngest God candidate, Yuito Susumu, made his move. He appeared on live TV and encouraged the remaining candidates to join him in peaceful talks on who should become God and why, a plan Mirai and his ally Saki cautiously agreed to.  This helped shift Platinum End from a battle anime to something more akin to its Death Note progenitor, complete with the use of media, mind games and schemes within schemes. Susumu meant well, but other God candidates such as Nakaumi Shuji and Professor Yoneda would complicate Susumu's efforts to vote peacefully for a new God. Soon, it was Yoneda who ran the show, not Susumu. RELATED: Platinum End: Mirai Prepares for His Final Battle - and He May Have to Kill          When Professor Yoneda Vowed To Kill The God Creature                 The brilliant but reclusive professor Yoneda Gaku, the final God candidate to appear, wanted to end the battle royale in a whole new way. He didn't want to fight and become a classist king like Metropoliman, nor did he desire to vote for a new God. Instead, the cynical Yoneda proposed a shocking new theory: that humans' collective prayers and emotions created God, similar to negative emotions creating curses in Jujutsu Kaisen, and Yoneda didn't want such a false deity to deceive humanity with false hope.  So he hatched a bold plan to slay most other God candidates, then have his ally Nakaumi and himself kill one another to ensure no one won the competition. This would ensure God would never be replaced, and the very idea of this being would die out. RELATED: Platinum End's Professor Yoneda Echoes Hyuga Neji's Darkest Beliefs in Naruto          When Nakaumi Destroyed Himself As God                 In the end, Nakaumi was chosen as the new God and ascended to the heavens as an enlightened being. There, he saw for himself just how many people across the world wanted to end their own lives and he felt powerless to aid them. That, combined with his own self-destructive desires, led God-Nakaumi to destroy himself with a giant white arrow -- then chaos ensued.  This had an apocalyptic impact not just on Platinum End's main characters, but all of humanity and the angels as well. Everyone was wiped out -- but in the end, Mirai and Saki died happily in each other's arms and achieved their true platinum end. They were the winners after all.

Home Anime Sakamoto Days Feels Like It Comes From the '90s - and That's a Good Thing    Sakamoto Days Feels Like It Comes From the '90s - and That's a Good Thing  By Dallas Marshall Published 19 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Sakamoto Days has the feel of a manga from the '90s which may be off-putting to some, but there's more than enough hijinks and action to draw in fans.                 People who come from a history of crime have a lot to deal with. As they do their best to live a clean life, they sometimes have to deal with their former checkered lives, such as vengeful enemies, temptations to make ""easy money"" and old compatriots trying to force them back into their old ways. Most stories surrounding the theme of redemption and trying to escape a life of crime usually end in tragedy, a sad reminder that crime doesn't pay.  Today's manga is anything but sad, serious or a cautionary tale. Sakamoto Days, written by Yuto Suzuki and published by Viz Media, is a silly romp surrounding the life of a former hitman named Sakamoto. He was not just any hitman but the greatest the Yakuza have ever seen. Sakamoto was dashing, deadly and an expert killer. But after starting a family, he is now out of shape and the only trigger he pulls is the one on a bar code scanner since, after leaving his life of crime, he opened a convenience store with his lovely wife and child. While he may have left the underworld behind him, the underworld has not forgotten Sakamoto. A figure from his past comes to his store and makes a request: ""return to the assassin world, or die!""  RELATED: The Director of Escaflowne Was Also Behind This Old-School Sci-Fi Crime Anim                The first noticeable factor about Sakamoto Days is that the art style is reminiscent of Viz Media's 1990s manga. The linework is softer and has less of the in-your-face aesthetics that cover the pages of modern-day manga. Sakamoto Days is a crime story that feels less like the gritty work of such dramas as Gangsta or Black Lagoon and more like a '90s staple such as Fushigi Yugi or Yu Yu Hakusho. While this may be off-putting to some fans of modern manga, the juxtaposition of softness mixed with the plot's challenging crime themes is an amusing dualism.  It is also funny that the jokes are thrown at the reader at a mile-a-minute pace alongside the action, which usually involves Sakamoto dealing with the day-to-day struggles of life like going to the grocery store is as severe as an assassination mission. After all, old habits die hard. However, despite its comedic tones, Sakamoto Days is for an older teen audience and features some violent scenes that should be avoided by the younger readers in the crowd. Luckily for our out-of-shape former criminal, he has a loving family that helps him keep on the straight and narrow. One of the best things about this manga is its main lead characters. Sakamoto's wife, Aoi, is his rock throughout and while she does know of his dark past, she sees the good in him and makes it her life's mission to guide her husband to be the best man he can be.  RELATED: The Best Free Short Manga on Manga Plus                 Love can change a man and Sakamoto Days reminds readers that even those who have the shadiest of histories can find redemption. So, instead of being a hitman for the Yakuza, Sakamoto utilizes his quick reflexes for customer care and community service, even if he gets carried away at times -- much to the chagrin of his wife and readers' amusement. As for some of the secondary characters in this manga, such as fellow former assassin-turned-convenience-store-clerk Shin, not many unique traits can be spoken for. Most of the side characters are, for lack of a better term, just there.  Sakamoto Days does not reinvent the wheel when it comes to comedy manga. The jokes are serviceable, complete with slapstick humor and visual gags that induce chuckles. The action scenes are well put together but will not blow readers' minds. But as a fun diversion with a somewhat retro aesthetic, Sakamoto Days does not need to be revolutionary to be entertaining and sets out to tell a silly story about redemption. It's the white cake of comedy manga: simple, somewhat sweet and direct. In a challenging world such as ours, sometimes folks need some comfort food -- even if it's all about crime and the bloodshed that comes with it.

RELATED: The Director of Escaflowne Was Also Behind This Old-School Sci-Fi Crime Anim                The first noticeable factor about Sakamoto Days is that the art style is reminiscent of Viz Media's 1990s manga. The linework is softer and has less of the in-your-face aesthetics that cover the pages of modern-day manga. Sakamoto Days is a crime story that feels less like the gritty work of such dramas as Gangsta or Black Lagoon and more like a '90s staple such as Fushigi Yugi or Yu Yu Hakusho. While this may be off-putting to some fans of modern manga, the juxtaposition of softness mixed with the plot's challenging crime themes is an amusing dualism.  It is also funny that the jokes are thrown at the reader at a mile-a-minute pace alongside the action, which usually involves Sakamoto dealing with the day-to-day struggles of life like going to the grocery store is as severe as an assassination mission. After all, old habits die hard. However, despite its comedic tones, Sakamoto Days is for an older teen audience and features some violent scenes that should be avoided by the younger readers in the crowd. Luckily for our out-of-shape former criminal, he has a loving family that helps him keep on the straight and narrow. One of the best things about this manga is its main lead characters. Sakamoto's wife, Aoi, is his rock throughout and while she does know of his dark past, she sees the good in him and makes it her life's mission to guide her husband to be the best man he can be.  RELATED: The Best Free Short Manga on Manga Plus                 Love can change a man and Sakamoto Days reminds readers that even those who have the shadiest of histories can find redemption. So, instead of being a hitman for the Yakuza, Sakamoto utilizes his quick reflexes for customer care and community service, even if he gets carried away at times -- much to the chagrin of his wife and readers' amusement. As for some of the secondary characters in this manga, such as fellow former assassin-turned-convenience-store-clerk Shin, not many unique traits can be spoken for. Most of the side characters are, for lack of a better term, just there.  Sakamoto Days does not reinvent the wheel when it comes to comedy manga. The jokes are serviceable, complete with slapstick humor and visual gags that induce chuckles. The action scenes are well put together but will not blow readers' minds. But as a fun diversion with a somewhat retro aesthetic, Sakamoto Days does not need to be revolutionary to be entertaining and sets out to tell a silly story about redemption. It's the white cake of comedy manga: simple, somewhat sweet and direct. In a challenging world such as ours, sometimes folks need some comfort food -- even if it's all about crime and the bloodshed that comes with it.
