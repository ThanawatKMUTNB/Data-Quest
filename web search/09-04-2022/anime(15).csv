Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 Episode 24  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of The Case Study of Vanitas (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5            If you needed a reason not to trust cats, this episode might give it to you. Nothing is explicitly stated, but there's an impressively strong implication that Murr, the grumpy fuzzball who has accompanied Noé this whole time, is actually his teacher, Dominique and Louis' grandfather, and Marquis de Sade himself. Although he says that the form Vanitas has met him in before is that of the Comte de Saint Germaine, there's plenty to indicate that he's holding back a very important truth, which we see in three main ways: his eyes are the same colors as Murr's, he calls everyone “kittens,” and in the last scene we see of Murr, he's walking with a black kitten wearing a blue ribbon…after Monsieur le Comte has taken Mikhaïl away with him.    Yes, Mikhaïl turns up again in battered human form to make one last plea for Vanitas to join him, and yes, “mes chatons” isn't outside the realm of possibility for a vaguely unsettling pet name, but it makes so much sense if he's actually Murr. He has to have been following Vanitas' and Noé's every move to step in when he does, influencing them in subtle ways to steer them to the moment of confrontation with Mikhaïl, or at least making sure that they didn't do something silly like die before his plans come to fruition. Whether or not he's been counting on our heroes forming a bond is up in the air, but if he was, he seems to have known Vanitas better than Vanitas knows himself. It's clear that he's playing a long game, even if his true goal remains uncertain.    But if this final confrontation does anything apart from solidifying Noé's and Vanitas' relationship, that would be to finally make Vanitas start moving forward again. The best symbolism of that is in the final ending theme, where rather than stopping to look back, Vanitas keeps moving forward down the beach with Noé, indicating that he has at long last put the past behind him. His hourglass earring also plays a role, as it has this entire season; the close focus on it when Vanitas explains to Mikhaïl that the dead cannot come back is indicative of the fact that he knows that Luna's time has run out. He can't just flip over the hourglass and bring them back, and perhaps keeping the hourglass charm was his way of remembering that. Time comes for us all, and if Vanitas has been devoted to preventing it from running out of curse-bearers' glasses too fast, he does that because of the one whose time ran out too soon. He doesn't have the childish optimism of Mikhaïl. Instead he's been stuck in anger and regret, and it was Noé and Jeanne who helped him out of it, making him feel things he'd relegated to a box in the corner of his heart. It's not that his goal has changed, but rather that he's got a clearer view of it now, and when he takes Noé's hand in the end, that's him accepting that he has to keep moving forward.    Dominique has a similar moment of self-realization when she's stuck in the greyscale confines of her own mind. She could easily have become another Mikhaïl, but instead she makes the choice to finally take a step out of the past. She's back in mourning when we catch a glimpse of her in the dining room with Jeanne, but maybe this time she'll come out of it naturally, as herself rather than as someone who thinks she needs to give her dead twin's life meaning by living for and as him. Domi deserves to be happy, to have people she loves as herself, and to be her own person. As a child she couldn't process Louis' death; as an adult, and with the help of those who love her, she may be able to start living again – as Dominique de Sade rather than as a shadow of her brother.    Do I wish there was more? Yes, of course, but we've caught up with the manga now and I'd rather wait years for a third season that could follow it as faithfully, because this has been both an extraordinarily good adaptation and a strong story that I want to see continue as the author wrote it. For now the sun has risen after the rain and we can feel secure that Noé, Vanitas, Jeanne, and Domi will all keep moving forward. It's a good place to stop – especially since we know that the story is far from over.

Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 Episode 24  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of The Case Study of Vanitas (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5            If you needed a reason not to trust cats, this episode might give it to you. Nothing is explicitly stated, but there's an impressively strong implication that Murr, the grumpy fuzzball who has accompanied Noé this whole time, is actually his teacher, Dominique and Louis' grandfather, and Marquis de Sade himself. Although he says that the form Vanitas has met him in before is that of the Comte de Saint Germaine, there's plenty to indicate that he's holding back a very important truth, which we see in three main ways: his eyes are the same colors as Murr's, he calls everyone “kittens,” and in the last scene we see of Murr, he's walking with a black kitten wearing a blue ribbon…after Monsieur le Comte has taken Mikhaïl away with him.    Yes, Mikhaïl turns up again in battered human form to make one last plea for Vanitas to join him, and yes, “mes chatons” isn't outside the realm of possibility for a vaguely unsettling pet name, but it makes so much sense if he's actually Murr. He has to have been following Vanitas' and Noé's every move to step in when he does, influencing them in subtle ways to steer them to the moment of confrontation with Mikhaïl, or at least making sure that they didn't do something silly like die before his plans come to fruition. Whether or not he's been counting on our heroes forming a bond is up in the air, but if he was, he seems to have known Vanitas better than Vanitas knows himself. It's clear that he's playing a long game, even if his true goal remains uncertain.    But if this final confrontation does anything apart from solidifying Noé's and Vanitas' relationship, that would be to finally make Vanitas start moving forward again. The best symbolism of that is in the final ending theme, where rather than stopping to look back, Vanitas keeps moving forward down the beach with Noé, indicating that he has at long last put the past behind him. His hourglass earring also plays a role, as it has this entire season; the close focus on it when Vanitas explains to Mikhaïl that the dead cannot come back is indicative of the fact that he knows that Luna's time has run out. He can't just flip over the hourglass and bring them back, and perhaps keeping the hourglass charm was his way of remembering that. Time comes for us all, and if Vanitas has been devoted to preventing it from running out of curse-bearers' glasses too fast, he does that because of the one whose time ran out too soon. He doesn't have the childish optimism of Mikhaïl. Instead he's been stuck in anger and regret, and it was Noé and Jeanne who helped him out of it, making him feel things he'd relegated to a box in the corner of his heart. It's not that his goal has changed, but rather that he's got a clearer view of it now, and when he takes Noé's hand in the end, that's him accepting that he has to keep moving forward.    Dominique has a similar moment of self-realization when she's stuck in the greyscale confines of her own mind. She could easily have become another Mikhaïl, but instead she makes the choice to finally take a step out of the past. She's back in mourning when we catch a glimpse of her in the dining room with Jeanne, but maybe this time she'll come out of it naturally, as herself rather than as someone who thinks she needs to give her dead twin's life meaning by living for and as him. Domi deserves to be happy, to have people she loves as herself, and to be her own person. As a child she couldn't process Louis' death; as an adult, and with the help of those who love her, she may be able to start living again – as Dominique de Sade rather than as a shadow of her brother.    Do I wish there was more? Yes, of course, but we've caught up with the manga now and I'd rather wait years for a third season that could follow it as faithfully, because this has been both an extraordinarily good adaptation and a strong story that I want to see continue as the author wrote it. For now the sun has risen after the rain and we can feel secure that Noé, Vanitas, Jeanne, and Domi will all keep moving forward. It's a good place to stop – especially since we know that the story is far from over.

Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 Episode 24  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of The Case Study of Vanitas (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5            If you needed a reason not to trust cats, this episode might give it to you. Nothing is explicitly stated, but there's an impressively strong implication that Murr, the grumpy fuzzball who has accompanied Noé this whole time, is actually his teacher, Dominique and Louis' grandfather, and Marquis de Sade himself. Although he says that the form Vanitas has met him in before is that of the Comte de Saint Germaine, there's plenty to indicate that he's holding back a very important truth, which we see in three main ways: his eyes are the same colors as Murr's, he calls everyone “kittens,” and in the last scene we see of Murr, he's walking with a black kitten wearing a blue ribbon…after Monsieur le Comte has taken Mikhaïl away with him.    Yes, Mikhaïl turns up again in battered human form to make one last plea for Vanitas to join him, and yes, “mes chatons” isn't outside the realm of possibility for a vaguely unsettling pet name, but it makes so much sense if he's actually Murr. He has to have been following Vanitas' and Noé's every move to step in when he does, influencing them in subtle ways to steer them to the moment of confrontation with Mikhaïl, or at least making sure that they didn't do something silly like die before his plans come to fruition. Whether or not he's been counting on our heroes forming a bond is up in the air, but if he was, he seems to have known Vanitas better than Vanitas knows himself. It's clear that he's playing a long game, even if his true goal remains uncertain.    But if this final confrontation does anything apart from solidifying Noé's and Vanitas' relationship, that would be to finally make Vanitas start moving forward again. The best symbolism of that is in the final ending theme, where rather than stopping to look back, Vanitas keeps moving forward down the beach with Noé, indicating that he has at long last put the past behind him. His hourglass earring also plays a role, as it has this entire season; the close focus on it when Vanitas explains to Mikhaïl that the dead cannot come back is indicative of the fact that he knows that Luna's time has run out. He can't just flip over the hourglass and bring them back, and perhaps keeping the hourglass charm was his way of remembering that. Time comes for us all, and if Vanitas has been devoted to preventing it from running out of curse-bearers' glasses too fast, he does that because of the one whose time ran out too soon. He doesn't have the childish optimism of Mikhaïl. Instead he's been stuck in anger and regret, and it was Noé and Jeanne who helped him out of it, making him feel things he'd relegated to a box in the corner of his heart. It's not that his goal has changed, but rather that he's got a clearer view of it now, and when he takes Noé's hand in the end, that's him accepting that he has to keep moving forward.    Dominique has a similar moment of self-realization when she's stuck in the greyscale confines of her own mind. She could easily have become another Mikhaïl, but instead she makes the choice to finally take a step out of the past. She's back in mourning when we catch a glimpse of her in the dining room with Jeanne, but maybe this time she'll come out of it naturally, as herself rather than as someone who thinks she needs to give her dead twin's life meaning by living for and as him. Domi deserves to be happy, to have people she loves as herself, and to be her own person. As a child she couldn't process Louis' death; as an adult, and with the help of those who love her, she may be able to start living again – as Dominique de Sade rather than as a shadow of her brother.    Do I wish there was more? Yes, of course, but we've caught up with the manga now and I'd rather wait years for a third season that could follow it as faithfully, because this has been both an extraordinarily good adaptation and a strong story that I want to see continue as the author wrote it. For now the sun has risen after the rain and we can feel secure that Noé, Vanitas, Jeanne, and Domi will all keep moving forward. It's a good place to stop – especially since we know that the story is far from over.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Skeleton Knight in Another World   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed. First off, we have the elephant in the room, which is the “Shortest Ever Gap Between A Content Warning And The Content In Question” Award. The literal first shot of this series is of a surprisingly graphic sexual assault, and I don't know what is worse: That the scene is so lascivious and needlessly cruel right off the bat, or that we're forced to watch this twice in a show that is ostensibly a breezy isekai comedy. It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way. And while the actual story is generic as hell, Arc himself makes a pretty good introduction. He's just excited to be in this new world, doesn't think to ask any questions about how it happened, and rolls through every new discovery with an almost infectious zest for fantasy life. It still slows down too much when he's shuffling through his various video game skills, and the world itself is devoid of anything interesting, but I could honestly picture myself following this literal bonehead for a few episodes, especially if the wacky slapstick from the OP animation is an honest promise.    But all that goodwill died once we circled back around to that rape scene. It's just such a lazy, shameless bit of shock-jock writing that stops the episode in its tracks. It exists solely to create some indisputably evil bandits for our hero to gallantly kill, letting him take lives without guilt (literally, the show admits this right after) and gaining him the affection of the victimized waif he saved. It's the same kind of hacky, exploitative garbage that showed up to ruin Sword Art Online every season like clockwork, and it's especially out of place in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. Plus, it's all made even worse when we see the attack from Arc's perspective and know he could have stepped in sooner, but was busy fretting over his chances in a PVP fight and waited until literally the last second. Then once it's over we're right back to silly funtimes with The Bone Boi as he celebrates his new life in this fantasy world, making the entire thing feel like a bad joke.    So congrats to the story for ensuring I'm not going to bother with any more of it. Ya took any charm or fun you managed to generate and threw it in the garbage. If other viewers have more tolerance for this kind of crap writing, maybe it's worth sticking it out and see if this is a one-time aberration. But for me, there's nothing interesting or special enough in the rest of this show to risk sitting through another scene like that.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Do you have a boilerplate isekai story to tell that borrows heavily from about four hundred other similar series? Do you need a way to spice it up and get eyes on your project? Well then, may I suggest not using rape to do that? Skeleton Knight in Another World's first episode opens with a graphic (or at least graphic enough) rape scene that comes back almost shot-for-shot at about the fourteen-minute mark. It does establish that our hero, who is helpfully not the rapist, is a good guy, because he saves Lady Lauren and her maid Rita, but there seems to be no reason to show us the exact same scene of sexual violence twice in the same episode. The opening salvo seems to be a cheap bid to make viewers pay attention, and while I do recall the same scene happening in the source material, that's not an excuse. If your story's not interesting enough to appeal to viewers without shocking them, maybe you should rethink your plot.    That out of the way, the rest of the episode is also a bit shocking – shockingly bland, that is. Arc, the eponymous skeleton knight, fell asleep playing his game and woke up as his character, only he forgot that he went with the skeleton build when he was creating him, so now he's afraid to take his armor off in public. If he wanted to be a bad guy like his bone-related cousin Ainz from Overlord, he'd be all set, but in this story, his character is a holy knight, so the whole skeleton thing is a bit of a problem. So is the fact that everyone sees his ridiculously nice and powerful armor and assumes that he's gainfully employed, because that armor's all he's got and he's hungry. Watching him try to integrate himself into a very run-of-the-mill town is the most amusing part of the episode, because he's both making things up on the fly and getting random backstory assigned to him by townsfolk.    He's also incredibly excited to be having his very own isekai experience, although he doesn't phrase it that way. Arc's disappointed that his new world seems more plain old Medieval than fantasy based on Medieval Europe, and any little bit of fantasy that he can find is thrilling to him, be that an elf, an orc, or the fact that he can use magic. (Why he doesn't use his fire magic to roast himself some food is never answered.) Of course, he teleports himself right off a cliff trying to figure out how to use it, but that actually sounds about right for how this would work.    If the sexual assault had been left out, this would be an okay-ish show. Not innovative, but bland in an inoffensive way. But it does have the rape scene and that is enough to make me say that steering clear is the better option here, because a combination of insipid and offensive doesn't leave this with a whole lot to recommend it.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Skeleton Knight in Another World   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed. First off, we have the elephant in the room, which is the “Shortest Ever Gap Between A Content Warning And The Content In Question” Award. The literal first shot of this series is of a surprisingly graphic sexual assault, and I don't know what is worse: That the scene is so lascivious and needlessly cruel right off the bat, or that we're forced to watch this twice in a show that is ostensibly a breezy isekai comedy. It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way. And while the actual story is generic as hell, Arc himself makes a pretty good introduction. He's just excited to be in this new world, doesn't think to ask any questions about how it happened, and rolls through every new discovery with an almost infectious zest for fantasy life. It still slows down too much when he's shuffling through his various video game skills, and the world itself is devoid of anything interesting, but I could honestly picture myself following this literal bonehead for a few episodes, especially if the wacky slapstick from the OP animation is an honest promise.    But all that goodwill died once we circled back around to that rape scene. It's just such a lazy, shameless bit of shock-jock writing that stops the episode in its tracks. It exists solely to create some indisputably evil bandits for our hero to gallantly kill, letting him take lives without guilt (literally, the show admits this right after) and gaining him the affection of the victimized waif he saved. It's the same kind of hacky, exploitative garbage that showed up to ruin Sword Art Online every season like clockwork, and it's especially out of place in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. Plus, it's all made even worse when we see the attack from Arc's perspective and know he could have stepped in sooner, but was busy fretting over his chances in a PVP fight and waited until literally the last second. Then once it's over we're right back to silly funtimes with The Bone Boi as he celebrates his new life in this fantasy world, making the entire thing feel like a bad joke.    So congrats to the story for ensuring I'm not going to bother with any more of it. Ya took any charm or fun you managed to generate and threw it in the garbage. If other viewers have more tolerance for this kind of crap writing, maybe it's worth sticking it out and see if this is a one-time aberration. But for me, there's nothing interesting or special enough in the rest of this show to risk sitting through another scene like that.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Do you have a boilerplate isekai story to tell that borrows heavily from about four hundred other similar series? Do you need a way to spice it up and get eyes on your project? Well then, may I suggest not using rape to do that? Skeleton Knight in Another World's first episode opens with a graphic (or at least graphic enough) rape scene that comes back almost shot-for-shot at about the fourteen-minute mark. It does establish that our hero, who is helpfully not the rapist, is a good guy, because he saves Lady Lauren and her maid Rita, but there seems to be no reason to show us the exact same scene of sexual violence twice in the same episode. The opening salvo seems to be a cheap bid to make viewers pay attention, and while I do recall the same scene happening in the source material, that's not an excuse. If your story's not interesting enough to appeal to viewers without shocking them, maybe you should rethink your plot.    That out of the way, the rest of the episode is also a bit shocking – shockingly bland, that is. Arc, the eponymous skeleton knight, fell asleep playing his game and woke up as his character, only he forgot that he went with the skeleton build when he was creating him, so now he's afraid to take his armor off in public. If he wanted to be a bad guy like his bone-related cousin Ainz from Overlord, he'd be all set, but in this story, his character is a holy knight, so the whole skeleton thing is a bit of a problem. So is the fact that everyone sees his ridiculously nice and powerful armor and assumes that he's gainfully employed, because that armor's all he's got and he's hungry. Watching him try to integrate himself into a very run-of-the-mill town is the most amusing part of the episode, because he's both making things up on the fly and getting random backstory assigned to him by townsfolk.    He's also incredibly excited to be having his very own isekai experience, although he doesn't phrase it that way. Arc's disappointed that his new world seems more plain old Medieval than fantasy based on Medieval Europe, and any little bit of fantasy that he can find is thrilling to him, be that an elf, an orc, or the fact that he can use magic. (Why he doesn't use his fire magic to roast himself some food is never answered.) Of course, he teleports himself right off a cliff trying to figure out how to use it, but that actually sounds about right for how this would work.    If the sexual assault had been left out, this would be an okay-ish show. Not innovative, but bland in an inoffensive way. But it does have the rape scene and that is enough to make me say that steering clear is the better option here, because a combination of insipid and offensive doesn't leave this with a whole lot to recommend it.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Skeleton Knight in Another World   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed. First off, we have the elephant in the room, which is the “Shortest Ever Gap Between A Content Warning And The Content In Question” Award. The literal first shot of this series is of a surprisingly graphic sexual assault, and I don't know what is worse: That the scene is so lascivious and needlessly cruel right off the bat, or that we're forced to watch this twice in a show that is ostensibly a breezy isekai comedy. It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way. And while the actual story is generic as hell, Arc himself makes a pretty good introduction. He's just excited to be in this new world, doesn't think to ask any questions about how it happened, and rolls through every new discovery with an almost infectious zest for fantasy life. It still slows down too much when he's shuffling through his various video game skills, and the world itself is devoid of anything interesting, but I could honestly picture myself following this literal bonehead for a few episodes, especially if the wacky slapstick from the OP animation is an honest promise.    But all that goodwill died once we circled back around to that rape scene. It's just such a lazy, shameless bit of shock-jock writing that stops the episode in its tracks. It exists solely to create some indisputably evil bandits for our hero to gallantly kill, letting him take lives without guilt (literally, the show admits this right after) and gaining him the affection of the victimized waif he saved. It's the same kind of hacky, exploitative garbage that showed up to ruin Sword Art Online every season like clockwork, and it's especially out of place in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. Plus, it's all made even worse when we see the attack from Arc's perspective and know he could have stepped in sooner, but was busy fretting over his chances in a PVP fight and waited until literally the last second. Then once it's over we're right back to silly funtimes with The Bone Boi as he celebrates his new life in this fantasy world, making the entire thing feel like a bad joke.    So congrats to the story for ensuring I'm not going to bother with any more of it. Ya took any charm or fun you managed to generate and threw it in the garbage. If other viewers have more tolerance for this kind of crap writing, maybe it's worth sticking it out and see if this is a one-time aberration. But for me, there's nothing interesting or special enough in the rest of this show to risk sitting through another scene like that.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Do you have a boilerplate isekai story to tell that borrows heavily from about four hundred other similar series? Do you need a way to spice it up and get eyes on your project? Well then, may I suggest not using rape to do that? Skeleton Knight in Another World's first episode opens with a graphic (or at least graphic enough) rape scene that comes back almost shot-for-shot at about the fourteen-minute mark. It does establish that our hero, who is helpfully not the rapist, is a good guy, because he saves Lady Lauren and her maid Rita, but there seems to be no reason to show us the exact same scene of sexual violence twice in the same episode. The opening salvo seems to be a cheap bid to make viewers pay attention, and while I do recall the same scene happening in the source material, that's not an excuse. If your story's not interesting enough to appeal to viewers without shocking them, maybe you should rethink your plot.    That out of the way, the rest of the episode is also a bit shocking – shockingly bland, that is. Arc, the eponymous skeleton knight, fell asleep playing his game and woke up as his character, only he forgot that he went with the skeleton build when he was creating him, so now he's afraid to take his armor off in public. If he wanted to be a bad guy like his bone-related cousin Ainz from Overlord, he'd be all set, but in this story, his character is a holy knight, so the whole skeleton thing is a bit of a problem. So is the fact that everyone sees his ridiculously nice and powerful armor and assumes that he's gainfully employed, because that armor's all he's got and he's hungry. Watching him try to integrate himself into a very run-of-the-mill town is the most amusing part of the episode, because he's both making things up on the fly and getting random backstory assigned to him by townsfolk.    He's also incredibly excited to be having his very own isekai experience, although he doesn't phrase it that way. Arc's disappointed that his new world seems more plain old Medieval than fantasy based on Medieval Europe, and any little bit of fantasy that he can find is thrilling to him, be that an elf, an orc, or the fact that he can use magic. (Why he doesn't use his fire magic to roast himself some food is never answered.) Of course, he teleports himself right off a cliff trying to figure out how to use it, but that actually sounds about right for how this would work.    If the sexual assault had been left out, this would be an okay-ish show. Not innovative, but bland in an inoffensive way. But it does have the rape scene and that is enough to make me say that steering clear is the better option here, because a combination of insipid and offensive doesn't leave this with a whole lot to recommend it.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Skeleton Knight in Another World   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed. First off, we have the elephant in the room, which is the “Shortest Ever Gap Between A Content Warning And The Content In Question” Award. The literal first shot of this series is of a surprisingly graphic sexual assault, and I don't know what is worse: That the scene is so lascivious and needlessly cruel right off the bat, or that we're forced to watch this twice in a show that is ostensibly a breezy isekai comedy. It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way.

If other viewers have more tolerance for this kind of crap writing, maybe it's worth sticking it out and see if this is a one-time aberration.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Skeleton Knight in Another World   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed. First off, we have the elephant in the room, which is the “Shortest Ever Gap Between A Content Warning And The Content In Question” Award. The literal first shot of this series is of a surprisingly graphic sexual assault, and I don't know what is worse: That the scene is so lascivious and needlessly cruel right off the bat, or that we're forced to watch this twice in a show that is ostensibly a breezy isekai comedy. It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way. And while the actual story is generic as hell, Arc himself makes a pretty good introduction. He's just excited to be in this new world, doesn't think to ask any questions about how it happened, and rolls through every new discovery with an almost infectious zest for fantasy life. It still slows down too much when he's shuffling through his various video game skills, and the world itself is devoid of anything interesting, but I could honestly picture myself following this literal bonehead for a few episodes, especially if the wacky slapstick from the OP animation is an honest promise.    But all that goodwill died once we circled back around to that rape scene. It's just such a lazy, shameless bit of shock-jock writing that stops the episode in its tracks. It exists solely to create some indisputably evil bandits for our hero to gallantly kill, letting him take lives without guilt (literally, the show admits this right after) and gaining him the affection of the victimized waif he saved. It's the same kind of hacky, exploitative garbage that showed up to ruin Sword Art Online every season like clockwork, and it's especially out of place in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. Plus, it's all made even worse when we see the attack from Arc's perspective and know he could have stepped in sooner, but was busy fretting over his chances in a PVP fight and waited until literally the last second. Then once it's over we're right back to silly funtimes with The Bone Boi as he celebrates his new life in this fantasy world, making the entire thing feel like a bad joke.    So congrats to the story for ensuring I'm not going to bother with any more of it. Ya took any charm or fun you managed to generate and threw it in the garbage. If other viewers have more tolerance for this kind of crap writing, maybe it's worth sticking it out and see if this is a one-time aberration. But for me, there's nothing interesting or special enough in the rest of this show to risk sitting through another scene like that.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Do you have a boilerplate isekai story to tell that borrows heavily from about four hundred other similar series? Do you need a way to spice it up and get eyes on your project? Well then, may I suggest not using rape to do that? Skeleton Knight in Another World's first episode opens with a graphic (or at least graphic enough) rape scene that comes back almost shot-for-shot at about the fourteen-minute mark. It does establish that our hero, who is helpfully not the rapist, is a good guy, because he saves Lady Lauren and her maid Rita, but there seems to be no reason to show us the exact same scene of sexual violence twice in the same episode. The opening salvo seems to be a cheap bid to make viewers pay attention, and while I do recall the same scene happening in the source material, that's not an excuse. If your story's not interesting enough to appeal to viewers without shocking them, maybe you should rethink your plot.    That out of the way, the rest of the episode is also a bit shocking – shockingly bland, that is. Arc, the eponymous skeleton knight, fell asleep playing his game and woke up as his character, only he forgot that he went with the skeleton build when he was creating him, so now he's afraid to take his armor off in public. If he wanted to be a bad guy like his bone-related cousin Ainz from Overlord, he'd be all set, but in this story, his character is a holy knight, so the whole skeleton thing is a bit of a problem. So is the fact that everyone sees his ridiculously nice and powerful armor and assumes that he's gainfully employed, because that armor's all he's got and he's hungry. Watching him try to integrate himself into a very run-of-the-mill town is the most amusing part of the episode, because he's both making things up on the fly and getting random backstory assigned to him by townsfolk.    He's also incredibly excited to be having his very own isekai experience, although he doesn't phrase it that way. Arc's disappointed that his new world seems more plain old Medieval than fantasy based on Medieval Europe, and any little bit of fantasy that he can find is thrilling to him, be that an elf, an orc, or the fact that he can use magic. (Why he doesn't use his fire magic to roast himself some food is never answered.) Of course, he teleports himself right off a cliff trying to figure out how to use it, but that actually sounds about right for how this would work.    If the sexual assault had been left out, this would be an okay-ish show. Not innovative, but bland in an inoffensive way. But it does have the rape scene and that is enough to make me say that steering clear is the better option here, because a combination of insipid and offensive doesn't leave this with a whole lot to recommend it.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

Then once it's over we're right back to silly funtimes with The Bone Boi as he celebrates his new life in this fantasy world, making the entire thing feel like a bad joke.    So congrats to the story for ensuring I'm not going to bother with any more of it. Ya took any charm or fun you managed to generate and threw it in the garbage. If other viewers have more tolerance for this kind of crap writing, maybe it's worth sticking it out and see if this is a one-time aberration. But for me, there's nothing interesting or special enough in the rest of this show to risk sitting through another scene like that.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Do you have a boilerplate isekai story to tell that borrows heavily from about four hundred other similar series? Do you need a way to spice it up and get eyes on your project? Well then, may I suggest not using rape to do that? Skeleton Knight in Another World's first episode opens with a graphic (or at least graphic enough) rape scene that comes back almost shot-for-shot at about the fourteen-minute mark. It does establish that our hero, who is helpfully not the rapist, is a good guy, because he saves Lady Lauren and her maid Rita, but there seems to be no reason to show us the exact same scene of sexual violence twice in the same episode. The opening salvo seems to be a cheap bid to make viewers pay attention, and while I do recall the same scene happening in the source material, that's not an excuse. If your story's not interesting enough to appeal to viewers without shocking them, maybe you should rethink your plot.    That out of the way, the rest of the episode is also a bit shocking – shockingly bland, that is. Arc, the eponymous skeleton knight, fell asleep playing his game and woke up as his character, only he forgot that he went with the skeleton build when he was creating him, so now he's afraid to take his armor off in public. If he wanted to be a bad guy like his bone-related cousin Ainz from Overlord, he'd be all set, but in this story, his character is a holy knight, so the whole skeleton thing is a bit of a problem. So is the fact that everyone sees his ridiculously nice and powerful armor and assumes that he's gainfully employed, because that armor's all he's got and he's hungry. Watching him try to integrate himself into a very run-of-the-mill town is the most amusing part of the episode, because he's both making things up on the fly and getting random backstory assigned to him by townsfolk.    He's also incredibly excited to be having his very own isekai experience, although he doesn't phrase it that way. Arc's disappointed that his new world seems more plain old Medieval than fantasy based on Medieval Europe, and any little bit of fantasy that he can find is thrilling to him, be that an elf, an orc, or the fact that he can use magic. (Why he doesn't use his fire magic to roast himself some food is never answered.) Of course, he teleports himself right off a cliff trying to figure out how to use it, but that actually sounds about right for how this would work.    If the sexual assault had been left out, this would be an okay-ish show. Not innovative, but bland in an inoffensive way. But it does have the rape scene and that is enough to make me say that steering clear is the better option here, because a combination of insipid and offensive doesn't leave this with a whole lot to recommend it.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 3.4              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed. First off, we have the elephant in the room, which is the “Shortest Ever Gap Between A Content Warning And The Content In Question” Award. The literal first shot of this series is of a surprisingly graphic sexual assault, and I don't know what is worse: That the scene is so lascivious and needlessly cruel right off the bat, or that we're forced to watch this twice in a show that is ostensibly a breezy isekai comedy. It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way. And while the actual story is generic as hell, Arc himself makes a pretty good introduction. He's just excited to be in this new world, doesn't think to ask any questions about how it happened, and rolls through every new discovery with an almost infectious zest for fantasy life. It still slows down too much when he's shuffling through his various video game skills, and the world itself is devoid of anything interesting, but I could honestly picture myself following this literal bonehead for a few episodes, especially if the wacky slapstick from the OP animation is an honest promise.    But all that goodwill died once we circled back around to that rape scene. It's just such a lazy, shameless bit of shock-jock writing that stops the episode in its tracks. It exists solely to create some indisputably evil bandits for our hero to gallantly kill, letting him take lives without guilt (literally, the show admits this right after) and gaining him the affection of the victimized waif he saved. It's the same kind of hacky, exploitative garbage that showed up to ruin Sword Art Online every season like clockwork, and it's especially out of place in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. Plus, it's all made even worse when we see the attack from Arc's perspective and know he could have stepped in sooner, but was busy fretting over his chances in a PVP fight and waited until literally the last second.

If your story's not interesting enough to appeal to viewers without shocking them, maybe you should rethink your plot.    That out of the way, the rest of the episode is also a bit shocking – shockingly bland, that is. Arc, the eponymous skeleton knight, fell asleep playing his game and woke up as his character, only he forgot that he went with the skeleton build when he was creating him, so now he's afraid to take his armor off in public. If he wanted to be a bad guy like his bone-related cousin Ainz from Overlord, he'd be all set, but in this story, his character is a holy knight, so the whole skeleton thing is a bit of a problem. So is the fact that everyone sees his ridiculously nice and powerful armor and assumes that he's gainfully employed, because that armor's all he's got and he's hungry. Watching him try to integrate himself into a very run-of-the-mill town is the most amusing part of the episode, because he's both making things up on the fly and getting random backstory assigned to him by townsfolk.    He's also incredibly excited to be having his very own isekai experience, although he doesn't phrase it that way. Arc's disappointed that his new world seems more plain old Medieval than fantasy based on Medieval Europe, and any little bit of fantasy that he can find is thrilling to him, be that an elf, an orc, or the fact that he can use magic. (Why he doesn't use his fire magic to roast himself some food is never answered.) Of course, he teleports himself right off a cliff trying to figure out how to use it, but that actually sounds about right for how this would work.    If the sexual assault had been left out, this would be an okay-ish show. Not innovative, but bland in an inoffensive way. But it does have the rape scene and that is enough to make me say that steering clear is the better option here, because a combination of insipid and offensive doesn't leave this with a whole lot to recommend it.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 3.4              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed. First off, we have the elephant in the room, which is the “Shortest Ever Gap Between A Content Warning And The Content In Question” Award. The literal first shot of this series is of a surprisingly graphic sexual assault, and I don't know what is worse: That the scene is so lascivious and needlessly cruel right off the bat, or that we're forced to watch this twice in a show that is ostensibly a breezy isekai comedy. It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way. And while the actual story is generic as hell, Arc himself makes a pretty good introduction. He's just excited to be in this new world, doesn't think to ask any questions about how it happened, and rolls through every new discovery with an almost infectious zest for fantasy life. It still slows down too much when he's shuffling through his various video game skills, and the world itself is devoid of anything interesting, but I could honestly picture myself following this literal bonehead for a few episodes, especially if the wacky slapstick from the OP animation is an honest promise.    But all that goodwill died once we circled back around to that rape scene. It's just such a lazy, shameless bit of shock-jock writing that stops the episode in its tracks. It exists solely to create some indisputably evil bandits for our hero to gallantly kill, letting him take lives without guilt (literally, the show admits this right after) and gaining him the affection of the victimized waif he saved. It's the same kind of hacky, exploitative garbage that showed up to ruin Sword Art Online every season like clockwork, and it's especially out of place in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. Plus, it's all made even worse when we see the attack from Arc's perspective and know he could have stepped in sooner, but was busy fretting over his chances in a PVP fight and waited until literally the last second. Then once it's over we're right back to silly funtimes with The Bone Boi as he celebrates his new life in this fantasy world, making the entire thing feel like a bad joke.    So congrats to the story for ensuring I'm not going to bother with any more of it. Ya took any charm or fun you managed to generate and threw it in the garbage. If other viewers have more tolerance for this kind of crap writing, maybe it's worth sticking it out and see if this is a one-time aberration. But for me, there's nothing interesting or special enough in the rest of this show to risk sitting through another scene like that.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Do you have a boilerplate isekai story to tell that borrows heavily from about four hundred other similar series? Do you need a way to spice it up and get eyes on your project? Well then, may I suggest not using rape to do that? Skeleton Knight in Another World's first episode opens with a graphic (or at least graphic enough) rape scene that comes back almost shot-for-shot at about the fourteen-minute mark. It does establish that our hero, who is helpfully not the rapist, is a good guy, because he saves Lady Lauren and her maid Rita, but there seems to be no reason to show us the exact same scene of sexual violence twice in the same episode. The opening salvo seems to be a cheap bid to make viewers pay attention, and while I do recall the same scene happening in the source material, that's not an excuse.

Community score: 3.4              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed. First off, we have the elephant in the room, which is the “Shortest Ever Gap Between A Content Warning And The Content In Question” Award. The literal first shot of this series is of a surprisingly graphic sexual assault, and I don't know what is worse: That the scene is so lascivious and needlessly cruel right off the bat, or that we're forced to watch this twice in a show that is ostensibly a breezy isekai comedy. It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way. And while the actual story is generic as hell, Arc himself makes a pretty good introduction. He's just excited to be in this new world, doesn't think to ask any questions about how it happened, and rolls through every new discovery with an almost infectious zest for fantasy life. It still slows down too much when he's shuffling through his various video game skills, and the world itself is devoid of anything interesting, but I could honestly picture myself following this literal bonehead for a few episodes, especially if the wacky slapstick from the OP animation is an honest promise.    But all that goodwill died once we circled back around to that rape scene. It's just such a lazy, shameless bit of shock-jock writing that stops the episode in its tracks. It exists solely to create some indisputably evil bandits for our hero to gallantly kill, letting him take lives without guilt (literally, the show admits this right after) and gaining him the affection of the victimized waif he saved. It's the same kind of hacky, exploitative garbage that showed up to ruin Sword Art Online every season like clockwork, and it's especially out of place in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. Plus, it's all made even worse when we see the attack from Arc's perspective and know he could have stepped in sooner, but was busy fretting over his chances in a PVP fight and waited until literally the last second. Then once it's over we're right back to silly funtimes with The Bone Boi as he celebrates his new life in this fantasy world, making the entire thing feel like a bad joke.    So congrats to the story for ensuring I'm not going to bother with any more of it. Ya took any charm or fun you managed to generate and threw it in the garbage. If other viewers have more tolerance for this kind of crap writing, maybe it's worth sticking it out and see if this is a one-time aberration. But for me, there's nothing interesting or special enough in the rest of this show to risk sitting through another scene like that.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Do you have a boilerplate isekai story to tell that borrows heavily from about four hundred other similar series? Do you need a way to spice it up and get eyes on your project? Well then, may I suggest not using rape to do that? Skeleton Knight in Another World's first episode opens with a graphic (or at least graphic enough) rape scene that comes back almost shot-for-shot at about the fourteen-minute mark. It does establish that our hero, who is helpfully not the rapist, is a good guy, because he saves Lady Lauren and her maid Rita, but there seems to be no reason to show us the exact same scene of sexual violence twice in the same episode. The opening salvo seems to be a cheap bid to make viewers pay attention, and while I do recall the same scene happening in the source material, that's not an excuse. If your story's not interesting enough to appeal to viewers without shocking them, maybe you should rethink your plot.    That out of the way, the rest of the episode is also a bit shocking – shockingly bland, that is. Arc, the eponymous skeleton knight, fell asleep playing his game and woke up as his character, only he forgot that he went with the skeleton build when he was creating him, so now he's afraid to take his armor off in public. If he wanted to be a bad guy like his bone-related cousin Ainz from Overlord, he'd be all set, but in this story, his character is a holy knight, so the whole skeleton thing is a bit of a problem. So is the fact that everyone sees his ridiculously nice and powerful armor and assumes that he's gainfully employed, because that armor's all he's got and he's hungry. Watching him try to integrate himself into a very run-of-the-mill town is the most amusing part of the episode, because he's both making things up on the fly and getting random backstory assigned to him by townsfolk.    He's also incredibly excited to be having his very own isekai experience, although he doesn't phrase it that way. Arc's disappointed that his new world seems more plain old Medieval than fantasy based on Medieval Europe, and any little bit of fantasy that he can find is thrilling to him, be that an elf, an orc, or the fact that he can use magic. (Why he doesn't use his fire magic to roast himself some food is never answered.) Of course, he teleports himself right off a cliff trying to figure out how to use it, but that actually sounds about right for how this would work.    If the sexual assault had been left out, this would be an okay-ish show. Not innovative, but bland in an inoffensive way.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine.

To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine.

09-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/arifureta-from-commonplace-to-world-strongest-season-2/episode-12/.184247,Episode 12 - Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.    Rating:                 Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 is currently streaming on Funimation.

Justin breaks down the grueling work of an anime producer. ―  Mikosh asked: I noticed that anime have different kinds of producers listed in their credits, like executive producers, producers, animation producers, etc. So what is the job of each one of them and in what way each producer impacts the pro...                           column          35 comments       Answerman - How Much Of The Doujinshi Scene Is Porn?   2019 Aug 15, 02:00 35 comments                 manga    Over 700,000 attendees visited Comiket this year, the mecca of self-published comics.

For starters, “lolicon” or “roricon” is short for “Lolita Complex.” “Lolita” as a term for an under-age girl comes from the book of the same name by Vladimir Nabokov.

Justin looks back on old video rooms and industry panels to find out. ―  Fred asked: I've only been going to conventions for the past year or so, and I'm curious how they've evolved over time. You'd actually be surprised by how little has changed for anime conventions over the years.

Choro-gon☆ Breath Shooting Game in English   posted on 2022-04-06 01:30 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra         Game launches for PS4, Switch in N. America in summer 2022    Aksys Games announced on Tuesday that Kaminari Games' Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon Sakuretsu!! Chorogon Breath, the scrolling shoot 'em up game based on Coolkyoushinja's Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid (Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon) manga, will launch in English for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch in North America in summer 2022.    Aksys Games describes the story:  After receiving a cryptic email, Miss Kobayashi and her maids go to Takiya's house to investigate. There they are mysteriously (and overdramatically, let's face it) sucked into the PC.  The game launched in Japan for PS4 and Switch on March 24.    The limited first edition of the physical packaged edition includes a guidebook, bonus exclusive manga by four creators, and a Weiß Schwarz PR card in an exclusive illustrated box.     Kaminari Games is a subsidiary of Moss, who is best known for developing the Raiden series of scrolling shooters. Kaminari Games worked on the Switch version of Raiden V.    Coolkyoushinja began the ongoing Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid manga in the inaugural issue of Monthly Action magazine in May 2013.    Seven Seas Entertainment is releasing the manga in English.    The series inspired an anime adaptation by Kyoto Animation that premiered in Japan in January 2017. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Funimation streamed an English dub. Funimation released the anime on Blu-ray Disc and DVD in April 2020.    Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid S, the anime's second season, premiered in July 2021. Crunchyroll streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and Funiamtion is streaming an English dub. The anime got a special ""Volume S"" on Blu-ray Disc and DVD that will includes an unaired episode titled ""Nippon no Omotenashi (Attend wa Dragon Desu)"" (Japanese Hospitality (My Attendant Is a Dragon)). Volume S shipped on January 19.

Choro-gon☆ Breath Shooting Game in English   posted on 2022-04-06 01:30 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra         Game launches for PS4, Switch in N. America in summer 2022    Aksys Games announced on Tuesday that Kaminari Games' Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon Sakuretsu!! Chorogon Breath, the scrolling shoot 'em up game based on Coolkyoushinja's Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid (Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon) manga, will launch in English for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch in North America in summer 2022.    Aksys Games describes the story:  After receiving a cryptic email, Miss Kobayashi and her maids go to Takiya's house to investigate. There they are mysteriously (and overdramatically, let's face it) sucked into the PC.  The game launched in Japan for PS4 and Switch on March 24.    The limited first edition of the physical packaged edition includes a guidebook, bonus exclusive manga by four creators, and a Weiß Schwarz PR card in an exclusive illustrated box.     Kaminari Games is a subsidiary of Moss, who is best known for developing the Raiden series of scrolling shooters. Kaminari Games worked on the Switch version of Raiden V.    Coolkyoushinja began the ongoing Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid manga in the inaugural issue of Monthly Action magazine in May 2013.    Seven Seas Entertainment is releasing the manga in English.    The series inspired an anime adaptation by Kyoto Animation that premiered in Japan in January 2017. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Funimation streamed an English dub. Funimation released the anime on Blu-ray Disc and DVD in April 2020.    Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid S, the anime's second season, premiered in July 2021. Crunchyroll streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and Funiamtion is streaming an English dub. The anime got a special ""Volume S"" on Blu-ray Disc and DVD that will includes an unaired episode titled ""Nippon no Omotenashi (Attend wa Dragon Desu)"" (Japanese Hospitality (My Attendant Is a Dragon)). Volume S shipped on January 19.

Choro-gon☆ Breath Shooting Game in English   posted on 2022-04-06 01:30 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra         Game launches for PS4, Switch in N. America in summer 2022    Aksys Games announced on Tuesday that Kaminari Games' Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon Sakuretsu!! Chorogon Breath, the scrolling shoot 'em up game based on Coolkyoushinja's Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid (Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon) manga, will launch in English for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch in North America in summer 2022.    Aksys Games describes the story:  After receiving a cryptic email, Miss Kobayashi and her maids go to Takiya's house to investigate. There they are mysteriously (and overdramatically, let's face it) sucked into the PC.  The game launched in Japan for PS4 and Switch on March 24.    The limited first edition of the physical packaged edition includes a guidebook, bonus exclusive manga by four creators, and a Weiß Schwarz PR card in an exclusive illustrated box.     Kaminari Games is a subsidiary of Moss, who is best known for developing the Raiden series of scrolling shooters. Kaminari Games worked on the Switch version of Raiden V.    Coolkyoushinja began the ongoing Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid manga in the inaugural issue of Monthly Action magazine in May 2013.    Seven Seas Entertainment is releasing the manga in English.    The series inspired an anime adaptation by Kyoto Animation that premiered in Japan in January 2017. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Funimation streamed an English dub. Funimation released the anime on Blu-ray Disc and DVD in April 2020.    Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid S, the anime's second season, premiered in July 2021. Crunchyroll streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and Funiamtion is streaming an English dub. The anime got a special ""Volume S"" on Blu-ray Disc and DVD that will includes an unaired episode titled ""Nippon no Omotenashi (Attend wa Dragon Desu)"" (Japanese Hospitality (My Attendant Is a Dragon)). Volume S shipped on January 19.

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.  But at any rate it seems to have been a great boon for SNK these past few years.

People aren't just upset about this because they think the games will be censored (although yes, that would suck), it's due to now being majority owned by a prince who blatantly had a journalist murdered. It doesn't really have anything to do with what is in SNK games right now. This isn't overlooking how it sucks that Tencent is buying up so much everywhere, it's just recognizing how much this instance sucks in a very particular way.

I don't know where you got this idea. PS4 is actually the best version of the game currently. PS5 has too much input lag, XBox is a graveyard, and PC is rife with issues with much of it being related to matchmaking.

You can still like it, it's not like that prince made the game himself to promote him. You can for example buy it used later to reduce amount of money that goes to his company. Or change nothing - China is horrible too and most of us still buy a ton things from them, it's not like you have a duty to boycott everything.

Yeah, when there was the initial announcement of the Saudi prince a couple of years ago, I initially had the same ""No! SNK might as well be dead!"" reaction. But then, over time, I remembered that thinking of it that way would be a disservice to the actual employees at SNK, who had absolutely no control over any of this. Sure, some of them could just leave SNK & go elsewhere, and I'm sure some of them did just that, but those who are still at SNK are giving it their all to produce the best products they can, and most agree that current SNK is in fact doing just that.   It really sucks that supporting those people at SNK who are truly trying their hardest also means technically that some of that money will eventually make its way to someone who shouldn't get any of that support. Unfortunately, if you really trace things down that much, it's more than likely that the wide majority of money that people spend on almost anything goes to terrible, horrible people, because so much of today's various industries are in the hands of those very people.   [quote=""TranceLimit174""]My questions are: who is shaking hands / putting ink to paper to make this deal happen? Is SNK in a position to say no to the investment? Is this a pure economic buyout where you can't really say no?   The actual people who work at SNK have absolutely no say regarding any of this, sadly. Once SNK's original founder Eikichi Kawasaki sold the company off to Leyou in 2016, everyone working there was stuck working for whoever bought it, and they can either leave & go elsewhere or stay & just try to make the best of a bad situation that they can only hope won't affect their ability to develop video games.

All the Saudi Princes I know in the gaming scene (there's surprisingly a few) have all been pretty cool guys either funding DOTA anime or donating to cool Twitch streamers. Apparently Mohammed bin Salman has a Steam profile people found and it's full of Nekopara and Neptunia stuff which signifies him as a man of culture.  Hopefully that means SNK is in good hands.

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.  But at any rate it seems to have been a great boon for SNK these past few years.

People aren't just upset about this because they think the games will be censored (although yes, that would suck), it's due to now being majority owned by a prince who blatantly had a journalist murdered. It doesn't really have anything to do with what is in SNK games right now. This isn't overlooking how it sucks that Tencent is buying up so much everywhere, it's just recognizing how much this instance sucks in a very particular way.

I don't know where you got this idea. PS4 is actually the best version of the game currently. PS5 has too much input lag, XBox is a graveyard, and PC is rife with issues with much of it being related to matchmaking.

You can still like it, it's not like that prince made the game himself to promote him. You can for example buy it used later to reduce amount of money that goes to his company. Or change nothing - China is horrible too and most of us still buy a ton things from them, it's not like you have a duty to boycott everything.

Yeah, when there was the initial announcement of the Saudi prince a couple of years ago, I initially had the same ""No! SNK might as well be dead!"" reaction. But then, over time, I remembered that thinking of it that way would be a disservice to the actual employees at SNK, who had absolutely no control over any of this. Sure, some of them could just leave SNK & go elsewhere, and I'm sure some of them did just that, but those who are still at SNK are giving it their all to produce the best products they can, and most agree that current SNK is in fact doing just that.   It really sucks that supporting those people at SNK who are truly trying their hardest also means technically that some of that money will eventually make its way to someone who shouldn't get any of that support. Unfortunately, if you really trace things down that much, it's more than likely that the wide majority of money that people spend on almost anything goes to terrible, horrible people, because so much of today's various industries are in the hands of those very people.   [quote=""TranceLimit174""]My questions are: who is shaking hands / putting ink to paper to make this deal happen? Is SNK in a position to say no to the investment? Is this a pure economic buyout where you can't really say no?   The actual people who work at SNK have absolutely no say regarding any of this, sadly. Once SNK's original founder Eikichi Kawasaki sold the company off to Leyou in 2016, everyone working there was stuck working for whoever bought it, and they can either leave & go elsewhere or stay & just try to make the best of a bad situation that they can only hope won't affect their ability to develop video games.

All the Saudi Princes I know in the gaming scene (there's surprisingly a few) have all been pretty cool guys either funding DOTA anime or donating to cool Twitch streamers. Apparently Mohammed bin Salman has a Steam profile people found and it's full of Nekopara and Neptunia stuff which signifies him as a man of culture.  Hopefully that means SNK is in good hands.

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.  But at any rate it seems to have been a great boon for SNK these past few years.

People aren't just upset about this because they think the games will be censored (although yes, that would suck), it's due to now being majority owned by a prince who blatantly had a journalist murdered. It doesn't really have anything to do with what is in SNK games right now. This isn't overlooking how it sucks that Tencent is buying up so much everywhere, it's just recognizing how much this instance sucks in a very particular way.

I don't know where you got this idea. PS4 is actually the best version of the game currently. PS5 has too much input lag, XBox is a graveyard, and PC is rife with issues with much of it being related to matchmaking.

You can still like it, it's not like that prince made the game himself to promote him. You can for example buy it used later to reduce amount of money that goes to his company. Or change nothing - China is horrible too and most of us still buy a ton things from them, it's not like you have a duty to boycott everything.

Yeah, when there was the initial announcement of the Saudi prince a couple of years ago, I initially had the same ""No! SNK might as well be dead!"" reaction. But then, over time, I remembered that thinking of it that way would be a disservice to the actual employees at SNK, who had absolutely no control over any of this. Sure, some of them could just leave SNK & go elsewhere, and I'm sure some of them did just that, but those who are still at SNK are giving it their all to produce the best products they can, and most agree that current SNK is in fact doing just that.   It really sucks that supporting those people at SNK who are truly trying their hardest also means technically that some of that money will eventually make its way to someone who shouldn't get any of that support. Unfortunately, if you really trace things down that much, it's more than likely that the wide majority of money that people spend on almost anything goes to terrible, horrible people, because so much of today's various industries are in the hands of those very people.   [quote=""TranceLimit174""]My questions are: who is shaking hands / putting ink to paper to make this deal happen? Is SNK in a position to say no to the investment? Is this a pure economic buyout where you can't really say no?   The actual people who work at SNK have absolutely no say regarding any of this, sadly. Once SNK's original founder Eikichi Kawasaki sold the company off to Leyou in 2016, everyone working there was stuck working for whoever bought it, and they can either leave & go elsewhere or stay & just try to make the best of a bad situation that they can only hope won't affect their ability to develop video games.

All the Saudi Princes I know in the gaming scene (there's surprisingly a few) have all been pretty cool guys either funding DOTA anime or donating to cool Twitch streamers. Apparently Mohammed bin Salman has a Steam profile people found and it's full of Nekopara and Neptunia stuff which signifies him as a man of culture.  Hopefully that means SNK is in good hands.

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.  But at any rate it seems to have been a great boon for SNK these past few years.

Yeah, when there was the initial announcement of the Saudi prince a couple of years ago, I initially had the same ""No! SNK might as well be dead!"" reaction. But then, over time, I remembered that thinking of it that way would be a disservice to the actual employees at SNK, who had absolutely no control over any of this. Sure, some of them could just leave SNK & go elsewhere, and I'm sure some of them did just that, but those who are still at SNK are giving it their all to produce the best products they can, and most agree that current SNK is in fact doing just that.   It really sucks that supporting those people at SNK who are truly trying their hardest also means technically that some of that money will eventually make its way to someone who shouldn't get any of that support. Unfortunately, if you really trace things down that much, it's more than likely that the wide majority of money that people spend on almost anything goes to terrible, horrible people, because so much of today's various industries are in the hands of those very people.   [quote=""TranceLimit174""]My questions are: who is shaking hands / putting ink to paper to make this deal happen? Is SNK in a position to say no to the investment? Is this a pure economic buyout where you can't really say no?   The actual people who work at SNK have absolutely no say regarding any of this, sadly. Once SNK's original founder Eikichi Kawasaki sold the company off to Leyou in 2016, everyone working there was stuck working for whoever bought it, and they can either leave & go elsewhere or stay & just try to make the best of a bad situation that they can only hope won't affect their ability to develop video games.

All the Saudi Princes I know in the gaming scene (there's surprisingly a few) have all been pretty cool guys either funding DOTA anime or donating to cool Twitch streamers. Apparently Mohammed bin Salman has a Steam profile people found and it's full of Nekopara and Neptunia stuff which signifies him as a man of culture.  Hopefully that means SNK is in good hands.

Or change nothing - China is horrible too and most of us still buy a ton things from them, it's not like you have a duty to boycott everything.

Yeah, when there was the initial announcement of the Saudi prince a couple of years ago, I initially had the same ""No! SNK might as well be dead!"" reaction. But then, over time, I remembered that thinking of it that way would be a disservice to the actual employees at SNK, who had absolutely no control over any of this. Sure, some of them could just leave SNK & go elsewhere, and I'm sure some of them did just that, but those who are still at SNK are giving it their all to produce the best products they can, and most agree that current SNK is in fact doing just that.   It really sucks that supporting those people at SNK who are truly trying their hardest also means technically that some of that money will eventually make its way to someone who shouldn't get any of that support. Unfortunately, if you really trace things down that much, it's more than likely that the wide majority of money that people spend on almost anything goes to terrible, horrible people, because so much of today's various industries are in the hands of those very people.

Is this a pure economic buyout where you can't really say no?   The actual people who work at SNK have absolutely no say regarding any of this, sadly. Once SNK's original founder Eikichi Kawasaki sold the company off to Leyou in 2016, everyone working there was stuck working for whoever bought it, and they can either leave & go elsewhere or stay & just try to make the best of a bad situation that they can only hope won't affect their ability to develop video games.

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.

Or change nothing - China is horrible too and most of us still buy a ton things from them, it's not like you have a duty to boycott everything.            Yeah, when there was the initial announcement of the Saudi prince a couple of years ago, I initially had the same ""No! SNK might as well be dead!"" reaction. But then, over time, I remembered that thinking of it that way would be a disservice to the actual employees at SNK, who had absolutely no control over any of this. Sure, some of them could just leave SNK & go elsewhere, and I'm sure some of them did just that, but those who are still at SNK are giving it their all to produce the best products they can, and most agree that current SNK is in fact doing just that.   It really sucks that supporting those people at SNK who are truly trying their hardest also means technically that some of that money will eventually make its way to someone who shouldn't get any of that support. Unfortunately, if you really trace things down that much, it's more than likely that the wide majority of money that people spend on almost anything goes to terrible, horrible people, because so much of today's various industries are in the hands of those very people.

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.  But at any rate it seems to have been a great boon for SNK these past few years.

People aren't just upset about this because they think the games will be censored (although yes, that would suck), it's due to now being majority owned by a prince who blatantly had a journalist murdered. It doesn't really have anything to do with what is in SNK games right now. This isn't overlooking how it sucks that Tencent is buying up so much everywhere, it's just recognizing how much this instance sucks in a very particular way.

I don't know where you got this idea. PS4 is actually the best version of the game currently. PS5 has too much input lag, XBox is a graveyard, and PC is rife with issues with much of it being related to matchmaking.

Yeah, when there was the initial announcement of the Saudi prince a couple of years ago, I initially had the same ""No! SNK might as well be dead!"" reaction. But then, over time, I remembered that thinking of it that way would be a disservice to the actual employees at SNK, who had absolutely no control over any of this. Sure, some of them could just leave SNK & go elsewhere, and I'm sure some of them did just that, but those who are still at SNK are giving it their all to produce the best products they can, and most agree that current SNK is in fact doing just that.   It really sucks that supporting those people at SNK who are truly trying their hardest also means technically that some of that money will eventually make its way to someone who shouldn't get any of that support. Unfortunately, if you really trace things down that much, it's more than likely that the wide majority of money that people spend on almost anything goes to terrible, horrible people, because so much of today's various industries are in the hands of those very people.

Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was. So on his deathbed, he wished only to be reborn into a peaceful world... and was sent straight to modern-day party-central, Tokyo. The brilliant strategist Kongming will have to adapt to the wild beats and even wilder party people of the modern age.    Ya Boy Kongming! is based on Yuto Yotsuba and Ryō Ogawa's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                For a second, I was tempted to call the premise of this one old hat – yoinking a historic figure from the past and tossing them into the present day has been a go-to premise for comedy movies for ages. But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.       Rebeccca Silverman  Rating:                Would I have been as thrilled with this episode if I hadn't already read the source manga? I'd like to think so, because even without the knowledge of where this is heading, Ya Boy Kongming!'s first episode is a delightful combination of pathos and humor. It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this. Honestly, this was just a really entertaining half-hour, and if it wasn't on your radar, I'd urge you to check it out.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Although the Romance of the Three Kingdoms talk went right over my head, the show clearly lays out the two most important things for us to know about Kongming: 1) he was a master strategist, and 2) his side lost. Therefore, it's possible he sees this gig not only as his second chance at life but also his second chance to win—albeit through philosophy rather than warfare.    One thing I love about this episode is how it addresses the absurdity of its premise. Why is he in Japan in the modern day? Why can he understand Japanese? Why is he young again? Why does he encounter the one person who will not only deal with his apparent eccentricities but even bring him into her home? Why does he meet the one boss who will hire him on the spot? The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.    The other great thing about the episode is that it understands that the most important thing to have in a show about an up-and-coming singer is the music to match. If the songs don't wow you, you can't believe that the supposedly talented singers will make it big, robbing the show of its drama. Honestly, I'm saddened we didn't spend more time listening to Eiko sing (though with runtime limitations I understand why we didn't). I'll be sure to keep an eye out for the soundtrack if nothing else.     discuss this in the forum (213 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.       Rebeccca Silverman  Rating:                Would I have been as thrilled with this episode if I hadn't already read the source manga? I'd like to think so, because even without the knowledge of where this is heading, Ya Boy Kongming!'s first episode is a delightful combination of pathos and humor. It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this. Honestly, this was just a really entertaining half-hour, and if it wasn't on your radar, I'd urge you to check it out.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Although the Romance of the Three Kingdoms talk went right over my head, the show clearly lays out the two most important things for us to know about Kongming: 1) he was a master strategist, and 2) his side lost. Therefore, it's possible he sees this gig not only as his second chance at life but also his second chance to win—albeit through philosophy rather than warfare.    One thing I love about this episode is how it addresses the absurdity of its premise. Why is he in Japan in the modern day? Why can he understand Japanese? Why is he young again? Why does he encounter the one person who will not only deal with his apparent eccentricities but even bring him into her home? Why does he meet the one boss who will hire him on the spot? The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.    The other great thing about the episode is that it understands that the most important thing to have in a show about an up-and-coming singer is the music to match. If the songs don't wow you, you can't believe that the supposedly talented singers will make it big, robbing the show of its drama. Honestly, I'm saddened we didn't spend more time listening to Eiko sing (though with runtime limitations I understand why we didn't). I'll be sure to keep an eye out for the soundtrack if nothing else.     discuss this in the forum (213 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was. So on his deathbed, he wished only to be reborn into a peaceful world... and was sent straight to modern-day party-central, Tokyo. The brilliant strategist Kongming will have to adapt to the wild beats and even wilder party people of the modern age.    Ya Boy Kongming! is based on Yuto Yotsuba and Ryō Ogawa's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                For a second, I was tempted to call the premise of this one old hat – yoinking a historic figure from the past and tossing them into the present day has been a go-to premise for comedy movies for ages. But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.

Therefore, it's possible he sees this gig not only as his second chance at life but also his second chance to win—albeit through philosophy rather than warfare.    One thing I love about this episode is how it addresses the absurdity of its premise. Why is he in Japan in the modern day? Why can he understand Japanese? Why is he young again? Why does he encounter the one person who will not only deal with his apparent eccentricities but even bring him into her home? Why does he meet the one boss who will hire him on the spot? The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.    The other great thing about the episode is that it understands that the most important thing to have in a show about an up-and-coming singer is the music to match. If the songs don't wow you, you can't believe that the supposedly talented singers will make it big, robbing the show of its drama. Honestly, I'm saddened we didn't spend more time listening to Eiko sing (though with runtime limitations I understand why we didn't). I'll be sure to keep an eye out for the soundtrack if nothing else.     discuss this in the forum (213 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was. So on his deathbed, he wished only to be reborn into a peaceful world... and was sent straight to modern-day party-central, Tokyo. The brilliant strategist Kongming will have to adapt to the wild beats and even wilder party people of the modern age.    Ya Boy Kongming! is based on Yuto Yotsuba and Ryō Ogawa's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                For a second, I was tempted to call the premise of this one old hat – yoinking a historic figure from the past and tossing them into the present day has been a go-to premise for comedy movies for ages. But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.       Rebeccca Silverman  Rating:                Would I have been as thrilled with this episode if I hadn't already read the source manga? I'd like to think so, because even without the knowledge of where this is heading, Ya Boy Kongming!'s first episode is a delightful combination of pathos and humor. It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this. Honestly, this was just a really entertaining half-hour, and if it wasn't on your radar, I'd urge you to check it out.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Although the Romance of the Three Kingdoms talk went right over my head, the show clearly lays out the two most important things for us to know about Kongming: 1) he was a master strategist, and 2) his side lost. Therefore, it's possible he sees this gig not only as his second chance at life but also his second chance to win—albeit through philosophy rather than warfare.    One thing I love about this episode is how it addresses the absurdity of its premise. Why is he in Japan in the modern day? Why can he understand Japanese? Why is he young again? Why does he encounter the one person who will not only deal with his apparent eccentricities but even bring him into her home? Why does he meet the one boss who will hire him on the spot? The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.

The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.    The other great thing about the episode is that it understands that the most important thing to have in a show about an up-and-coming singer is the music to match. If the songs don't wow you, you can't believe that the supposedly talented singers will make it big, robbing the show of its drama. Honestly, I'm saddened we didn't spend more time listening to Eiko sing (though with runtime limitations I understand why we didn't). I'll be sure to keep an eye out for the soundtrack if nothing else.     discuss this in the forum (213 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was. So on his deathbed, he wished only to be reborn into a peaceful world... and was sent straight to modern-day party-central, Tokyo. The brilliant strategist Kongming will have to adapt to the wild beats and even wilder party people of the modern age.    Ya Boy Kongming! is based on Yuto Yotsuba and Ryō Ogawa's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                For a second, I was tempted to call the premise of this one old hat – yoinking a historic figure from the past and tossing them into the present day has been a go-to premise for comedy movies for ages. But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.       Rebeccca Silverman  Rating:                Would I have been as thrilled with this episode if I hadn't already read the source manga? I'd like to think so, because even without the knowledge of where this is heading, Ya Boy Kongming!'s first episode is a delightful combination of pathos and humor. It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this. Honestly, this was just a really entertaining half-hour, and if it wasn't on your radar, I'd urge you to check it out.      How was the first episode?

It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this. Honestly, this was just a really entertaining half-hour, and if it wasn't on your radar, I'd urge you to check it out.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Although the Romance of the Three Kingdoms talk went right over my head, the show clearly lays out the two most important things for us to know about Kongming: 1) he was a master strategist, and 2) his side lost. Therefore, it's possible he sees this gig not only as his second chance at life but also his second chance to win—albeit through philosophy rather than warfare.    One thing I love about this episode is how it addresses the absurdity of its premise. Why is he in Japan in the modern day? Why can he understand Japanese? Why is he young again? Why does he encounter the one person who will not only deal with his apparent eccentricities but even bring him into her home? Why does he meet the one boss who will hire him on the spot? The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.    The other great thing about the episode is that it understands that the most important thing to have in a show about an up-and-coming singer is the music to match. If the songs don't wow you, you can't believe that the supposedly talented singers will make it big, robbing the show of its drama. Honestly, I'm saddened we didn't spend more time listening to Eiko sing (though with runtime limitations I understand why we didn't). I'll be sure to keep an eye out for the soundtrack if nothing else.     discuss this in the forum (213 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 4.2              What is this?   General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was. So on his deathbed, he wished only to be reborn into a peaceful world... and was sent straight to modern-day party-central, Tokyo. The brilliant strategist Kongming will have to adapt to the wild beats and even wilder party people of the modern age.    Ya Boy Kongming! is based on Yuto Yotsuba and Ryō Ogawa's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                For a second, I was tempted to call the premise of this one old hat – yoinking a historic figure from the past and tossing them into the present day has been a go-to premise for comedy movies for ages. But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.

Review:         Synopsis:          When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes. Throw it in when the world feels a little too much and let A-ko's physical hijinks clear up your bad day.

Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes.

Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp.

Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.

Review:         Synopsis:          When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes. Throw it in when the world feels a little too much and let A-ko's physical hijinks clear up your bad day.

Review:         Synopsis:          When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes. Throw it in when the world feels a little too much and let A-ko's physical hijinks clear up your bad day.

I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp.

Review:         Synopsis:          When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year.

News Ultraman Anime Season 2 Streams Opening Animation Sequence   posted on 2022-04-07 18:48 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Sequel premieres next Thursday with opening song by NOILION    Netflix and Tsuburaya Productions posted the opening animation sequence (without superimposed credits) for the second anime season based on Eiichi Shimizu and Tomohiro Shimoguchi's Ultraman manga on Thursday. The creator unit NOILION performs the anime's opening theme song ""3.""      The anime will debut on Netflix worldwide on April 14. The new season's first episode will get an advanced screening at the ""Ultraman World Premiere and Orchestra Concert"" event on April 10.    Maaya Sakamoto plays Izumi, a journalist and Kotaro Higashi's love interest. Additionally, Junichi Suwabe voices Alien Pedanto in the anime. Ayane Sakura voices the character Maya, a Wadoran alien.    Netflix describes the anime's story:  Several years have passed since the events of Ultraman, with the legendary ""Giant of Light"" (光の巨人 Hikari no Kyojin) now a memory, as it is believed he returned home after fighting the many giant aliens that invaded the Earth. Shin Hayata's son Shinjiro seems to possess a strange ability, and it is this ability, along with his father's revelation that he was Ultraman, that leads Shinjiro to battle the new aliens invading the Earth as the new Ultraman.  The first anime season premiered globally on Netflix in April 2019 and has 13 episodes. The series then premiered on television in Japan in April 2020. Kenji Kamiyama (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Eden of the East, Napping Princess) and Shinji Aramaki (Appleseed, Harlock: Space Pirate, Starship Troopers: Traitor of Mars) directed the first anime season. Production I.G (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Eden of the East, Napping Princess) and Sola Digital Arts (Appleseed Alpha, Starship Troopers: Invasion, Starship Troopers: Traitor of Mars) produced the anime in 3D CG. Nobuko Toda and Kazuma Jinnouchi composed the music.    Kamiyama, Aramaki, Production I.G, and Sola Digital Arts are returning from the first season for the second one.    Tatsuhisa Suzuki was slated to play the new Ultraman character Kōtarō Higashi/Ultraman Taro  in the second season, but he offered to step down from the role, due to his recent hiatus from ""all entertainment industry activities"" last year. Tomoaki Maeno will voice the character instead. Suzuki performed the opening theme songs for the first season as a member of OLDCODEX.

News Ultraman Anime Season 2 Streams Opening Animation Sequence   posted on 2022-04-07 18:48 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Sequel premieres next Thursday with opening song by NOILION    Netflix and Tsuburaya Productions posted the opening animation sequence (without superimposed credits) for the second anime season based on Eiichi Shimizu and Tomohiro Shimoguchi's Ultraman manga on Thursday. The creator unit NOILION performs the anime's opening theme song ""3.""      The anime will debut on Netflix worldwide on April 14. The new season's first episode will get an advanced screening at the ""Ultraman World Premiere and Orchestra Concert"" event on April 10.    Maaya Sakamoto plays Izumi, a journalist and Kotaro Higashi's love interest. Additionally, Junichi Suwabe voices Alien Pedanto in the anime. Ayane Sakura voices the character Maya, a Wadoran alien.    Netflix describes the anime's story:  Several years have passed since the events of Ultraman, with the legendary ""Giant of Light"" (光の巨人 Hikari no Kyojin) now a memory, as it is believed he returned home after fighting the many giant aliens that invaded the Earth. Shin Hayata's son Shinjiro seems to possess a strange ability, and it is this ability, along with his father's revelation that he was Ultraman, that leads Shinjiro to battle the new aliens invading the Earth as the new Ultraman.  The first anime season premiered globally on Netflix in April 2019 and has 13 episodes. The series then premiered on television in Japan in April 2020. Kenji Kamiyama (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Eden of the East, Napping Princess) and Shinji Aramaki (Appleseed, Harlock: Space Pirate, Starship Troopers: Traitor of Mars) directed the first anime season. Production I.G (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Eden of the East, Napping Princess) and Sola Digital Arts (Appleseed Alpha, Starship Troopers: Invasion, Starship Troopers: Traitor of Mars) produced the anime in 3D CG. Nobuko Toda and Kazuma Jinnouchi composed the music.    Kamiyama, Aramaki, Production I.G, and Sola Digital Arts are returning from the first season for the second one.    Tatsuhisa Suzuki was slated to play the new Ultraman character Kōtarō Higashi/Ultraman Taro  in the second season, but he offered to step down from the role, due to his recent hiatus from ""all entertainment industry activities"" last year. Tomoaki Maeno will voice the character instead. Suzuki performed the opening theme songs for the first season as a member of OLDCODEX.

Then there's Kengan Ashura. There's a reason this series has gained such a dedicated following for its brutal and kinetic fights — the manga it faithfully adapts was written by Yabako Sandrovich, a real-deal martial artist. Like the late, great Sonny Chiba performing karate in a 70s Toei action movie, Sandrovich and his illustrator Daromeon meticulously constructed Kengan Ashura's fights in the original manga, drawing from experience and study in the field of martial arts from around the globe.     Martial arts have been a major element of plenty of anime over the years, and have left a lasting imprint on the medium. Fist of the North Star famously drew from Chinese kung-fu to create one of the foundational series of 80s anime, filled with over-the-top violence and musclebound experts in martial technique. Those same descriptors can easily be applied to Kengan Ashura, the smash hit manga written by Sandrovich and drawn by Daromeon, later adapted into a popular Netflix-distributed anime series by director Seiji Kishi and Larx Entertainment that stays remarkably close to the original material.     Yabako Sandrovich is an interesting guy. One of his former stints before writing manga, which also includes the slice-of-life sensation How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?, was as a ruins excavator. More relevant to Kengan Ashura, he also has at least fourteen years of martial arts experience.    In the world of Kengan, international companies conduct business by employing fighters to enter a secret tournament of the world's deadliest fighting styles. Not only is the selection of martial arts from around the globe on display a veritable buffet for fight technique connoisseurs, it comes from a background of understanding what makes them work. Let's dive into some of the series' main combatants and take a look at the way they fight.     The basis for the mixed martial art fighting style practiced by the main protagonist Tokita Ohma is a combination of two of the most popular and widespread Japanese martial arts — karate and jiu-jitsu. Developed by the Ryukyu kingdom in Okinawa, karate is known for its sudden, explosive strikes that release pent-up force in the form of powerful punches and kicks. Jiu-jitsu originates from the Honshu mainland, and focuses more on using the opponent's momentum against them, redirecting their attacks and movements. The exact style Ohma uses that fuses these practices is the fictional “Niko Style” of Sandrovich's own invention, named after the famous town in Tochigi prefecture. The Niko Style applies secret techniques to the standard karate-based punching and axe-kicking that Ohma regularly performs to unleash a variety of superhuman abilities, and in the spirit of jiu-jitsu, to turn the enemy's own attacks back at them. Not only are the types of moves from these two Japanese martial arts depicted properly, but their core ethos are both intact in this new fantasy-tinged mashup. Like Fist of the North Star before it, Kengan Ashura has taken real martial arts and added a layer of prowess that only a manga character could possess.     Various styles of karate and jiu-jitsu form the basis of several other major characters' chosen disciplines, but let's head south to take a look at a fighter from Thailand, the home of another world-famous fighting style — Muay Thai. Kaolan Wongsawat is known as the “Thai God of War” in the world of Kengan. His moves incorporate the straightforward punches of western boxing, but are mainly based on Thailand's native martial art that dates back to before the 16th century. Using a combination of kneeing, jabbing opponents with elbows, and delivering slamming kicks with one's shins, this close-quarters style has become a favorite of MMA fighters and was popularized in world cinema by the blindingly fast athletics of actor Tony Jaa. Kaolan's superhuman prowess with Muay Thai and super-fast “flicker” jabs make him a dangerous man for any of the tournament's entrants to get near.     Staying in Southeast Asia, let's look at the martial art practiced by boisterous character Saw Paing from Myanmar. Lethwei is a brutal type of bare-knuckle boxing originating thousands of years ago in ancient Myanmar's Pyu Empire, used both for sport and warfare, and still practiced to this day. According to Sandrovich's author's notes in the back of a manga issue featuring Saw Paing, he'd heard through martial arts circles that lethwei fighters from Myanmar were especially strong, inspiring him to create the character. Saw Paing's exuberant personality balances out the annihilating techniques he uses, making him a likable fan favorite.    Crossing the Pacific, we arrive in Brazil, a country home to a sizable population of Japanese immigrants. This cultural exchange resulted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the basis for the style used by Kengan character Imai Cosmo. Cosmo's reputation as the ‘king of stranglers’ comes from a grappling-focused aspect of the Brazilian style' The difference from the original Japanese jiu-jitsu is that the Brazilian style focuses more on grappling with your opponent once you've gotten them into your desired position, putting them in a chokehold or lock. It's this method that allows Cosmo, a smaller fighter, to overpower larger adversaries.     Endearing and earnest American street fighter Adam “The Emperor” Dudley uses a type of blunt attack-oriented mixed martial arts, relying more on sheer force than a specific discipline. Hilariously, he fights on behalf of the “Boss Burger” corporation, whose CEO is a literal clown named Ronald. Very American!     Hailing from England, Mokichi Robinson uses Bartitsu, an archaic British martial art. Yes, there was a martial art developed in England in the Victorian era, though it's fallen into obscurity and is now most widely remembered via a misspelled reference to “Baritsu” in one of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels. Its real-life inventor was an Englishman named Edward W. Barton-Wright who visited Meiji-era Japan as it newly opened to the West and became enamored with Japanese martial arts. Barton-Wright modestly named Bartitsu after himself, combining his last name with “jiu-jitsu”. It was a mixed martial art incorporating the aforementioned Japanese style, western boxing, French Savate, and others. Robinson's use of it is a deep cut, showing the type of research that went into his creation.     Returning to Japan, we find one of the series' darkest characters, former police officer Akoya Seishu. Akoya uses taiho-jutsu, literally “the art of arresting,” a restraining-focused martial art taught to Japanese police officers. While the use of taiho-jutsu is intended to be a non-lethal subduing alternative, Akoya's personal extremism lead him to warp it into a deadly execution technique. Police brutality is a loaded subject, and Kengan Ashura barrels headlong into it via one of its most horrific characters. Is there a thinly-veiled subtext? Is it pure exploitation? Whatever the case, Akoya stands as one of the more thought-provoking characters in the series.     On a lighter note, the “fighting style” of professional wrestling as used by charismatic fan favorite Sekibayashi Jun is (sorry to burst everyone's bubble) not real. WWE-style wrestling is described by that organization itself as “sports entertainment,” a scripted form of theater that uses the illusion of fighting to tell a story. In the world of Kengan Ashura, Sekibayashi is able to successfully hold his own against world-class fighters using methods that would not work in reality, which shows Sandrovich's true attitude toward all of this. Fighting technique is important, but what's more important is the entertainment for the audience. Kengan Ashura is a world where you can suspend your disbelief that a pro wrestler is really fighting and really winning against people trained in deadly martial art styles. It's a fantasy that incorporates just enough reality to be dynamic and interesting, but is heightened and purposely ridiculous in a way that watching an MMA match can't give you. Yes, there are unrealistic things in Kengan Ashura, and a martial arts aficionado like Sandrovich knows that. He's put them in there because a character like Sekibayashi is fun—and by extension, so is this wild and entertaining series.     At the time of this writing, a long-awaited third season of the anime has been announced to finish adapting the manga's original run. It's been a few years' hiatus, but martial arts are timeless — and the manga is well worth reading in the mean time. However over-the-top and insane its narrative and aesthetics become, Kengan Ashura was born and thrives on a reverence for the world's fighting styles in any form, a respectful celebration of martial arts and their appeal as much as a fantastic exaggeration of their entertainment value.

Then there's Kengan Ashura. There's a reason this series has gained such a dedicated following for its brutal and kinetic fights — the manga it faithfully adapts was written by Yabako Sandrovich, a real-deal martial artist. Like the late, great Sonny Chiba performing karate in a 70s Toei action movie, Sandrovich and his illustrator Daromeon meticulously constructed Kengan Ashura's fights in the original manga, drawing from experience and study in the field of martial arts from around the globe.     Martial arts have been a major element of plenty of anime over the years, and have left a lasting imprint on the medium. Fist of the North Star famously drew from Chinese kung-fu to create one of the foundational series of 80s anime, filled with over-the-top violence and musclebound experts in martial technique. Those same descriptors can easily be applied to Kengan Ashura, the smash hit manga written by Sandrovich and drawn by Daromeon, later adapted into a popular Netflix-distributed anime series by director Seiji Kishi and Larx Entertainment that stays remarkably close to the original material.     Yabako Sandrovich is an interesting guy. One of his former stints before writing manga, which also includes the slice-of-life sensation How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?, was as a ruins excavator. More relevant to Kengan Ashura, he also has at least fourteen years of martial arts experience.    In the world of Kengan, international companies conduct business by employing fighters to enter a secret tournament of the world's deadliest fighting styles. Not only is the selection of martial arts from around the globe on display a veritable buffet for fight technique connoisseurs, it comes from a background of understanding what makes them work. Let's dive into some of the series' main combatants and take a look at the way they fight.     The basis for the mixed martial art fighting style practiced by the main protagonist Tokita Ohma is a combination of two of the most popular and widespread Japanese martial arts — karate and jiu-jitsu. Developed by the Ryukyu kingdom in Okinawa, karate is known for its sudden, explosive strikes that release pent-up force in the form of powerful punches and kicks. Jiu-jitsu originates from the Honshu mainland, and focuses more on using the opponent's momentum against them, redirecting their attacks and movements. The exact style Ohma uses that fuses these practices is the fictional “Niko Style” of Sandrovich's own invention, named after the famous town in Tochigi prefecture. The Niko Style applies secret techniques to the standard karate-based punching and axe-kicking that Ohma regularly performs to unleash a variety of superhuman abilities, and in the spirit of jiu-jitsu, to turn the enemy's own attacks back at them. Not only are the types of moves from these two Japanese martial arts depicted properly, but their core ethos are both intact in this new fantasy-tinged mashup. Like Fist of the North Star before it, Kengan Ashura has taken real martial arts and added a layer of prowess that only a manga character could possess.     Various styles of karate and jiu-jitsu form the basis of several other major characters' chosen disciplines, but let's head south to take a look at a fighter from Thailand, the home of another world-famous fighting style — Muay Thai. Kaolan Wongsawat is known as the “Thai God of War” in the world of Kengan. His moves incorporate the straightforward punches of western boxing, but are mainly based on Thailand's native martial art that dates back to before the 16th century. Using a combination of kneeing, jabbing opponents with elbows, and delivering slamming kicks with one's shins, this close-quarters style has become a favorite of MMA fighters and was popularized in world cinema by the blindingly fast athletics of actor Tony Jaa. Kaolan's superhuman prowess with Muay Thai and super-fast “flicker” jabs make him a dangerous man for any of the tournament's entrants to get near.     Staying in Southeast Asia, let's look at the martial art practiced by boisterous character Saw Paing from Myanmar. Lethwei is a brutal type of bare-knuckle boxing originating thousands of years ago in ancient Myanmar's Pyu Empire, used both for sport and warfare, and still practiced to this day. According to Sandrovich's author's notes in the back of a manga issue featuring Saw Paing, he'd heard through martial arts circles that lethwei fighters from Myanmar were especially strong, inspiring him to create the character. Saw Paing's exuberant personality balances out the annihilating techniques he uses, making him a likable fan favorite.    Crossing the Pacific, we arrive in Brazil, a country home to a sizable population of Japanese immigrants. This cultural exchange resulted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the basis for the style used by Kengan character Imai Cosmo. Cosmo's reputation as the ‘king of stranglers’ comes from a grappling-focused aspect of the Brazilian style' The difference from the original Japanese jiu-jitsu is that the Brazilian style focuses more on grappling with your opponent once you've gotten them into your desired position, putting them in a chokehold or lock. It's this method that allows Cosmo, a smaller fighter, to overpower larger adversaries.     Endearing and earnest American street fighter Adam “The Emperor” Dudley uses a type of blunt attack-oriented mixed martial arts, relying more on sheer force than a specific discipline. Hilariously, he fights on behalf of the “Boss Burger” corporation, whose CEO is a literal clown named Ronald. Very American!     Hailing from England, Mokichi Robinson uses Bartitsu, an archaic British martial art. Yes, there was a martial art developed in England in the Victorian era, though it's fallen into obscurity and is now most widely remembered via a misspelled reference to “Baritsu” in one of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels. Its real-life inventor was an Englishman named Edward W. Barton-Wright who visited Meiji-era Japan as it newly opened to the West and became enamored with Japanese martial arts. Barton-Wright modestly named Bartitsu after himself, combining his last name with “jiu-jitsu”. It was a mixed martial art incorporating the aforementioned Japanese style, western boxing, French Savate, and others. Robinson's use of it is a deep cut, showing the type of research that went into his creation.     Returning to Japan, we find one of the series' darkest characters, former police officer Akoya Seishu. Akoya uses taiho-jutsu, literally “the art of arresting,” a restraining-focused martial art taught to Japanese police officers. While the use of taiho-jutsu is intended to be a non-lethal subduing alternative, Akoya's personal extremism lead him to warp it into a deadly execution technique. Police brutality is a loaded subject, and Kengan Ashura barrels headlong into it via one of its most horrific characters. Is there a thinly-veiled subtext? Is it pure exploitation? Whatever the case, Akoya stands as one of the more thought-provoking characters in the series.     On a lighter note, the “fighting style” of professional wrestling as used by charismatic fan favorite Sekibayashi Jun is (sorry to burst everyone's bubble) not real. WWE-style wrestling is described by that organization itself as “sports entertainment,” a scripted form of theater that uses the illusion of fighting to tell a story. In the world of Kengan Ashura, Sekibayashi is able to successfully hold his own against world-class fighters using methods that would not work in reality, which shows Sandrovich's true attitude toward all of this. Fighting technique is important, but what's more important is the entertainment for the audience. Kengan Ashura is a world where you can suspend your disbelief that a pro wrestler is really fighting and really winning against people trained in deadly martial art styles. It's a fantasy that incorporates just enough reality to be dynamic and interesting, but is heightened and purposely ridiculous in a way that watching an MMA match can't give you. Yes, there are unrealistic things in Kengan Ashura, and a martial arts aficionado like Sandrovich knows that. He's put them in there because a character like Sekibayashi is fun—and by extension, so is this wild and entertaining series.     At the time of this writing, a long-awaited third season of the anime has been announced to finish adapting the manga's original run. It's been a few years' hiatus, but martial arts are timeless — and the manga is well worth reading in the mean time. However over-the-top and insane its narrative and aesthetics become, Kengan Ashura was born and thrives on a reverence for the world's fighting styles in any form, a respectful celebration of martial arts and their appeal as much as a fantastic exaggeration of their entertainment value.

Then there's Kengan Ashura. There's a reason this series has gained such a dedicated following for its brutal and kinetic fights — the manga it faithfully adapts was written by Yabako Sandrovich, a real-deal martial artist. Like the late, great Sonny Chiba performing karate in a 70s Toei action movie, Sandrovich and his illustrator Daromeon meticulously constructed Kengan Ashura's fights in the original manga, drawing from experience and study in the field of martial arts from around the globe.     Martial arts have been a major element of plenty of anime over the years, and have left a lasting imprint on the medium. Fist of the North Star famously drew from Chinese kung-fu to create one of the foundational series of 80s anime, filled with over-the-top violence and musclebound experts in martial technique. Those same descriptors can easily be applied to Kengan Ashura, the smash hit manga written by Sandrovich and drawn by Daromeon, later adapted into a popular Netflix-distributed anime series by director Seiji Kishi and Larx Entertainment that stays remarkably close to the original material.     Yabako Sandrovich is an interesting guy. One of his former stints before writing manga, which also includes the slice-of-life sensation How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?, was as a ruins excavator. More relevant to Kengan Ashura, he also has at least fourteen years of martial arts experience.    In the world of Kengan, international companies conduct business by employing fighters to enter a secret tournament of the world's deadliest fighting styles. Not only is the selection of martial arts from around the globe on display a veritable buffet for fight technique connoisseurs, it comes from a background of understanding what makes them work. Let's dive into some of the series' main combatants and take a look at the way they fight.     The basis for the mixed martial art fighting style practiced by the main protagonist Tokita Ohma is a combination of two of the most popular and widespread Japanese martial arts — karate and jiu-jitsu. Developed by the Ryukyu kingdom in Okinawa, karate is known for its sudden, explosive strikes that release pent-up force in the form of powerful punches and kicks. Jiu-jitsu originates from the Honshu mainland, and focuses more on using the opponent's momentum against them, redirecting their attacks and movements. The exact style Ohma uses that fuses these practices is the fictional “Niko Style” of Sandrovich's own invention, named after the famous town in Tochigi prefecture. The Niko Style applies secret techniques to the standard karate-based punching and axe-kicking that Ohma regularly performs to unleash a variety of superhuman abilities, and in the spirit of jiu-jitsu, to turn the enemy's own attacks back at them. Not only are the types of moves from these two Japanese martial arts depicted properly, but their core ethos are both intact in this new fantasy-tinged mashup. Like Fist of the North Star before it, Kengan Ashura has taken real martial arts and added a layer of prowess that only a manga character could possess.     Various styles of karate and jiu-jitsu form the basis of several other major characters' chosen disciplines, but let's head south to take a look at a fighter from Thailand, the home of another world-famous fighting style — Muay Thai. Kaolan Wongsawat is known as the “Thai God of War” in the world of Kengan. His moves incorporate the straightforward punches of western boxing, but are mainly based on Thailand's native martial art that dates back to before the 16th century. Using a combination of kneeing, jabbing opponents with elbows, and delivering slamming kicks with one's shins, this close-quarters style has become a favorite of MMA fighters and was popularized in world cinema by the blindingly fast athletics of actor Tony Jaa. Kaolan's superhuman prowess with Muay Thai and super-fast “flicker” jabs make him a dangerous man for any of the tournament's entrants to get near.     Staying in Southeast Asia, let's look at the martial art practiced by boisterous character Saw Paing from Myanmar. Lethwei is a brutal type of bare-knuckle boxing originating thousands of years ago in ancient Myanmar's Pyu Empire, used both for sport and warfare, and still practiced to this day. According to Sandrovich's author's notes in the back of a manga issue featuring Saw Paing, he'd heard through martial arts circles that lethwei fighters from Myanmar were especially strong, inspiring him to create the character. Saw Paing's exuberant personality balances out the annihilating techniques he uses, making him a likable fan favorite.    Crossing the Pacific, we arrive in Brazil, a country home to a sizable population of Japanese immigrants. This cultural exchange resulted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the basis for the style used by Kengan character Imai Cosmo. Cosmo's reputation as the ‘king of stranglers’ comes from a grappling-focused aspect of the Brazilian style' The difference from the original Japanese jiu-jitsu is that the Brazilian style focuses more on grappling with your opponent once you've gotten them into your desired position, putting them in a chokehold or lock. It's this method that allows Cosmo, a smaller fighter, to overpower larger adversaries.     Endearing and earnest American street fighter Adam “The Emperor” Dudley uses a type of blunt attack-oriented mixed martial arts, relying more on sheer force than a specific discipline. Hilariously, he fights on behalf of the “Boss Burger” corporation, whose CEO is a literal clown named Ronald. Very American!     Hailing from England, Mokichi Robinson uses Bartitsu, an archaic British martial art. Yes, there was a martial art developed in England in the Victorian era, though it's fallen into obscurity and is now most widely remembered via a misspelled reference to “Baritsu” in one of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels. Its real-life inventor was an Englishman named Edward W. Barton-Wright who visited Meiji-era Japan as it newly opened to the West and became enamored with Japanese martial arts. Barton-Wright modestly named Bartitsu after himself, combining his last name with “jiu-jitsu”. It was a mixed martial art incorporating the aforementioned Japanese style, western boxing, French Savate, and others. Robinson's use of it is a deep cut, showing the type of research that went into his creation.     Returning to Japan, we find one of the series' darkest characters, former police officer Akoya Seishu. Akoya uses taiho-jutsu, literally “the art of arresting,” a restraining-focused martial art taught to Japanese police officers. While the use of taiho-jutsu is intended to be a non-lethal subduing alternative, Akoya's personal extremism lead him to warp it into a deadly execution technique. Police brutality is a loaded subject, and Kengan Ashura barrels headlong into it via one of its most horrific characters. Is there a thinly-veiled subtext? Is it pure exploitation? Whatever the case, Akoya stands as one of the more thought-provoking characters in the series.     On a lighter note, the “fighting style” of professional wrestling as used by charismatic fan favorite Sekibayashi Jun is (sorry to burst everyone's bubble) not real. WWE-style wrestling is described by that organization itself as “sports entertainment,” a scripted form of theater that uses the illusion of fighting to tell a story. In the world of Kengan Ashura, Sekibayashi is able to successfully hold his own against world-class fighters using methods that would not work in reality, which shows Sandrovich's true attitude toward all of this. Fighting technique is important, but what's more important is the entertainment for the audience. Kengan Ashura is a world where you can suspend your disbelief that a pro wrestler is really fighting and really winning against people trained in deadly martial art styles. It's a fantasy that incorporates just enough reality to be dynamic and interesting, but is heightened and purposely ridiculous in a way that watching an MMA match can't give you. Yes, there are unrealistic things in Kengan Ashura, and a martial arts aficionado like Sandrovich knows that. He's put them in there because a character like Sekibayashi is fun—and by extension, so is this wild and entertaining series.     At the time of this writing, a long-awaited third season of the anime has been announced to finish adapting the manga's original run. It's been a few years' hiatus, but martial arts are timeless — and the manga is well worth reading in the mean time. However over-the-top and insane its narrative and aesthetics become, Kengan Ashura was born and thrives on a reverence for the world's fighting styles in any form, a respectful celebration of martial arts and their appeal as much as a fantastic exaggeration of their entertainment value.

Then there's Kengan Ashura. There's a reason this series has gained such a dedicated following for its brutal and kinetic fights — the manga it faithfully adapts was written by Yabako Sandrovich, a real-deal martial artist. Like the late, great Sonny Chiba performing karate in a 70s Toei action movie, Sandrovich and his illustrator Daromeon meticulously constructed Kengan Ashura's fights in the original manga, drawing from experience and study in the field of martial arts from around the globe.     Martial arts have been a major element of plenty of anime over the years, and have left a lasting imprint on the medium. Fist of the North Star famously drew from Chinese kung-fu to create one of the foundational series of 80s anime, filled with over-the-top violence and musclebound experts in martial technique. Those same descriptors can easily be applied to Kengan Ashura, the smash hit manga written by Sandrovich and drawn by Daromeon, later adapted into a popular Netflix-distributed anime series by director Seiji Kishi and Larx Entertainment that stays remarkably close to the original material.     Yabako Sandrovich is an interesting guy. One of his former stints before writing manga, which also includes the slice-of-life sensation How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?, was as a ruins excavator. More relevant to Kengan Ashura, he also has at least fourteen years of martial arts experience.    In the world of Kengan, international companies conduct business by employing fighters to enter a secret tournament of the world's deadliest fighting styles. Not only is the selection of martial arts from around the globe on display a veritable buffet for fight technique connoisseurs, it comes from a background of understanding what makes them work. Let's dive into some of the series' main combatants and take a look at the way they fight.     The basis for the mixed martial art fighting style practiced by the main protagonist Tokita Ohma is a combination of two of the most popular and widespread Japanese martial arts — karate and jiu-jitsu. Developed by the Ryukyu kingdom in Okinawa, karate is known for its sudden, explosive strikes that release pent-up force in the form of powerful punches and kicks. Jiu-jitsu originates from the Honshu mainland, and focuses more on using the opponent's momentum against them, redirecting their attacks and movements. The exact style Ohma uses that fuses these practices is the fictional “Niko Style” of Sandrovich's own invention, named after the famous town in Tochigi prefecture. The Niko Style applies secret techniques to the standard karate-based punching and axe-kicking that Ohma regularly performs to unleash a variety of superhuman abilities, and in the spirit of jiu-jitsu, to turn the enemy's own attacks back at them. Not only are the types of moves from these two Japanese martial arts depicted properly, but their core ethos are both intact in this new fantasy-tinged mashup. Like Fist of the North Star before it, Kengan Ashura has taken real martial arts and added a layer of prowess that only a manga character could possess.     Various styles of karate and jiu-jitsu form the basis of several other major characters' chosen disciplines, but let's head south to take a look at a fighter from Thailand, the home of another world-famous fighting style — Muay Thai. Kaolan Wongsawat is known as the “Thai God of War” in the world of Kengan. His moves incorporate the straightforward punches of western boxing, but are mainly based on Thailand's native martial art that dates back to before the 16th century. Using a combination of kneeing, jabbing opponents with elbows, and delivering slamming kicks with one's shins, this close-quarters style has become a favorite of MMA fighters and was popularized in world cinema by the blindingly fast athletics of actor Tony Jaa. Kaolan's superhuman prowess with Muay Thai and super-fast “flicker” jabs make him a dangerous man for any of the tournament's entrants to get near.     Staying in Southeast Asia, let's look at the martial art practiced by boisterous character Saw Paing from Myanmar. Lethwei is a brutal type of bare-knuckle boxing originating thousands of years ago in ancient Myanmar's Pyu Empire, used both for sport and warfare, and still practiced to this day. According to Sandrovich's author's notes in the back of a manga issue featuring Saw Paing, he'd heard through martial arts circles that lethwei fighters from Myanmar were especially strong, inspiring him to create the character. Saw Paing's exuberant personality balances out the annihilating techniques he uses, making him a likable fan favorite.    Crossing the Pacific, we arrive in Brazil, a country home to a sizable population of Japanese immigrants. This cultural exchange resulted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the basis for the style used by Kengan character Imai Cosmo. Cosmo's reputation as the ‘king of stranglers’ comes from a grappling-focused aspect of the Brazilian style' The difference from the original Japanese jiu-jitsu is that the Brazilian style focuses more on grappling with your opponent once you've gotten them into your desired position, putting them in a chokehold or lock. It's this method that allows Cosmo, a smaller fighter, to overpower larger adversaries.     Endearing and earnest American street fighter Adam “The Emperor” Dudley uses a type of blunt attack-oriented mixed martial arts, relying more on sheer force than a specific discipline. Hilariously, he fights on behalf of the “Boss Burger” corporation, whose CEO is a literal clown named Ronald. Very American!     Hailing from England, Mokichi Robinson uses Bartitsu, an archaic British martial art. Yes, there was a martial art developed in England in the Victorian era, though it's fallen into obscurity and is now most widely remembered via a misspelled reference to “Baritsu” in one of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels. Its real-life inventor was an Englishman named Edward W. Barton-Wright who visited Meiji-era Japan as it newly opened to the West and became enamored with Japanese martial arts. Barton-Wright modestly named Bartitsu after himself, combining his last name with “jiu-jitsu”. It was a mixed martial art incorporating the aforementioned Japanese style, western boxing, French Savate, and others. Robinson's use of it is a deep cut, showing the type of research that went into his creation.     Returning to Japan, we find one of the series' darkest characters, former police officer Akoya Seishu. Akoya uses taiho-jutsu, literally “the art of arresting,” a restraining-focused martial art taught to Japanese police officers. While the use of taiho-jutsu is intended to be a non-lethal subduing alternative, Akoya's personal extremism lead him to warp it into a deadly execution technique. Police brutality is a loaded subject, and Kengan Ashura barrels headlong into it via one of its most horrific characters. Is there a thinly-veiled subtext? Is it pure exploitation? Whatever the case, Akoya stands as one of the more thought-provoking characters in the series.     On a lighter note, the “fighting style” of professional wrestling as used by charismatic fan favorite Sekibayashi Jun is (sorry to burst everyone's bubble) not real. WWE-style wrestling is described by that organization itself as “sports entertainment,” a scripted form of theater that uses the illusion of fighting to tell a story. In the world of Kengan Ashura, Sekibayashi is able to successfully hold his own against world-class fighters using methods that would not work in reality, which shows Sandrovich's true attitude toward all of this. Fighting technique is important, but what's more important is the entertainment for the audience. Kengan Ashura is a world where you can suspend your disbelief that a pro wrestler is really fighting and really winning against people trained in deadly martial art styles. It's a fantasy that incorporates just enough reality to be dynamic and interesting, but is heightened and purposely ridiculous in a way that watching an MMA match can't give you. Yes, there are unrealistic things in Kengan Ashura, and a martial arts aficionado like Sandrovich knows that. He's put them in there because a character like Sekibayashi is fun—and by extension, so is this wild and entertaining series.     At the time of this writing, a long-awaited third season of the anime has been announced to finish adapting the manga's original run. It's been a few years' hiatus, but martial arts are timeless — and the manga is well worth reading in the mean time. However over-the-top and insane its narrative and aesthetics become, Kengan Ashura was born and thrives on a reverence for the world's fighting styles in any form, a respectful celebration of martial arts and their appeal as much as a fantastic exaggeration of their entertainment value.

Cosmo's reputation as the ‘king of stranglers’ comes from a grappling-focused aspect of the Brazilian style' The difference from the original Japanese jiu-jitsu is that the Brazilian style focuses more on grappling with your opponent once you've gotten them into your desired position, putting them in a chokehold or lock. It's this method that allows Cosmo, a smaller fighter, to overpower larger adversaries.     Endearing and earnest American street fighter Adam “The Emperor” Dudley uses a type of blunt attack-oriented mixed martial arts, relying more on sheer force than a specific discipline. Hilariously, he fights on behalf of the “Boss Burger” corporation, whose CEO is a literal clown named Ronald. Very American!     Hailing from England, Mokichi Robinson uses Bartitsu, an archaic British martial art. Yes, there was a martial art developed in England in the Victorian era, though it's fallen into obscurity and is now most widely remembered via a misspelled reference to “Baritsu” in one of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels. Its real-life inventor was an Englishman named Edward W. Barton-Wright who visited Meiji-era Japan as it newly opened to the West and became enamored with Japanese martial arts. Barton-Wright modestly named Bartitsu after himself, combining his last name with “jiu-jitsu”. It was a mixed martial art incorporating the aforementioned Japanese style, western boxing, French Savate, and others. Robinson's use of it is a deep cut, showing the type of research that went into his creation.     Returning to Japan, we find one of the series' darkest characters, former police officer Akoya Seishu. Akoya uses taiho-jutsu, literally “the art of arresting,” a restraining-focused martial art taught to Japanese police officers. While the use of taiho-jutsu is intended to be a non-lethal subduing alternative, Akoya's personal extremism lead him to warp it into a deadly execution technique. Police brutality is a loaded subject, and Kengan Ashura barrels headlong into it via one of its most horrific characters. Is there a thinly-veiled subtext? Is it pure exploitation? Whatever the case, Akoya stands as one of the more thought-provoking characters in the series.     On a lighter note, the “fighting style” of professional wrestling as used by charismatic fan favorite Sekibayashi Jun is (sorry to burst everyone's bubble) not real. WWE-style wrestling is described by that organization itself as “sports entertainment,” a scripted form of theater that uses the illusion of fighting to tell a story. In the world of Kengan Ashura, Sekibayashi is able to successfully hold his own against world-class fighters using methods that would not work in reality, which shows Sandrovich's true attitude toward all of this. Fighting technique is important, but what's more important is the entertainment for the audience. Kengan Ashura is a world where you can suspend your disbelief that a pro wrestler is really fighting and really winning against people trained in deadly martial art styles. It's a fantasy that incorporates just enough reality to be dynamic and interesting, but is heightened and purposely ridiculous in a way that watching an MMA match can't give you. Yes, there are unrealistic things in Kengan Ashura, and a martial arts aficionado like Sandrovich knows that. He's put them in there because a character like Sekibayashi is fun—and by extension, so is this wild and entertaining series.     At the time of this writing, a long-awaited third season of the anime has been announced to finish adapting the manga's original run. It's been a few years' hiatus, but martial arts are timeless — and the manga is well worth reading in the mean time. However over-the-top and insane its narrative and aesthetics become, Kengan Ashura was born and thrives on a reverence for the world's fighting styles in any form, a respectful celebration of martial arts and their appeal as much as a fantastic exaggeration of their entertainment value.

Then there's Kengan Ashura. There's a reason this series has gained such a dedicated following for its brutal and kinetic fights — the manga it faithfully adapts was written by Yabako Sandrovich, a real-deal martial artist. Like the late, great Sonny Chiba performing karate in a 70s Toei action movie, Sandrovich and his illustrator Daromeon meticulously constructed Kengan Ashura's fights in the original manga, drawing from experience and study in the field of martial arts from around the globe.     Martial arts have been a major element of plenty of anime over the years, and have left a lasting imprint on the medium. Fist of the North Star famously drew from Chinese kung-fu to create one of the foundational series of 80s anime, filled with over-the-top violence and musclebound experts in martial technique. Those same descriptors can easily be applied to Kengan Ashura, the smash hit manga written by Sandrovich and drawn by Daromeon, later adapted into a popular Netflix-distributed anime series by director Seiji Kishi and Larx Entertainment that stays remarkably close to the original material.     Yabako Sandrovich is an interesting guy. One of his former stints before writing manga, which also includes the slice-of-life sensation How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?, was as a ruins excavator. More relevant to Kengan Ashura, he also has at least fourteen years of martial arts experience.    In the world of Kengan, international companies conduct business by employing fighters to enter a secret tournament of the world's deadliest fighting styles. Not only is the selection of martial arts from around the globe on display a veritable buffet for fight technique connoisseurs, it comes from a background of understanding what makes them work. Let's dive into some of the series' main combatants and take a look at the way they fight.     The basis for the mixed martial art fighting style practiced by the main protagonist Tokita Ohma is a combination of two of the most popular and widespread Japanese martial arts — karate and jiu-jitsu. Developed by the Ryukyu kingdom in Okinawa, karate is known for its sudden, explosive strikes that release pent-up force in the form of powerful punches and kicks. Jiu-jitsu originates from the Honshu mainland, and focuses more on using the opponent's momentum against them, redirecting their attacks and movements. The exact style Ohma uses that fuses these practices is the fictional “Niko Style” of Sandrovich's own invention, named after the famous town in Tochigi prefecture. The Niko Style applies secret techniques to the standard karate-based punching and axe-kicking that Ohma regularly performs to unleash a variety of superhuman abilities, and in the spirit of jiu-jitsu, to turn the enemy's own attacks back at them. Not only are the types of moves from these two Japanese martial arts depicted properly, but their core ethos are both intact in this new fantasy-tinged mashup. Like Fist of the North Star before it, Kengan Ashura has taken real martial arts and added a layer of prowess that only a manga character could possess.     Various styles of karate and jiu-jitsu form the basis of several other major characters' chosen disciplines, but let's head south to take a look at a fighter from Thailand, the home of another world-famous fighting style — Muay Thai. Kaolan Wongsawat is known as the “Thai God of War” in the world of Kengan. His moves incorporate the straightforward punches of western boxing, but are mainly based on Thailand's native martial art that dates back to before the 16th century. Using a combination of kneeing, jabbing opponents with elbows, and delivering slamming kicks with one's shins, this close-quarters style has become a favorite of MMA fighters and was popularized in world cinema by the blindingly fast athletics of actor Tony Jaa. Kaolan's superhuman prowess with Muay Thai and super-fast “flicker” jabs make him a dangerous man for any of the tournament's entrants to get near.     Staying in Southeast Asia, let's look at the martial art practiced by boisterous character Saw Paing from Myanmar. Lethwei is a brutal type of bare-knuckle boxing originating thousands of years ago in ancient Myanmar's Pyu Empire, used both for sport and warfare, and still practiced to this day. According to Sandrovich's author's notes in the back of a manga issue featuring Saw Paing, he'd heard through martial arts circles that lethwei fighters from Myanmar were especially strong, inspiring him to create the character. Saw Paing's exuberant personality balances out the annihilating techniques he uses, making him a likable fan favorite.    Crossing the Pacific, we arrive in Brazil, a country home to a sizable population of Japanese immigrants. This cultural exchange resulted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the basis for the style used by Kengan character Imai Cosmo. Cosmo's reputation as the ‘king of stranglers’ comes from a grappling-focused aspect of the Brazilian style' The difference from the original Japanese jiu-jitsu is that the Brazilian style focuses more on grappling with your opponent once you've gotten them into your desired position, putting them in a chokehold or lock. It's this method that allows Cosmo, a smaller fighter, to overpower larger adversaries.     Endearing and earnest American street fighter Adam “The Emperor” Dudley uses a type of blunt attack-oriented mixed martial arts, relying more on sheer force than a specific discipline. Hilariously, he fights on behalf of the “Boss Burger” corporation, whose CEO is a literal clown named Ronald. Very American!

Fist of the North Star famously drew from Chinese kung-fu to create one of the foundational series of 80s anime, filled with over-the-top violence and musclebound experts in martial technique. Those same descriptors can easily be applied to Kengan Ashura, the smash hit manga written by Sandrovich and drawn by Daromeon, later adapted into a popular Netflix-distributed anime series by director Seiji Kishi and Larx Entertainment that stays remarkably close to the original material.     Yabako Sandrovich is an interesting guy. One of his former stints before writing manga, which also includes the slice-of-life sensation How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?, was as a ruins excavator. More relevant to Kengan Ashura, he also has at least fourteen years of martial arts experience.    In the world of Kengan, international companies conduct business by employing fighters to enter a secret tournament of the world's deadliest fighting styles. Not only is the selection of martial arts from around the globe on display a veritable buffet for fight technique connoisseurs, it comes from a background of understanding what makes them work. Let's dive into some of the series' main combatants and take a look at the way they fight.     The basis for the mixed martial art fighting style practiced by the main protagonist Tokita Ohma is a combination of two of the most popular and widespread Japanese martial arts — karate and jiu-jitsu. Developed by the Ryukyu kingdom in Okinawa, karate is known for its sudden, explosive strikes that release pent-up force in the form of powerful punches and kicks. Jiu-jitsu originates from the Honshu mainland, and focuses more on using the opponent's momentum against them, redirecting their attacks and movements. The exact style Ohma uses that fuses these practices is the fictional “Niko Style” of Sandrovich's own invention, named after the famous town in Tochigi prefecture. The Niko Style applies secret techniques to the standard karate-based punching and axe-kicking that Ohma regularly performs to unleash a variety of superhuman abilities, and in the spirit of jiu-jitsu, to turn the enemy's own attacks back at them. Not only are the types of moves from these two Japanese martial arts depicted properly, but their core ethos are both intact in this new fantasy-tinged mashup. Like Fist of the North Star before it, Kengan Ashura has taken real martial arts and added a layer of prowess that only a manga character could possess.     Various styles of karate and jiu-jitsu form the basis of several other major characters' chosen disciplines, but let's head south to take a look at a fighter from Thailand, the home of another world-famous fighting style — Muay Thai. Kaolan Wongsawat is known as the “Thai God of War” in the world of Kengan. His moves incorporate the straightforward punches of western boxing, but are mainly based on Thailand's native martial art that dates back to before the 16th century. Using a combination of kneeing, jabbing opponents with elbows, and delivering slamming kicks with one's shins, this close-quarters style has become a favorite of MMA fighters and was popularized in world cinema by the blindingly fast athletics of actor Tony Jaa. Kaolan's superhuman prowess with Muay Thai and super-fast “flicker” jabs make him a dangerous man for any of the tournament's entrants to get near.     Staying in Southeast Asia, let's look at the martial art practiced by boisterous character Saw Paing from Myanmar. Lethwei is a brutal type of bare-knuckle boxing originating thousands of years ago in ancient Myanmar's Pyu Empire, used both for sport and warfare, and still practiced to this day. According to Sandrovich's author's notes in the back of a manga issue featuring Saw Paing, he'd heard through martial arts circles that lethwei fighters from Myanmar were especially strong, inspiring him to create the character. Saw Paing's exuberant personality balances out the annihilating techniques he uses, making him a likable fan favorite.    Crossing the Pacific, we arrive in Brazil, a country home to a sizable population of Japanese immigrants. This cultural exchange resulted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the basis for the style used by Kengan character Imai Cosmo. Cosmo's reputation as the ‘king of stranglers’ comes from a grappling-focused aspect of the Brazilian style' The difference from the original Japanese jiu-jitsu is that the Brazilian style focuses more on grappling with your opponent once you've gotten them into your desired position, putting them in a chokehold or lock. It's this method that allows Cosmo, a smaller fighter, to overpower larger adversaries.     Endearing and earnest American street fighter Adam “The Emperor” Dudley uses a type of blunt attack-oriented mixed martial arts, relying more on sheer force than a specific discipline. Hilariously, he fights on behalf of the “Boss Burger” corporation, whose CEO is a literal clown named Ronald. Very American!     Hailing from England, Mokichi Robinson uses Bartitsu, an archaic British martial art. Yes, there was a martial art developed in England in the Victorian era, though it's fallen into obscurity and is now most widely remembered via a misspelled reference to “Baritsu” in one of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels. Its real-life inventor was an Englishman named Edward W. Barton-Wright who visited Meiji-era Japan as it newly opened to the West and became enamored with Japanese martial arts. Barton-Wright modestly named Bartitsu after himself, combining his last name with “jiu-jitsu”. It was a mixed martial art incorporating the aforementioned Japanese style, western boxing, French Savate, and others. Robinson's use of it is a deep cut, showing the type of research that went into his creation.     Returning to Japan, we find one of the series' darkest characters, former police officer Akoya Seishu. Akoya uses taiho-jutsu, literally “the art of arresting,” a restraining-focused martial art taught to Japanese police officers. While the use of taiho-jutsu is intended to be a non-lethal subduing alternative, Akoya's personal extremism lead him to warp it into a deadly execution technique. Police brutality is a loaded subject, and Kengan Ashura barrels headlong into it via one of its most horrific characters. Is there a thinly-veiled subtext? Is it pure exploitation? Whatever the case, Akoya stands as one of the more thought-provoking characters in the series.     On a lighter note, the “fighting style” of professional wrestling as used by charismatic fan favorite Sekibayashi Jun is (sorry to burst everyone's bubble) not real. WWE-style wrestling is described by that organization itself as “sports entertainment,” a scripted form of theater that uses the illusion of fighting to tell a story. In the world of Kengan Ashura, Sekibayashi is able to successfully hold his own against world-class fighters using methods that would not work in reality, which shows Sandrovich's true attitude toward all of this. Fighting technique is important, but what's more important is the entertainment for the audience. Kengan Ashura is a world where you can suspend your disbelief that a pro wrestler is really fighting and really winning against people trained in deadly martial art styles. It's a fantasy that incorporates just enough reality to be dynamic and interesting, but is heightened and purposely ridiculous in a way that watching an MMA match can't give you. Yes, there are unrealistic things in Kengan Ashura, and a martial arts aficionado like Sandrovich knows that. He's put them in there because a character like Sekibayashi is fun—and by extension, so is this wild and entertaining series.     At the time of this writing, a long-awaited third season of the anime has been announced to finish adapting the manga's original run. It's been a few years' hiatus, but martial arts are timeless — and the manga is well worth reading in the mean time. However over-the-top and insane its narrative and aesthetics become, Kengan Ashura was born and thrives on a reverence for the world's fighting styles in any form, a respectful celebration of martial arts and their appeal as much as a fantastic exaggeration of their entertainment value.    Raffael Coronelli is an out-of-practice First Dan Black Belt in Taekwondo, author of How to Have an Adventure in Northern Japan, Daikaiju Yuki, and other books, and has contributed essays to blu-ray releases from Arrow Video.

Then there's Kengan Ashura. There's a reason this series has gained such a dedicated following for its brutal and kinetic fights — the manga it faithfully adapts was written by Yabako Sandrovich, a real-deal martial artist. Like the late, great Sonny Chiba performing karate in a 70s Toei action movie, Sandrovich and his illustrator Daromeon meticulously constructed Kengan Ashura's fights in the original manga, drawing from experience and study in the field of martial arts from around the globe.
