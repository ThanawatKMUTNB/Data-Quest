What a ride this has been, Trough all of the saga there was never a bump in quality in storytelling.  Surely will be missed.   Season four it’s coming this autumn and I can only hope for a Five season to complete the Manga.

I keep assuming the anime will be done, and then a new season happens, so maybe it is doing well enough to keep going.  It's been a long time since something set up shop in my brain the way Golden Kamuy has, so I need to see how this all goes.

What a ride this has been, Trough all of the saga there was never a bump in quality in storytelling.  Surely will be missed.   Season four it’s coming this autumn and I can only hope for a Five season to complete the Manga.

First Berserk, then Chihayafuru, and now Golden Kamuy, suddenly a lot of manga that I adore are coming to an end. And Kaguya-sama seems to be ending soon as well. Damn.

Oh wow! Can they really complete it if they do just 24-25 more episodes? Assuming the pacing and length of the previous seasons are kept?      Back to top                  R.

I keep assuming the anime will be done, and then a new season happens, so maybe it is doing well enough to keep going.  It's been a long time since something set up shop in my brain the way Golden Kamuy has, so I need to see how this all goes.

I keep assuming the anime will be done, and then a new season happens, so maybe it is doing well enough to keep going.

What a ride this has been, Trough all of the saga there was never a bump in quality in storytelling.  Surely will be missed.   Season four it’s coming this autumn and I can only hope for a Five season to complete the Manga.

Oh wow! Can they really complete it if they do just 24-25 more episodes? Assuming the pacing and length of the previous seasons are kept?      Back to top                  R.

Meisaku-kun anime shorts launched a Makuake crowdfunding campaign project for a new season on Friday, and the campaign met its goal on the same day. As of press time, the project has raised 7,561,000 yen (about US$61,000), exceeding its goal of 5 million yen (about US$40,000). The campaign will end on June 20.      The project funds four anime shorts for distribution on YouTube. Stretch goals will include additional episodes, as well as other features like ending theme animation and character songs. The campaign will reveal more information within the next week.    Backer rewards include production report sets, T-shirts, posters autographed voice actors, character puppets, and the opportunity to voice act in the anime.    Taketo Shinkai is returning to direct the anime at Pie in the sky with character design by Jun Oson. The main cast is returning as well.    The anime's sixth season premiered during NHK Educational TV's Beat World variety show in April 2021. Crunchyroll streamed the season as it aired in Japan. The anime's final episode aired on March 25. Kensho Ono, Takuya Eguchi, Masaki Satō, and comedy duos Nasunakanishi and Ushiro City continued to voice roles in the anime.    AnimeLog (Anilog) began streaming the anime on its global YouTube channel in November 2020.    AnimeLog describes the series:  Once upon a time, there was a prestigious school called ""Ryugu Elementary School"" that produced many famous characters. One day, an ordinary boy named ""Matsuda Meisaku"" entered Ryugu Elementary School. Will he be able to graduate from the school as a masterpiece character, surrounded by a lot of strong characters such as 'Sweetie' who is super stupid and high-tension, 'Musubi' who is mad and called 'Onigiri', 'Nokio' who is a narcissist and calls himself a robot, and 'Bolt' who is obviously faster than a rabbit?  The show premiered in April 2016 during Beat World with 39 five-minute episodes.

Meisaku-kun Anime Launches Crowdfunding Project for New Season, Meets Goal on Same Day   posted on 2022-04-09 00:27 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         4 anime shorts will stream on YouTube     The Ahare! Meisaku-kun anime shorts launched a Makuake crowdfunding campaign project for a new season on Friday, and the campaign met its goal on the same day. As of press time, the project has raised 7,561,000 yen (about US$61,000), exceeding its goal of 5 million yen (about US$40,000). The campaign will end on June 20.      The project funds four anime shorts for distribution on YouTube. Stretch goals will include additional episodes, as well as other features like ending theme animation and character songs. The campaign will reveal more information within the next week.    Backer rewards include production report sets, T-shirts, posters autographed voice actors, character puppets, and the opportunity to voice act in the anime.    Taketo Shinkai is returning to direct the anime at Pie in the sky with character design by Jun Oson. The main cast is returning as well.    The anime's sixth season premiered during NHK Educational TV's Beat World variety show in April 2021. Crunchyroll streamed the season as it aired in Japan. The anime's final episode aired on March 25. Kensho Ono, Takuya Eguchi, Masaki Satō, and comedy duos Nasunakanishi and Ushiro City continued to voice roles in the anime.    AnimeLog (Anilog) began streaming the anime on its global YouTube channel in November 2020.    AnimeLog describes the series:  Once upon a time, there was a prestigious school called ""Ryugu Elementary School"" that produced many famous characters. One day, an ordinary boy named ""Matsuda Meisaku"" entered Ryugu Elementary School. Will he be able to graduate from the school as a masterpiece character, surrounded by a lot of strong characters such as 'Sweetie' who is super stupid and high-tension, 'Musubi' who is mad and called 'Onigiri', 'Nokio' who is a narcissist and calls himself a robot, and 'Bolt' who is obviously faster than a rabbit?  The show premiered in April 2016 during Beat World with 39 five-minute episodes.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   It is the year 2062, two decades after the failure of a massive workforce automation project. However, Artemis, the artificial intelligence at the core of that project, had decided to attack humanity, and the resulting war laid waste to Earth. A lone girl, Empress, wakes up in an underground laboratory at a base. She is one of three surviving guardians of humanity. However, she has no memories of what came before. All she knows is what a colonel of the peace-building force tells her. Artemis is constructing a space elevator to link the Moon and Earth, and Empress is ordered to destroy the space elevator before its completion. If the elevator is completed, the hordes of giant mechanized forces being mass-produced on the Moon will descend upon Earth.    Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall is the latest entry in the Black Rock Shooter franchise and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Sundays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Black Rock Shooter is one of those intellectual properties that I know the name of but little else. Luckily, since Dawn Fall is a reboot set in a completely new universe, that doesn't seem to matter. The setting is one we've all seen before: There's been a robot apocalypse of sorts and now humanity is on its last legs. However, there are a few AI who continue to fight for the human race—including our titular heroine, Black Rock Shooter.    This anime starts with the classic go-to for creating an audience POV character: amnesia. Not only does it allow Black Rock Shooter to ask all the dumb questions that any person living in the fictional world would already know the answers to, it also allows her to be super powerful without any explanation. Of course, the big drawback here is that, without memories, Black Rock Shooter has very little in the way of personality. All she knows is that she has to reach “lighthouse no. 8” and that she's not willing to abandon those in her care regardless of the tactical situation. It's a solid enough starting point, but for the moment she's not much of a character.    Unfortunately, neither are the other three main characters of this episode. We have the stereotypical protective big brother/sick little sister duo and a hardass military commander. Honestly, there's nothing more to them than that—which leaves the action to carry the show.    More than anything else, this first episode is a series of fight scenes. All of them are decently choreographed and show off the above average CG animation used in the show, further bolstered by a surprisingly rocking soundtrack. However, the black, brown, and grey color pallet can make it hard to see what is happening at times—especially during the fights that occur at night.    All in all, I'm not sure what to think of Dawn Fall. So far, it's little more than a pile of clichés—in both setting and characters. Maybe it will turn into something special down the line but this premiere is largely unimpressive.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   It is the year 2062, two decades after the failure of a massive workforce automation project. However, Artemis, the artificial intelligence at the core of that project, had decided to attack humanity, and the resulting war laid waste to Earth. A lone girl, Empress, wakes up in an underground laboratory at a base. She is one of three surviving guardians of humanity. However, she has no memories of what came before. All she knows is what a colonel of the peace-building force tells her. Artemis is constructing a space elevator to link the Moon and Earth, and Empress is ordered to destroy the space elevator before its completion. If the elevator is completed, the hordes of giant mechanized forces being mass-produced on the Moon will descend upon Earth.    Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall is the latest entry in the Black Rock Shooter franchise and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Sundays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Black Rock Shooter is one of those intellectual properties that I know the name of but little else. Luckily, since Dawn Fall is a reboot set in a completely new universe, that doesn't seem to matter. The setting is one we've all seen before: There's been a robot apocalypse of sorts and now humanity is on its last legs. However, there are a few AI who continue to fight for the human race—including our titular heroine, Black Rock Shooter.    This anime starts with the classic go-to for creating an audience POV character: amnesia. Not only does it allow Black Rock Shooter to ask all the dumb questions that any person living in the fictional world would already know the answers to, it also allows her to be super powerful without any explanation. Of course, the big drawback here is that, without memories, Black Rock Shooter has very little in the way of personality. All she knows is that she has to reach “lighthouse no. 8” and that she's not willing to abandon those in her care regardless of the tactical situation. It's a solid enough starting point, but for the moment she's not much of a character.    Unfortunately, neither are the other three main characters of this episode. We have the stereotypical protective big brother/sick little sister duo and a hardass military commander. Honestly, there's nothing more to them than that—which leaves the action to carry the show.    More than anything else, this first episode is a series of fight scenes. All of them are decently choreographed and show off the above average CG animation used in the show, further bolstered by a surprisingly rocking soundtrack. However, the black, brown, and grey color pallet can make it hard to see what is happening at times—especially during the fights that occur at night.    All in all, I'm not sure what to think of Dawn Fall. So far, it's little more than a pile of clichés—in both setting and characters. Maybe it will turn into something special down the line but this premiere is largely unimpressive.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   It is the year 2062, two decades after the failure of a massive workforce automation project. However, Artemis, the artificial intelligence at the core of that project, had decided to attack humanity, and the resulting war laid waste to Earth. A lone girl, Empress, wakes up in an underground laboratory at a base. She is one of three surviving guardians of humanity. However, she has no memories of what came before. All she knows is what a colonel of the peace-building force tells her. Artemis is constructing a space elevator to link the Moon and Earth, and Empress is ordered to destroy the space elevator before its completion. If the elevator is completed, the hordes of giant mechanized forces being mass-produced on the Moon will descend upon Earth.    Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall is the latest entry in the Black Rock Shooter franchise and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Sundays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Black Rock Shooter is one of those intellectual properties that I know the name of but little else. Luckily, since Dawn Fall is a reboot set in a completely new universe, that doesn't seem to matter. The setting is one we've all seen before: There's been a robot apocalypse of sorts and now humanity is on its last legs. However, there are a few AI who continue to fight for the human race—including our titular heroine, Black Rock Shooter.    This anime starts with the classic go-to for creating an audience POV character: amnesia. Not only does it allow Black Rock Shooter to ask all the dumb questions that any person living in the fictional world would already know the answers to, it also allows her to be super powerful without any explanation. Of course, the big drawback here is that, without memories, Black Rock Shooter has very little in the way of personality. All she knows is that she has to reach “lighthouse no. 8” and that she's not willing to abandon those in her care regardless of the tactical situation. It's a solid enough starting point, but for the moment she's not much of a character.    Unfortunately, neither are the other three main characters of this episode. We have the stereotypical protective big brother/sick little sister duo and a hardass military commander. Honestly, there's nothing more to them than that—which leaves the action to carry the show.    More than anything else, this first episode is a series of fight scenes. All of them are decently choreographed and show off the above average CG animation used in the show, further bolstered by a surprisingly rocking soundtrack. However, the black, brown, and grey color pallet can make it hard to see what is happening at times—especially during the fights that occur at night.    All in all, I'm not sure what to think of Dawn Fall. So far, it's little more than a pile of clichés—in both setting and characters. Maybe it will turn into something special down the line but this premiere is largely unimpressive.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

However, there are a few AI who continue to fight for the human race—including our titular heroine, Black Rock Shooter.    This anime starts with the classic go-to for creating an audience POV character: amnesia. Not only does it allow Black Rock Shooter to ask all the dumb questions that any person living in the fictional world would already know the answers to, it also allows her to be super powerful without any explanation. Of course, the big drawback here is that, without memories, Black Rock Shooter has very little in the way of personality. All she knows is that she has to reach “lighthouse no. 8” and that she's not willing to abandon those in her care regardless of the tactical situation. It's a solid enough starting point, but for the moment she's not much of a character.    Unfortunately, neither are the other three main characters of this episode. We have the stereotypical protective big brother/sick little sister duo and a hardass military commander. Honestly, there's nothing more to them than that—which leaves the action to carry the show.    More than anything else, this first episode is a series of fight scenes. All of them are decently choreographed and show off the above average CG animation used in the show, further bolstered by a surprisingly rocking soundtrack. However, the black, brown, and grey color pallet can make it hard to see what is happening at times—especially during the fights that occur at night.    All in all, I'm not sure what to think of Dawn Fall. So far, it's little more than a pile of clichés—in both setting and characters. Maybe it will turn into something special down the line but this premiere is largely unimpressive.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,{}

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Theme Song Band Mili   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022          International indie rockers Mili made their anisong debut in the 2016 series Bloodivores and have since gone on to contribute themes for  Goblin Slayer, Gleipnir, amd Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045. The group's newest song ""Paper Bouquet"" will be featured as the opening theme in the upcoming anime series The Executioner and Her Way of Life and is available digitally today.    Anime News Network had the opportunity to interview the group's lead vocalist Cassie Wei about the band's unique sound, her anime and manga recommendations, and the upcoming series.    The group 'Mili' formed in 2012, can you tell us how you each met and about the formation of the group?   Cassie Wei: Around a year or two before Mili was formed, I was making covers of Kasai's Vocaloid songs and posting them on YouTube. At the time, I was in high school, and Kasai was using a different name. When he saw my videos, he got in contact with me through Twitter. He invited me to join his new unit afterwards. It sounded fun so I immediately said yes (laughs). It genuinely has been a lot of fun.    After that, Kasai invited some of his former bandmates: bassist Yukihito and drummer Shoto. Together, we formed Mili, and when we were producing our first album, we had the opportunity to bring the illustrator Ao on board.    Can you talk about your group name, ""Mili"" and the inspiration from the Grimm fairytale? How does the group name represent your music?   Cassie: The Grimm fairytale ""Dear Mili"" is honestly quite an offbeat story, in my opinion (laughs). The message isn't clear, nor does it tell you what the protagonist Mili was feeling, or whether the ending was happy or bad. Yet it's a mysterious tale through which you can feel a sense of beauty. I think that this beautiful yet eerily bizarre aspect is a good match for our style of music.    Vocalist Cassie Wei is multi-talented; on top of singing she also has a degree in software engineering. Does she still have goals of creating computer games in the future?   Cassie: Lately, I've been wanting to express my values in a more easy-to-digest format. I love games, of course, and I think it's an excellent medium for deep-diving into a world, but it takes such a long time before you can show your work to other people, so I realized it was unsuited for me. There are so many ideas in my head that I want to express and so many messages I want to convey that it all threatens to get buried. Every day I think of some new kind of story. If I spend too much time on each individual thing, then (as far as I am concerned) I would turn into someone who can't give shape to their ideas. I think that's why I made the switch to writing songs.    How would you describe the mood of your song ""Paper Bouquet?""   Cassie: Fortitude, intensity, and a bit of poignancy, I suppose?    Were there any notes or directions provided by the anime staff for creating the song?   Cassie: We received some advice for the composition from the production side, but they generally left things up to Mili. I have so much gratitude for the production staff who believed in our sound.    Are any of the members anime, manga, or light novel fans? What are some of your favorites?   Cassie: All the members are otaku of some kind (laughs). Although everyone's into different genres. When I was in elementary school, I watched so much anime every day, and I'd even read manga in the bathtub. These days, I'm a fan of Shūzō Oshimi's Blood on the Tracks. I think it's great how it expresses the story and the feelings of the characters not through words but through images.     Are there any anime theme songs that you consider 'iconic' or that you listen to often?   Cassie: I'm quite the anime otaku, so there are way too many songs for comfort (laughs). When I was a kid, Yuki Kajiura's “Akatsuki no Kuruma” (from Mobile Suit Gundam Seed) was a masterpiece to me. Also, when I was in elementary school, I watched Destiny of the Shrine Maiden (not an anime an elementary schoolchild should watch, by the way). I was a huge fan of the ED song “Agony” performed by KOTOKO.    What bands or musicians do you consider major influences?   Cassie: There isn't a specific artist, but I've been influenced a lot by anisongs and J-Pop as a genre. Although I'm Canadian, I've loved anime and games since I was a kid, so I generally listened to anisongs. Anisongs are distinctive for their strong melodies. You don't find songs with such a feeling of presence in the west. It was very novel to me as a child. I suppose that's why Mili songs always have a strong melody line? My flashy melodies complement Kasai's classic and rock band experience. I think that's the source of Mili's unique sound today.    Can you recommend “The Executioner and Her Way of Life” to the western audience？   Cassie: I've seen the completed footage with my own eyes. So I can say this: The animation is sooooo pretty! It's a very impressive show, well worth watching, with solid action scenes. The musical score is a perfect match for each scene, which raises the excitement.    It's an easy anime to get into while also having a very intricate plot and setting. There's a lot of depth to the story. I can absolutely recommend it to people who love fantasy. Even people who don't have much interest in orthodox fantasy or the isekai genre ought to take the opportunity to watch it. It might become a new love for you.    Make sure to watch The Executioner and Her Way of Life!    The Executioner and Her Way of Life will stream on HIDIVE   Readers can find Mili on YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music.     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Theme Song Band Mili   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022          International indie rockers Mili made their anisong debut in the 2016 series Bloodivores and have since gone on to contribute themes for  Goblin Slayer, Gleipnir, amd Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045. The group's newest song ""Paper Bouquet"" will be featured as the opening theme in the upcoming anime series The Executioner and Her Way of Life and is available digitally today.    Anime News Network had the opportunity to interview the group's lead vocalist Cassie Wei about the band's unique sound, her anime and manga recommendations, and the upcoming series.    The group 'Mili' formed in 2012, can you tell us how you each met and about the formation of the group?   Cassie Wei: Around a year or two before Mili was formed, I was making covers of Kasai's Vocaloid songs and posting them on YouTube. At the time, I was in high school, and Kasai was using a different name. When he saw my videos, he got in contact with me through Twitter. He invited me to join his new unit afterwards. It sounded fun so I immediately said yes (laughs). It genuinely has been a lot of fun.    After that, Kasai invited some of his former bandmates: bassist Yukihito and drummer Shoto. Together, we formed Mili, and when we were producing our first album, we had the opportunity to bring the illustrator Ao on board.    Can you talk about your group name, ""Mili"" and the inspiration from the Grimm fairytale? How does the group name represent your music?   Cassie: The Grimm fairytale ""Dear Mili"" is honestly quite an offbeat story, in my opinion (laughs). The message isn't clear, nor does it tell you what the protagonist Mili was feeling, or whether the ending was happy or bad. Yet it's a mysterious tale through which you can feel a sense of beauty. I think that this beautiful yet eerily bizarre aspect is a good match for our style of music.    Vocalist Cassie Wei is multi-talented; on top of singing she also has a degree in software engineering. Does she still have goals of creating computer games in the future?   Cassie: Lately, I've been wanting to express my values in a more easy-to-digest format. I love games, of course, and I think it's an excellent medium for deep-diving into a world, but it takes such a long time before you can show your work to other people, so I realized it was unsuited for me. There are so many ideas in my head that I want to express and so many messages I want to convey that it all threatens to get buried. Every day I think of some new kind of story. If I spend too much time on each individual thing, then (as far as I am concerned) I would turn into someone who can't give shape to their ideas. I think that's why I made the switch to writing songs.    How would you describe the mood of your song ""Paper Bouquet?""   Cassie: Fortitude, intensity, and a bit of poignancy, I suppose?    Were there any notes or directions provided by the anime staff for creating the song?   Cassie: We received some advice for the composition from the production side, but they generally left things up to Mili. I have so much gratitude for the production staff who believed in our sound.    Are any of the members anime, manga, or light novel fans? What are some of your favorites?   Cassie: All the members are otaku of some kind (laughs). Although everyone's into different genres. When I was in elementary school, I watched so much anime every day, and I'd even read manga in the bathtub. These days, I'm a fan of Shūzō Oshimi's Blood on the Tracks. I think it's great how it expresses the story and the feelings of the characters not through words but through images.     Are there any anime theme songs that you consider 'iconic' or that you listen to often?   Cassie: I'm quite the anime otaku, so there are way too many songs for comfort (laughs). When I was a kid, Yuki Kajiura's “Akatsuki no Kuruma” (from Mobile Suit Gundam Seed) was a masterpiece to me. Also, when I was in elementary school, I watched Destiny of the Shrine Maiden (not an anime an elementary schoolchild should watch, by the way). I was a huge fan of the ED song “Agony” performed by KOTOKO.    What bands or musicians do you consider major influences?   Cassie: There isn't a specific artist, but I've been influenced a lot by anisongs and J-Pop as a genre. Although I'm Canadian, I've loved anime and games since I was a kid, so I generally listened to anisongs. Anisongs are distinctive for their strong melodies. You don't find songs with such a feeling of presence in the west. It was very novel to me as a child. I suppose that's why Mili songs always have a strong melody line? My flashy melodies complement Kasai's classic and rock band experience. I think that's the source of Mili's unique sound today.    Can you recommend “The Executioner and Her Way of Life” to the western audience？   Cassie: I've seen the completed footage with my own eyes. So I can say this: The animation is sooooo pretty! It's a very impressive show, well worth watching, with solid action scenes. The musical score is a perfect match for each scene, which raises the excitement.    It's an easy anime to get into while also having a very intricate plot and setting. There's a lot of depth to the story. I can absolutely recommend it to people who love fantasy. Even people who don't have much interest in orthodox fantasy or the isekai genre ought to take the opportunity to watch it. It might become a new love for you.    Make sure to watch The Executioner and Her Way of Life!    The Executioner and Her Way of Life will stream on HIDIVE   Readers can find Mili on YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music.     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Theme Song Band Mili   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022          International indie rockers Mili made their anisong debut in the 2016 series Bloodivores and have since gone on to contribute themes for  Goblin Slayer, Gleipnir, amd Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045. The group's newest song ""Paper Bouquet"" will be featured as the opening theme in the upcoming anime series The Executioner and Her Way of Life and is available digitally today.    Anime News Network had the opportunity to interview the group's lead vocalist Cassie Wei about the band's unique sound, her anime and manga recommendations, and the upcoming series.    The group 'Mili' formed in 2012, can you tell us how you each met and about the formation of the group?   Cassie Wei: Around a year or two before Mili was formed, I was making covers of Kasai's Vocaloid songs and posting them on YouTube. At the time, I was in high school, and Kasai was using a different name. When he saw my videos, he got in contact with me through Twitter. He invited me to join his new unit afterwards. It sounded fun so I immediately said yes (laughs). It genuinely has been a lot of fun.    After that, Kasai invited some of his former bandmates: bassist Yukihito and drummer Shoto. Together, we formed Mili, and when we were producing our first album, we had the opportunity to bring the illustrator Ao on board.    Can you talk about your group name, ""Mili"" and the inspiration from the Grimm fairytale? How does the group name represent your music?   Cassie: The Grimm fairytale ""Dear Mili"" is honestly quite an offbeat story, in my opinion (laughs). The message isn't clear, nor does it tell you what the protagonist Mili was feeling, or whether the ending was happy or bad. Yet it's a mysterious tale through which you can feel a sense of beauty. I think that this beautiful yet eerily bizarre aspect is a good match for our style of music.    Vocalist Cassie Wei is multi-talented; on top of singing she also has a degree in software engineering. Does she still have goals of creating computer games in the future?   Cassie: Lately, I've been wanting to express my values in a more easy-to-digest format. I love games, of course, and I think it's an excellent medium for deep-diving into a world, but it takes such a long time before you can show your work to other people, so I realized it was unsuited for me. There are so many ideas in my head that I want to express and so many messages I want to convey that it all threatens to get buried. Every day I think of some new kind of story. If I spend too much time on each individual thing, then (as far as I am concerned) I would turn into someone who can't give shape to their ideas. I think that's why I made the switch to writing songs.    How would you describe the mood of your song ""Paper Bouquet?""   Cassie: Fortitude, intensity, and a bit of poignancy, I suppose?    Were there any notes or directions provided by the anime staff for creating the song?   Cassie: We received some advice for the composition from the production side, but they generally left things up to Mili. I have so much gratitude for the production staff who believed in our sound.    Are any of the members anime, manga, or light novel fans? What are some of your favorites?   Cassie: All the members are otaku of some kind (laughs). Although everyone's into different genres. When I was in elementary school, I watched so much anime every day, and I'd even read manga in the bathtub. These days, I'm a fan of Shūzō Oshimi's Blood on the Tracks. I think it's great how it expresses the story and the feelings of the characters not through words but through images.     Are there any anime theme songs that you consider 'iconic' or that you listen to often?   Cassie: I'm quite the anime otaku, so there are way too many songs for comfort (laughs). When I was a kid, Yuki Kajiura's “Akatsuki no Kuruma” (from Mobile Suit Gundam Seed) was a masterpiece to me. Also, when I was in elementary school, I watched Destiny of the Shrine Maiden (not an anime an elementary schoolchild should watch, by the way). I was a huge fan of the ED song “Agony” performed by KOTOKO.    What bands or musicians do you consider major influences?   Cassie: There isn't a specific artist, but I've been influenced a lot by anisongs and J-Pop as a genre. Although I'm Canadian, I've loved anime and games since I was a kid, so I generally listened to anisongs. Anisongs are distinctive for their strong melodies. You don't find songs with such a feeling of presence in the west. It was very novel to me as a child. I suppose that's why Mili songs always have a strong melody line? My flashy melodies complement Kasai's classic and rock band experience. I think that's the source of Mili's unique sound today.    Can you recommend “The Executioner and Her Way of Life” to the western audience？   Cassie: I've seen the completed footage with my own eyes. So I can say this: The animation is sooooo pretty! It's a very impressive show, well worth watching, with solid action scenes. The musical score is a perfect match for each scene, which raises the excitement.    It's an easy anime to get into while also having a very intricate plot and setting. There's a lot of depth to the story. I can absolutely recommend it to people who love fantasy. Even people who don't have much interest in orthodox fantasy or the isekai genre ought to take the opportunity to watch it. It might become a new love for you.    Make sure to watch The Executioner and Her Way of Life!    The Executioner and Her Way of Life will stream on HIDIVE   Readers can find Mili on YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music.     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Theme Song Band Mili   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022          International indie rockers Mili made their anisong debut in the 2016 series Bloodivores and have since gone on to contribute themes for  Goblin Slayer, Gleipnir, amd Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045. The group's newest song ""Paper Bouquet"" will be featured as the opening theme in the upcoming anime series The Executioner and Her Way of Life and is available digitally today.    Anime News Network had the opportunity to interview the group's lead vocalist Cassie Wei about the band's unique sound, her anime and manga recommendations, and the upcoming series.    The group 'Mili' formed in 2012, can you tell us how you each met and about the formation of the group?   Cassie Wei: Around a year or two before Mili was formed, I was making covers of Kasai's Vocaloid songs and posting them on YouTube. At the time, I was in high school, and Kasai was using a different name. When he saw my videos, he got in contact with me through Twitter. He invited me to join his new unit afterwards. It sounded fun so I immediately said yes (laughs). It genuinely has been a lot of fun.    After that, Kasai invited some of his former bandmates: bassist Yukihito and drummer Shoto. Together, we formed Mili, and when we were producing our first album, we had the opportunity to bring the illustrator Ao on board.    Can you talk about your group name, ""Mili"" and the inspiration from the Grimm fairytale? How does the group name represent your music?   Cassie: The Grimm fairytale ""Dear Mili"" is honestly quite an offbeat story, in my opinion (laughs). The message isn't clear, nor does it tell you what the protagonist Mili was feeling, or whether the ending was happy or bad. Yet it's a mysterious tale through which you can feel a sense of beauty. I think that this beautiful yet eerily bizarre aspect is a good match for our style of music.    Vocalist Cassie Wei is multi-talented; on top of singing she also has a degree in software engineering. Does she still have goals of creating computer games in the future?   Cassie: Lately, I've been wanting to express my values in a more easy-to-digest format. I love games, of course, and I think it's an excellent medium for deep-diving into a world, but it takes such a long time before you can show your work to other people, so I realized it was unsuited for me. There are so many ideas in my head that I want to express and so many messages I want to convey that it all threatens to get buried. Every day I think of some new kind of story. If I spend too much time on each individual thing, then (as far as I am concerned) I would turn into someone who can't give shape to their ideas. I think that's why I made the switch to writing songs.    How would you describe the mood of your song ""Paper Bouquet?""   Cassie: Fortitude, intensity, and a bit of poignancy, I suppose?    Were there any notes or directions provided by the anime staff for creating the song?   Cassie: We received some advice for the composition from the production side, but they generally left things up to Mili. I have so much gratitude for the production staff who believed in our sound.    Are any of the members anime, manga, or light novel fans? What are some of your favorites?   Cassie: All the members are otaku of some kind (laughs). Although everyone's into different genres. When I was in elementary school, I watched so much anime every day, and I'd even read manga in the bathtub. These days, I'm a fan of Shūzō Oshimi's Blood on the Tracks. I think it's great how it expresses the story and the feelings of the characters not through words but through images.     Are there any anime theme songs that you consider 'iconic' or that you listen to often?   Cassie: I'm quite the anime otaku, so there are way too many songs for comfort (laughs). When I was a kid, Yuki Kajiura's “Akatsuki no Kuruma” (from Mobile Suit Gundam Seed) was a masterpiece to me. Also, when I was in elementary school, I watched Destiny of the Shrine Maiden (not an anime an elementary schoolchild should watch, by the way). I was a huge fan of the ED song “Agony” performed by KOTOKO.    What bands or musicians do you consider major influences?   Cassie: There isn't a specific artist, but I've been influenced a lot by anisongs and J-Pop as a genre. Although I'm Canadian, I've loved anime and games since I was a kid, so I generally listened to anisongs. Anisongs are distinctive for their strong melodies. You don't find songs with such a feeling of presence in the west. It was very novel to me as a child. I suppose that's why Mili songs always have a strong melody line? My flashy melodies complement Kasai's classic and rock band experience. I think that's the source of Mili's unique sound today.    Can you recommend “The Executioner and Her Way of Life” to the western audience？   Cassie: I've seen the completed footage with my own eyes. So I can say this: The animation is sooooo pretty! It's a very impressive show, well worth watching, with solid action scenes. The musical score is a perfect match for each scene, which raises the excitement.    It's an easy anime to get into while also having a very intricate plot and setting. There's a lot of depth to the story. I can absolutely recommend it to people who love fantasy. Even people who don't have much interest in orthodox fantasy or the isekai genre ought to take the opportunity to watch it. It might become a new love for you.    Make sure to watch The Executioner and Her Way of Life!    The Executioner and Her Way of Life will stream on HIDIVE   Readers can find Mili on YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music.     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

It's an easy anime to get into while also having a very intricate plot and setting. There's a lot of depth to the story. I can absolutely recommend it to people who love fantasy. Even people who don't have much interest in orthodox fantasy or the isekai genre ought to take the opportunity to watch it. It might become a new love for you.

09-04-2022,anime,9,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2022-03-31/the-executioner-and-her-way-of-life-theme-song-band-mili/.184237,The Executioner and Her Way of Life Theme Song Band Mili - Anime News Network:SEA,"       International indie rockers Mili made their anisong debut in the 2016 series Bloodivores and have since gone on to contribute themes for  Goblin Slayer, Gleipnir, amd Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045. The group's newest song ""Paper Bouquet"" will be featured as the opening theme in the upcoming anime series The Executioner and Her Way of Life and is available digitally today.    Anime News Network had the opportunity to interview the group's lead vocalist Cassie Wei about the band's unique sound, her anime and manga recommendations, and the upcoming series.    The group 'Mili' formed in 2012, can you tell us how you each met and about the formation of the group?   Cassie Wei: Around a year or two before Mili was formed, I was making covers of Kasai's Vocaloid songs and posting them on YouTube. At the time, I was in high school, and Kasai was using a different name. When he saw my videos, he got in contact with me through Twitter. He invited me to join his new unit afterwards. It sounded fun so I immediately said yes (laughs). It genuinely has been a lot of fun.    After that, Kasai invited some of his former bandmates: bassist Yukihito and drummer Shoto. Together, we formed Mili, and when we were producing our first album, we had the opportunity to bring the illustrator Ao on board.    Can you talk about your group name, ""Mili"" and the inspiration from the Grimm fairytale? How does the group name represent your music?   Cassie: The Grimm fairytale ""Dear Mili"" is honestly quite an offbeat story, in my opinion (laughs). The message isn't clear, nor does it tell you what the protagonist Mili was feeling, or whether the ending was happy or bad. Yet it's a mysterious tale through which you can feel a sense of beauty. I think that this beautiful yet eerily bizarre aspect is a good match for our style of music.    Vocalist Cassie Wei is multi-talented; on top of singing she also has a degree in software engineering. Does she still have goals of creating computer games in the future?   Cassie: Lately, I've been wanting to express my values in a more easy-to-digest format. I love games, of course, and I think it's an excellent medium for deep-diving into a world, but it takes such a long time before you can show your work to other people, so I realized it was unsuited for me. There are so many ideas in my head that I want to express and so many messages I want to convey that it all threatens to get buried. Every day I think of some new kind of story. If I spend too much time on each individual thing, then (as far as I am concerned) I would turn into someone who can't give shape to their ideas. I think that's why I made the switch to writing songs.    How would you describe the mood of your song ""Paper Bouquet?""   Cassie: Fortitude, intensity, and a bit of poignancy, I suppose?    Were there any notes or directions provided by the anime staff for creating the song?   Cassie: We received some advice for the composition from the production side, but they generally left things up to Mili. I have so much gratitude for the production staff who believed in our sound.    Are any of the members anime, manga, or light novel fans? What are some of your favorites?   Cassie: All the members are otaku of some kind (laughs). Although everyone's into different genres. When I was in elementary school, I watched so much anime every day, and I'd even read manga in the bathtub. These days, I'm a fan of Shūzō Oshimi's Blood on the Tracks. I think it's great how it expresses the story and the feelings of the characters not through words but through images.     Are there any anime theme songs that you consider 'iconic' or that you listen to often?   Cassie: I'm quite the anime otaku, so there are way too many songs for comfort (laughs). When I was a kid, Yuki Kajiura's “Akatsuki no Kuruma” (from Mobile Suit Gundam Seed) was a masterpiece to me. Also, when I was in elementary school, I watched Destiny of the Shrine Maiden (not an anime an elementary schoolchild should watch, by the way). I was a huge fan of the ED song “Agony” performed by KOTOKO.    What bands or musicians do you consider major influences?   Cassie: There isn't a specific artist, but I've been influenced a lot by anisongs and J-Pop as a genre. Although I'm Canadian, I've loved anime and games since I was a kid, so I generally listened to anisongs. Anisongs are distinctive for their strong melodies. You don't find songs with such a feeling of presence in the west. It was very novel to me as a child. I suppose that's why Mili songs always have a strong melody line? My flashy melodies complement Kasai's classic and rock band experience. I think that's the source of Mili's unique sound today.    Can you recommend “The Executioner and Her Way of Life” to the western audience？   Cassie: I've seen the completed footage with my own eyes. So I can say this: The animation is sooooo pretty!

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 12  by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.9            Now we approach the winter of our discontent, which is to say that this episode brings us out of Henry VI Part Three and into Richard III in terms of source material. That seems fitting for the finale of the first part of the series as it marks an emotional turning point for Richard. He has only recently realized that he loves Henry, only to find out that his love is in fact the man he blames for York's death (even if it was actually Margaret), that Anne has betrayed him, and that his Edward was actually the prince, all in almost the same breath. It's a lot to handle even if you aren't as emotionally unstable as Richard is after years of his mother's emotional abuse, and the return of his abuser into his life certainly isn't going to help him to cope with anything.    And so he turns to violence, which has become his go-to method for coping with things he can't actually handle. We've seen evidence of that from early episodes; while Richard is more than capable of emotional manipulation and other forms of machination, the Wars of the Roses have mostly offered him a bloody way out of his perceived helplessness. Even if he hadn't experienced some sort of psychotic break after the death of his father (which is debatable) he's not in a great position of mental health, and when we saw him run Prince Edward through, it looked an awful lot like the frustration of his miserable situation simply overwhelming him. He was lashing out in response to emotional pain, and that's what he does again when he visits Henry in the Tower – when Henry begins repeating Cecily's words about how cursed and evil Richard is and how the world would rue the day of his birth, Richard can't handle it. He's once again hearing hatred spewed from a mouth that should have spoken of love (and in this case actually did), and the only thing that he can think to do in the moment is to just make it stop.    What makes this particularly awful is that kissing Richard and moving their relationship from the (perception of) platonic to romantic is what causes Henry to begin repeating Cecily in the first place. Henry was traumatized by his mother Queen Catherine's affair, which in Requiem of the Rose King caused him to instead embrace as sexless a life as he could manage, believing it to be more pure and honest than an act that made his mother say such awful things. But when he kisses Richard, he's forced to accept that he also has those lusts within him, something he's been denying for a very long time, and all of that old trauma comes rushing back. His words are less an indictment of Richard and more an agony directed at himself for breaking from his beliefs. Unfortunately for him, Richard has his own trauma, and hearing the man he loves repeat his mother's imprecations is more than he can handle, especially right now.    It is, however, worth remembering what Catesby said to him before he forced his way into the Tower – that he had prepared a corpse to look like Henry. We do see Richard stab Henry and Henry fall over, but we never specifically see Henry's dead body, and when Anne is weeping by the red rose-draped coffin in the forest, Richard is quick to tell her that this is not Henry. Anne interprets that as Henry's mortal shell – that which made him “Henry” – having left, but strictly speaking, that may not be what Richard means. As well, I could see the series playing with the fact that Henry VI was interred in Chertsey Abbey but later moved to Windsor Castle's St. George's Chapel by Richard III as a means to back up the potential idea of Henry only being mostly dead.    In any event, the title for this episode tells things truly: the Richard we've known thus far may well be dead, or at least on his way towards dying. Anne may be able to help salvage what's left of his gentleness (even if she does appear to be in the early stages of pregnancy), but right now that doesn't feel all that likely. It seems instead that he's beginning to embody some of the last words he speaks to Henry in Henry VI Part Three: “And this word 'love,' which greybeards call divine,/ Be resident in men like one another/ And not in me: I am myself alone.”    “I am myself alone.” Does that mean that he is no one but himself? Or that he feels himself alone and friendless, adrift in an unwelcoming world? Either could be true. Time will show us which it is.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 12  by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.9            Now we approach the winter of our discontent, which is to say that this episode brings us out of Henry VI Part Three and into Richard III in terms of source material. That seems fitting for the finale of the first part of the series as it marks an emotional turning point for Richard. He has only recently realized that he loves Henry, only to find out that his love is in fact the man he blames for York's death (even if it was actually Margaret), that Anne has betrayed him, and that his Edward was actually the prince, all in almost the same breath. It's a lot to handle even if you aren't as emotionally unstable as Richard is after years of his mother's emotional abuse, and the return of his abuser into his life certainly isn't going to help him to cope with anything.    And so he turns to violence, which has become his go-to method for coping with things he can't actually handle. We've seen evidence of that from early episodes; while Richard is more than capable of emotional manipulation and other forms of machination, the Wars of the Roses have mostly offered him a bloody way out of his perceived helplessness. Even if he hadn't experienced some sort of psychotic break after the death of his father (which is debatable) he's not in a great position of mental health, and when we saw him run Prince Edward through, it looked an awful lot like the frustration of his miserable situation simply overwhelming him. He was lashing out in response to emotional pain, and that's what he does again when he visits Henry in the Tower – when Henry begins repeating Cecily's words about how cursed and evil Richard is and how the world would rue the day of his birth, Richard can't handle it. He's once again hearing hatred spewed from a mouth that should have spoken of love (and in this case actually did), and the only thing that he can think to do in the moment is to just make it stop.    What makes this particularly awful is that kissing Richard and moving their relationship from the (perception of) platonic to romantic is what causes Henry to begin repeating Cecily in the first place. Henry was traumatized by his mother Queen Catherine's affair, which in Requiem of the Rose King caused him to instead embrace as sexless a life as he could manage, believing it to be more pure and honest than an act that made his mother say such awful things. But when he kisses Richard, he's forced to accept that he also has those lusts within him, something he's been denying for a very long time, and all of that old trauma comes rushing back. His words are less an indictment of Richard and more an agony directed at himself for breaking from his beliefs. Unfortunately for him, Richard has his own trauma, and hearing the man he loves repeat his mother's imprecations is more than he can handle, especially right now.    It is, however, worth remembering what Catesby said to him before he forced his way into the Tower – that he had prepared a corpse to look like Henry. We do see Richard stab Henry and Henry fall over, but we never specifically see Henry's dead body, and when Anne is weeping by the red rose-draped coffin in the forest, Richard is quick to tell her that this is not Henry. Anne interprets that as Henry's mortal shell – that which made him “Henry” – having left, but strictly speaking, that may not be what Richard means. As well, I could see the series playing with the fact that Henry VI was interred in Chertsey Abbey but later moved to Windsor Castle's St. George's Chapel by Richard III as a means to back up the potential idea of Henry only being mostly dead.    In any event, the title for this episode tells things truly: the Richard we've known thus far may well be dead, or at least on his way towards dying. Anne may be able to help salvage what's left of his gentleness (even if she does appear to be in the early stages of pregnancy), but right now that doesn't feel all that likely. It seems instead that he's beginning to embody some of the last words he speaks to Henry in Henry VI Part Three: “And this word 'love,' which greybeards call divine,/ Be resident in men like one another/ And not in me: I am myself alone.”    “I am myself alone.” Does that mean that he is no one but himself? Or that he feels himself alone and friendless, adrift in an unwelcoming world? Either could be true. Time will show us which it is.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 12  by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.9            Now we approach the winter of our discontent, which is to say that this episode brings us out of Henry VI Part Three and into Richard III in terms of source material. That seems fitting for the finale of the first part of the series as it marks an emotional turning point for Richard. He has only recently realized that he loves Henry, only to find out that his love is in fact the man he blames for York's death (even if it was actually Margaret), that Anne has betrayed him, and that his Edward was actually the prince, all in almost the same breath. It's a lot to handle even if you aren't as emotionally unstable as Richard is after years of his mother's emotional abuse, and the return of his abuser into his life certainly isn't going to help him to cope with anything.    And so he turns to violence, which has become his go-to method for coping with things he can't actually handle. We've seen evidence of that from early episodes; while Richard is more than capable of emotional manipulation and other forms of machination, the Wars of the Roses have mostly offered him a bloody way out of his perceived helplessness. Even if he hadn't experienced some sort of psychotic break after the death of his father (which is debatable) he's not in a great position of mental health, and when we saw him run Prince Edward through, it looked an awful lot like the frustration of his miserable situation simply overwhelming him. He was lashing out in response to emotional pain, and that's what he does again when he visits Henry in the Tower – when Henry begins repeating Cecily's words about how cursed and evil Richard is and how the world would rue the day of his birth, Richard can't handle it. He's once again hearing hatred spewed from a mouth that should have spoken of love (and in this case actually did), and the only thing that he can think to do in the moment is to just make it stop.    What makes this particularly awful is that kissing Richard and moving their relationship from the (perception of) platonic to romantic is what causes Henry to begin repeating Cecily in the first place. Henry was traumatized by his mother Queen Catherine's affair, which in Requiem of the Rose King caused him to instead embrace as sexless a life as he could manage, believing it to be more pure and honest than an act that made his mother say such awful things. But when he kisses Richard, he's forced to accept that he also has those lusts within him, something he's been denying for a very long time, and all of that old trauma comes rushing back. His words are less an indictment of Richard and more an agony directed at himself for breaking from his beliefs. Unfortunately for him, Richard has his own trauma, and hearing the man he loves repeat his mother's imprecations is more than he can handle, especially right now.    It is, however, worth remembering what Catesby said to him before he forced his way into the Tower – that he had prepared a corpse to look like Henry. We do see Richard stab Henry and Henry fall over, but we never specifically see Henry's dead body, and when Anne is weeping by the red rose-draped coffin in the forest, Richard is quick to tell her that this is not Henry. Anne interprets that as Henry's mortal shell – that which made him “Henry” – having left, but strictly speaking, that may not be what Richard means. As well, I could see the series playing with the fact that Henry VI was interred in Chertsey Abbey but later moved to Windsor Castle's St. George's Chapel by Richard III as a means to back up the potential idea of Henry only being mostly dead.    In any event, the title for this episode tells things truly: the Richard we've known thus far may well be dead, or at least on his way towards dying. Anne may be able to help salvage what's left of his gentleness (even if she does appear to be in the early stages of pregnancy), but right now that doesn't feel all that likely. It seems instead that he's beginning to embody some of the last words he speaks to Henry in Henry VI Part Three: “And this word 'love,' which greybeards call divine,/ Be resident in men like one another/ And not in me: I am myself alone.”    “I am myself alone.” Does that mean that he is no one but himself? Or that he feels himself alone and friendless, adrift in an unwelcoming world? Either could be true. Time will show us which it is.

Founded in 1998, Anime News Network is the world's leading source of up to date news and information on the anime and manga industries. Regular readers of Anime News Network not only include hundreds of thousands of anime fans, but also all of the industry heavy weights. The past several years have witnessed an attrition of English anime news sites on the Internet; as the number of sites shrink, the remaining sites only get better. Consistently growing and improving, Anime News Network is here to stay. The key benefit in advertising on Anime News Network is that our readership fits a particular demographic; mature anime fans. The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN. Provide ANN with up to $5,000 of advertising in your program guide or on site, and we will provide you an equal value on ANN.  Other Anime, manga and geek culture conventions: We provide a 50% trade with no max value. You can pay for half the value of your advertisements on ANN with advertisements in your program guide or on-site. EG: If you give us $5,000 of ads at the convention, you only have to pay us $5,000 for $10,000 worth of advertising on ANN.  For Networks We are not looking for any advertising networks at this time. Agencies and rep firms are welcome to contact us, but no networks/exchanges/rtb platforms. No Bootlegs! No Pirates! Important: Don't waste our time if you sell bootleg/pirate DVDs or host unlicensed content on your website. Not only will we not allow you to advertise with us, but we'll probably report you to the appropriate authorities, licensors and/or licensees. We do not consider gray market imports of otherwise legal goods, or doujinshi, ""bootlegs,"" although we may require potential advertisers to prove that their gray market imports are legal goods.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Founded in 1998, Anime News Network is the world's leading source of up to date news and information on the anime and manga industries. Regular readers of Anime News Network not only include hundreds of thousands of anime fans, but also all of the industry heavy weights. The past several years have witnessed an attrition of English anime news sites on the Internet; as the number of sites shrink, the remaining sites only get better. Consistently growing and improving, Anime News Network is here to stay. The key benefit in advertising on Anime News Network is that our readership fits a particular demographic; mature anime fans. The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN. Provide ANN with up to $5,000 of advertising in your program guide or on site, and we will provide you an equal value on ANN.  Other Anime, manga and geek culture conventions: We provide a 50% trade with no max value. You can pay for half the value of your advertisements on ANN with advertisements in your program guide or on-site. EG: If you give us $5,000 of ads at the convention, you only have to pay us $5,000 for $10,000 worth of advertising on ANN.  For Networks We are not looking for any advertising networks at this time. Agencies and rep firms are welcome to contact us, but no networks/exchanges/rtb platforms. No Bootlegs! No Pirates! Important: Don't waste our time if you sell bootleg/pirate DVDs or host unlicensed content on your website. Not only will we not allow you to advertise with us, but we'll probably report you to the appropriate authorities, licensors and/or licensees. We do not consider gray market imports of otherwise legal goods, or doujinshi, ""bootlegs,"" although we may require potential advertisers to prove that their gray market imports are legal goods.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Visit news.dexclub.com for all the latest news in Thai.                Advertising              Thank you for your interest in advertising on Anime News Network. Founded in 1998, Anime News Network is the world's leading source of up to date news and information on the anime and manga industries. Regular readers of Anime News Network not only include hundreds of thousands of anime fans, but also all of the industry heavy weights. The past several years have witnessed an attrition of English anime news sites on the Internet; as the number of sites shrink, the remaining sites only get better. Consistently growing and improving, Anime News Network is here to stay. The key benefit in advertising on Anime News Network is that our readership fits a particular demographic; mature anime fans. The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN. Provide ANN with up to $5,000 of advertising in your program guide or on site, and we will provide you an equal value on ANN.  Other Anime, manga and geek culture conventions: We provide a 50% trade with no max value. You can pay for half the value of your advertisements on ANN with advertisements in your program guide or on-site. EG: If you give us $5,000 of ads at the convention, you only have to pay us $5,000 for $10,000 worth of advertising on ANN.  For Networks We are not looking for any advertising networks at this time. Agencies and rep firms are welcome to contact us, but no networks/exchanges/rtb platforms. No Bootlegs! No Pirates! Important: Don't waste our time if you sell bootleg/pirate DVDs or host unlicensed content on your website. Not only will we not allow you to advertise with us, but we'll probably report you to the appropriate authorities, licensors and/or licensees. We do not consider gray market imports of otherwise legal goods, or doujinshi, ""bootlegs,"" although we may require potential advertisers to prove that their gray market imports are legal goods.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN.

You can pay for half the value of your advertisements on ANN with advertisements in your program guide or on-site. EG: If you give us $5,000 of ads at the convention, you only have to pay us $5,000 for $10,000 worth of advertising on ANN.  For Networks We are not looking for any advertising networks at this time.

Gundam Build Fighters and the Power of Toy Anime   by The Cartoon Cipher, Apr  1st 2022          Gundam is a mecha franchise that's been going strong for decades with amazing entries in all kinds of styles. Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories. Who wouldn't want a detailed, customizable, poseable statue of them that you can assemble piece by piece? The anime we'll be talking about today though is about the plastic toys themselves rather than the giant mechs, so it's a toy show through and through. It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla. I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Watch homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Gundam Build Fighters and the Power of Toy Anime   by The Cartoon Cipher, Apr  1st 2022          Gundam is a mecha franchise that's been going strong for decades with amazing entries in all kinds of styles. Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories. Who wouldn't want a detailed, customizable, poseable statue of them that you can assemble piece by piece? The anime we'll be talking about today though is about the plastic toys themselves rather than the giant mechs, so it's a toy show through and through. It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla. I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Watch homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Gundam Build Fighters and the Power of Toy Anime   by The Cartoon Cipher, Apr  1st 2022          Gundam is a mecha franchise that's been going strong for decades with amazing entries in all kinds of styles. Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories. Who wouldn't want a detailed, customizable, poseable statue of them that you can assemble piece by piece? The anime we'll be talking about today though is about the plastic toys themselves rather than the giant mechs, so it's a toy show through and through. It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla. I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Watch homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Gundam Build Fighters and the Power of Toy Anime   by The Cartoon Cipher, Apr  1st 2022          Gundam is a mecha franchise that's been going strong for decades with amazing entries in all kinds of styles. Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories. Who wouldn't want a detailed, customizable, poseable statue of them that you can assemble piece by piece? The anime we'll be talking about today though is about the plastic toys themselves rather than the giant mechs, so it's a toy show through and through. It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla. I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.

The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child).

A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general.

The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Watch homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Gundam Build Fighters and the Power of Toy Anime   by The Cartoon Cipher, Apr  1st 2022          Gundam is a mecha franchise that's been going strong for decades with amazing entries in all kinds of styles. Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories. Who wouldn't want a detailed, customizable, poseable statue of them that you can assemble piece by piece? The anime we'll be talking about today though is about the plastic toys themselves rather than the giant mechs, so it's a toy show through and through. It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla. I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades.

The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Watch homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,{}

Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories. Who wouldn't want a detailed, customizable, poseable statue of them that you can assemble piece by piece? The anime we'll be talking about today though is about the plastic toys themselves rather than the giant mechs, so it's a toy show through and through. It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla. I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them.

I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Watch homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}

Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories. Who wouldn't want a detailed, customizable, poseable statue of them that you can assemble piece by piece? The anime we'll be talking about today though is about the plastic toys themselves rather than the giant mechs, so it's a toy show through and through. It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla.

It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla. I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Watch homepage / archives   ",positive,en,{}

Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories.

It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories. Who wouldn't want a detailed, customizable, poseable statue of them that you can assemble piece by piece? The anime we'll be talking about today though is about the plastic toys themselves rather than the giant mechs, so it's a toy show through and through. It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla. I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.

Meaning that if you've been pouring a lot of time into on PS4 or PS5, none of that will carry over if you decide to move platforms. And not having cross-play won't help the games player count. And they seemed to pin all of this on having a separate PC team who is also on a separate development schedule, as a result of which new updates will hit the PC version a bit later than on consoles.

Meaning that if you've been pouring a lot of time into on PS4 or PS5, none of that will carry over if you decide to move platforms. And not having cross-play won't help the games player count. And they seemed to pin all of this on having a separate PC team who is also on a separate development schedule, as a result of which new updates will hit the PC version a bit later than on consoles.

Meaning that if you've been pouring a lot of time into on PS4 or PS5, none of that will carry over if you decide to move platforms. And not having cross-play won't help the games player count. And they seemed to pin all of this on having a separate PC team who is also on a separate development schedule, as a result of which new updates will hit the PC version a bit later than on consoles.

News Toonami Airs Lupin III Part 6 Anime on April 16   posted on 2022-04-08 22:44 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Anime premiered on October 6    The official Facebook page for Adult Swim's Toonami programming block announced on Thursday that it will begin airing the Lupin the 3rd Part 6 anime on April 16 at 1:30 a.m. EDT (effectively, April 15).    The full lineup for April 16 includes:   12:00AM – Shenmue: The Animation 12:30AM – Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 1:00AM – Assassination Classroom 1:30AM – Lupin the 3rd Part 6 2:00AM  – One Piece 2:30AM – One Piece 3:00AM –  Naruto Shippūden 3:30AM  –  Cowboy Bebop   The anime premiered on October 6, and aired for a half-year continuous run, with the second half premiering in January. Sentai Filmworks licensed the new series for home video and streaming in North America, Australia, New Zealand, Scandinavian countries, and all Nordic Countries, and HIDIVE streamed the anime.    Sentai Filmworks describes the story:  Gentleman thief Lupin III is back and ready for his next caper— unless legendary sleuth, Sherlock Holmes, has anything to say about it! When Holmes' longtime partner, Dr. Watson, is murdered, none other than Lupin tops the suspects list. With Holmes fast closing in, Lupin must prove his innocence and bring a shadowy organization called The Raven to heel if he wants to live to steal another day.  Eiji Suganuma (Lupin III: Prison of the Past) directed the series at TMS Entertainment. Takahiro Ōkura (Lupin the Third: Part 5) was in charge of the series scripts.  Hirotaka Marufuji (Lupin III: Goodbye Partner) designed the characters. Yuji Ohno (Lupin III) composed the music. The late Monkey Punch is credited for the original work.      The new season commemorates the original anime's 50th anniversary.

Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ?                     Community score: 4.3            ""Companies don't necessarily stay the same forever"" is the wisdom dispensed as Miss Kuroitsu and the Monster Development crew sit on the precipice of potential change here in this final episode of the show. Superhero stories like the ones this show riffs on are usually built on some sort of stock status quo, but everything needs to get upended in time for a finale eventually. Obviously this isn't the actual ending for Miss Kuroitsu; the original manga is still ongoing and the episode makes it clear that the odd antics will continue (with several plot threads, such as this series has had them, still very much unresolved). But still, this season-ender plays at the idea of shifts in series like these, and the big climactic finishes that can come as a result of those setups. It is pretty much the exact kind of ending I could have asked for from this show.    One of the more clever elements of this finale is how they fully integrate the 'business' and 'super-villain' gimmicks for this one. Mergers and Acquisitions are an expected part of corporate business, but you've probably never seen a takeover quite this hostile! The story isn't even singularly oppositional to the idea of Agastia getting absorbed into Zet Arc at the beginning either; points are made about the benefit of resources they'd receive, something we know the Monster Development team has struggled with all season. Instead, the main contention comes down to the subject of attitude we've followed before: Agastia may be evil, but they try not to be jerks about it, while these Zet Arc guys are downright unpleasant. Every good business has principles they've got to stick by, and as we find out later in the episode, Zet Arc doesn't even have any respect for monsters or the fine craft behind them. Truly unforgivable.    This is all brisk setup in service of a big final battle that can bring together all the disparate players, hero or villain, from this series to unite against Zet Arc. Even as average-looking as Miss Kuroitsu has always been, the spectacle is still sold well enough this episode (and it looks a damn sight better than last week's), mostly on account of just how much is getting thrown on the screen. It's got that strong 'Everyone is here!' sense, with the magical girls, Black Lore, and eventually Blader himself jumping in not out of any aligned agendas, but simply because they're all in agreement about how much Zet Arc sucks.    There's an appreciation here for the motivational relationship between heroes and villains in toku-style shows among all the other elements that Miss Kuroitsu has lovingly embraced about the medium. Good or Evil, those sides are ostensibly both loved by the audience regardless because they're both essential to the entertainment. Apart from the main characters on display here, this final battle takes an extended period to montage across all the Local Heroes, and their accompanying villains, that the show has touched on across its run. It's a fine indulgence in a finale like this, coming off like a genuine tribute to the very institution of tokusatsu action this series is founded on. Those sorts of live local suit-action performances are often reliant on eliciting audience cheers throughout them, and you get the sense the creators of Miss Kuroitsu here were trying to get that sort of reaction even from the kids and adults watching along at home.    Not only does it succeed as a parade of real-life character cameos, but it relates back to its own story as well. Anybody who follows shows like this knows it's a big deal when a character gets their own new transformational toy, and who else but Miss Kuroitsu herself would obtain such a thing for the big finish here? It even ties in with the mechanics of the show, what with the power-up item is itself a 'monster' that we saw the Development Team working on earlier, and what else would we expect from a villainous group's final plan than an evil version of the hero they oppose? Maybe Kuroitsu donning the Black Blader suit herself wasn't the original idea, but any good toku show knows to just run with whims that occur thanks to production weirdness. And as intended, it comes off as a total fist-pump moment when she actually teams up with Blader here instead of fighting against him like they always have.    That overall celebratory metatext is what does it for me with this finale. The leader of Zet Arc decries the stylings of these monsters and heroes as 'inefficient' and belittles the smaller budgets they're forced to work with, but we know that those 'limitations' are a lot of what make tokusatsu what it is. Those outlandish costumes and overt posing for attacks may be 'inefficient', but it's also dang cool, and having to work within the limits of budget constraints necessitates a lot of creativity. ""Monster development has infinite possibilities"" is the wisdom Miss Kuroitsu works with, and to the end, this has been a scrappy little show that proves that. It's hardly perfect, but it 'gets it', and appeals to fandom appreciation in that very earnest way.

Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ?                     Community score: 4.3            ""Companies don't necessarily stay the same forever"" is the wisdom dispensed as Miss Kuroitsu and the Monster Development crew sit on the precipice of potential change here in this final episode of the show. Superhero stories like the ones this show riffs on are usually built on some sort of stock status quo, but everything needs to get upended in time for a finale eventually. Obviously this isn't the actual ending for Miss Kuroitsu; the original manga is still ongoing and the episode makes it clear that the odd antics will continue (with several plot threads, such as this series has had them, still very much unresolved). But still, this season-ender plays at the idea of shifts in series like these, and the big climactic finishes that can come as a result of those setups. It is pretty much the exact kind of ending I could have asked for from this show.    One of the more clever elements of this finale is how they fully integrate the 'business' and 'super-villain' gimmicks for this one. Mergers and Acquisitions are an expected part of corporate business, but you've probably never seen a takeover quite this hostile! The story isn't even singularly oppositional to the idea of Agastia getting absorbed into Zet Arc at the beginning either; points are made about the benefit of resources they'd receive, something we know the Monster Development team has struggled with all season. Instead, the main contention comes down to the subject of attitude we've followed before: Agastia may be evil, but they try not to be jerks about it, while these Zet Arc guys are downright unpleasant. Every good business has principles they've got to stick by, and as we find out later in the episode, Zet Arc doesn't even have any respect for monsters or the fine craft behind them. Truly unforgivable.    This is all brisk setup in service of a big final battle that can bring together all the disparate players, hero or villain, from this series to unite against Zet Arc. Even as average-looking as Miss Kuroitsu has always been, the spectacle is still sold well enough this episode (and it looks a damn sight better than last week's), mostly on account of just how much is getting thrown on the screen. It's got that strong 'Everyone is here!' sense, with the magical girls, Black Lore, and eventually Blader himself jumping in not out of any aligned agendas, but simply because they're all in agreement about how much Zet Arc sucks.    There's an appreciation here for the motivational relationship between heroes and villains in toku-style shows among all the other elements that Miss Kuroitsu has lovingly embraced about the medium. Good or Evil, those sides are ostensibly both loved by the audience regardless because they're both essential to the entertainment. Apart from the main characters on display here, this final battle takes an extended period to montage across all the Local Heroes, and their accompanying villains, that the show has touched on across its run.

Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ?                     Community score: 4.3            ""Companies don't necessarily stay the same forever"" is the wisdom dispensed as Miss Kuroitsu and the Monster Development crew sit on the precipice of potential change here in this final episode of the show. Superhero stories like the ones this show riffs on are usually built on some sort of stock status quo, but everything needs to get upended in time for a finale eventually. Obviously this isn't the actual ending for Miss Kuroitsu; the original manga is still ongoing and the episode makes it clear that the odd antics will continue (with several plot threads, such as this series has had them, still very much unresolved). But still, this season-ender plays at the idea of shifts in series like these, and the big climactic finishes that can come as a result of those setups. It is pretty much the exact kind of ending I could have asked for from this show.    One of the more clever elements of this finale is how they fully integrate the 'business' and 'super-villain' gimmicks for this one. Mergers and Acquisitions are an expected part of corporate business, but you've probably never seen a takeover quite this hostile! The story isn't even singularly oppositional to the idea of Agastia getting absorbed into Zet Arc at the beginning either; points are made about the benefit of resources they'd receive, something we know the Monster Development team has struggled with all season. Instead, the main contention comes down to the subject of attitude we've followed before: Agastia may be evil, but they try not to be jerks about it, while these Zet Arc guys are downright unpleasant. Every good business has principles they've got to stick by, and as we find out later in the episode, Zet Arc doesn't even have any respect for monsters or the fine craft behind them. Truly unforgivable.    This is all brisk setup in service of a big final battle that can bring together all the disparate players, hero or villain, from this series to unite against Zet Arc. Even as average-looking as Miss Kuroitsu has always been, the spectacle is still sold well enough this episode (and it looks a damn sight better than last week's), mostly on account of just how much is getting thrown on the screen. It's got that strong 'Everyone is here!' sense, with the magical girls, Black Lore, and eventually Blader himself jumping in not out of any aligned agendas, but simply because they're all in agreement about how much Zet Arc sucks.    There's an appreciation here for the motivational relationship between heroes and villains in toku-style shows among all the other elements that Miss Kuroitsu has lovingly embraced about the medium. Good or Evil, those sides are ostensibly both loved by the audience regardless because they're both essential to the entertainment. Apart from the main characters on display here, this final battle takes an extended period to montage across all the Local Heroes, and their accompanying villains, that the show has touched on across its run. It's a fine indulgence in a finale like this, coming off like a genuine tribute to the very institution of tokusatsu action this series is founded on. Those sorts of live local suit-action performances are often reliant on eliciting audience cheers throughout them, and you get the sense the creators of Miss Kuroitsu here were trying to get that sort of reaction even from the kids and adults watching along at home.    Not only does it succeed as a parade of real-life character cameos, but it relates back to its own story as well. Anybody who follows shows like this knows it's a big deal when a character gets their own new transformational toy, and who else but Miss Kuroitsu herself would obtain such a thing for the big finish here? It even ties in with the mechanics of the show, what with the power-up item is itself a 'monster' that we saw the Development Team working on earlier, and what else would we expect from a villainous group's final plan than an evil version of the hero they oppose? Maybe Kuroitsu donning the Black Blader suit herself wasn't the original idea, but any good toku show knows to just run with whims that occur thanks to production weirdness. And as intended, it comes off as a total fist-pump moment when she actually teams up with Blader here instead of fighting against him like they always have.    That overall celebratory metatext is what does it for me with this finale. The leader of Zet Arc decries the stylings of these monsters and heroes as 'inefficient' and belittles the smaller budgets they're forced to work with, but we know that those 'limitations' are a lot of what make tokusatsu what it is. Those outlandish costumes and overt posing for attacks may be 'inefficient', but it's also dang cool, and having to work within the limits of budget constraints necessitates a lot of creativity. ""Monster development has infinite possibilities"" is the wisdom Miss Kuroitsu works with, and to the end, this has been a scrappy little show that proves that. It's hardly perfect, but it 'gets it', and appeals to fandom appreciation in that very earnest way.

The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt Episode 12  by Richard Eisenbeis, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ?                     Community score: 4.3           The biggest challenge when basing your entire story around a “genius character” is making them seem like a genius. All too often, being a genius either means having that character know things they couldn't possibly know or just having everyone else in the story be incompetent by comparison. Luckily, neither is the case here.    Over the course of the series, Wein has defeated several enemies on the battlefield despite being massively outnumbered. However, this time, it isn't the overconfident Mardens or a hastily assembled pursuit army from Cavarin. Rather, he faces the full force of Solgest—a country more powerful by far and with a King just as competent as Wein himself. To be frank, it is a war that Natra cannot hope to win and that is the crux of Wein's latest genius plan—well, one of them at least.    What's most interesting in this episode is the fact that Wein actually has several plans running concurrently. The most basic one is to make peace with Delunio—turning Solgest's invasion from a just one into an unjust one. To achieve that peace, he is willing to allow Zeno to give away a large portion of their territory—greatly undermining her hard-won power in the process. Unfortunately, Delunio's leader is having delusions of grandeur, certain that anything Wein could promise will be given freely by Solgest at the end of the war.    Thus, Wein moves on to a much more drastic plan—country-sized blackmail. If Natra falls, so will Delunio. Wein will use his civilian population as a weapon and cause a refugee crisis with the sole purpose of destabilizing Delunio—not only putting an end to any kind of personal ambitions the regent may have but making the country rife for outside invasion as well. What's great about this threat is that it mixes lies and truth. Sure, there is no plague-causing yellow fabric but Falanya did rally an entire population to march (and that wasn't even her own people).    The final nail in the coffin—the reason Delunio betrays Solgest—is thanks to Wein exploiting time-lagged communication and his enemy's morale-boosting propaganda. Delunio's own sources report that Natra is in full retreat. Thus, if Delunio doesn't march immediately, Natra will fall and the refugee crisis will begin.    Bringing Delunio onto his side isn't victory in the war, however. After all, King Solgest is Wein's equal on the battlefield—and his superior in actual combat. There is every possibility he could lead his army to victory despite the appearance of the Delunio army. However, herein lies Solgest's true weakness: without their King, they are nothing—just as Natra is nothing without Wein. The key to winning isn't bringing Delunio into the war but taking out King Solgest. As King Solgest is a man who lives for visceral pleasures—be that food or the thrill of battle—he leads from the front. Wein exploits this to lead the King into a trap where, after using himself as a distraction, his three best soldiers work together to bring the King down and win the day.    All in all, this episode ends The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt on a high note. We watch Wein face down someone who is his equal or superior in most ways—and win only because he is able to exploit a flaw in that person's personality. And even then, he doesn't come out of it unscathed. Wein is back where he started, the leader of a poor country just barely making ends meet—except now that territory is triple the size and his religious neighbors hate him. It's a fitting end for our arrogant, reluctant hero. At the very least, he won't be able to run away from his responsibilities any times soon.    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	Zeno could have so easily blamed Wein for the crisis with Delunio—and not have been entirely wrong to do so. Instead, she took responsibility for it. It just shows her strong character.    •	I couldn't help but notice when Ninym took out King Solgest, she was no longer wearing her disguise. So a Flam very publicly just defeated a ""Holy Elite."" No wonder the religious people are pissed at Natra.    •	It seems Wein didn't intend to kill King Solgest but I wonder what his plans were if he had been killed on accident.    •	Judging from King Solgest's reaction, I'm betting that Wein told him he planned to unify the continent and bring down the church—solely to end the oppression of the Fram people in general and Ninym in specific.    •	I wouldn't be surprised if King Solgest begins having his daughter court Wein aggressively after this. It would not only give him a spy but also a front row seat to Wein's ongoing conquests.    •	I loved that we got one final reminder that Caldmellia is the true big bad of this story and she is still out there and plotting.    •	Welp, thank you all for joining me on this fantastic ride. Let's hope another season gets made so we can do this again!       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt is currently streaming on Funimation.

Delunio's own sources report that Natra is in full retreat. Thus, if Delunio doesn't march immediately, Natra will fall and the refugee crisis will begin.    Bringing Delunio onto his side isn't victory in the war, however. After all, King Solgest is Wein's equal on the battlefield—and his superior in actual combat. There is every possibility he could lead his army to victory despite the appearance of the Delunio army. However, herein lies Solgest's true weakness: without their King, they are nothing—just as Natra is nothing without Wein. The key to winning isn't bringing Delunio into the war but taking out King Solgest. As King Solgest is a man who lives for visceral pleasures—be that food or the thrill of battle—he leads from the front. Wein exploits this to lead the King into a trap where, after using himself as a distraction, his three best soldiers work together to bring the King down and win the day.    All in all, this episode ends The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt on a high note. We watch Wein face down someone who is his equal or superior in most ways—and win only because he is able to exploit a flaw in that person's personality. And even then, he doesn't come out of it unscathed. Wein is back where he started, the leader of a poor country just barely making ends meet—except now that territory is triple the size and his religious neighbors hate him. It's a fitting end for our arrogant, reluctant hero. At the very least, he won't be able to run away from his responsibilities any times soon.    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	Zeno could have so easily blamed Wein for the crisis with Delunio—and not have been entirely wrong to do so. Instead, she took responsibility for it. It just shows her strong character.    •	I couldn't help but notice when Ninym took out King Solgest, she was no longer wearing her disguise. So a Flam very publicly just defeated a ""Holy Elite."" No wonder the religious people are pissed at Natra.    •	It seems Wein didn't intend to kill King Solgest but I wonder what his plans were if he had been killed on accident.    •	Judging from King Solgest's reaction, I'm betting that Wein told him he planned to unify the continent and bring down the church—solely to end the oppression of the Fram people in general and Ninym in specific.    •	I wouldn't be surprised if King Solgest begins having his daughter court Wein aggressively after this. It would not only give him a spy but also a front row seat to Wein's ongoing conquests.    •	I loved that we got one final reminder that Caldmellia is the true big bad of this story and she is still out there and plotting.    •	Welp, thank you all for joining me on this fantastic ride.

The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt Episode 12  by Richard Eisenbeis, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ?                     Community score: 4.3           The biggest challenge when basing your entire story around a “genius character” is making them seem like a genius. All too often, being a genius either means having that character know things they couldn't possibly know or just having everyone else in the story be incompetent by comparison. Luckily, neither is the case here.    Over the course of the series, Wein has defeated several enemies on the battlefield despite being massively outnumbered. However, this time, it isn't the overconfident Mardens or a hastily assembled pursuit army from Cavarin. Rather, he faces the full force of Solgest—a country more powerful by far and with a King just as competent as Wein himself. To be frank, it is a war that Natra cannot hope to win and that is the crux of Wein's latest genius plan—well, one of them at least.    What's most interesting in this episode is the fact that Wein actually has several plans running concurrently. The most basic one is to make peace with Delunio—turning Solgest's invasion from a just one into an unjust one. To achieve that peace, he is willing to allow Zeno to give away a large portion of their territory—greatly undermining her hard-won power in the process. Unfortunately, Delunio's leader is having delusions of grandeur, certain that anything Wein could promise will be given freely by Solgest at the end of the war.    Thus, Wein moves on to a much more drastic plan—country-sized blackmail. If Natra falls, so will Delunio. Wein will use his civilian population as a weapon and cause a refugee crisis with the sole purpose of destabilizing Delunio—not only putting an end to any kind of personal ambitions the regent may have but making the country rife for outside invasion as well. What's great about this threat is that it mixes lies and truth. Sure, there is no plague-causing yellow fabric but Falanya did rally an entire population to march (and that wasn't even her own people).    The final nail in the coffin—the reason Delunio betrays Solgest—is thanks to Wein exploiting time-lagged communication and his enemy's morale-boosting propaganda. Delunio's own sources report that Natra is in full retreat. Thus, if Delunio doesn't march immediately, Natra will fall and the refugee crisis will begin.    Bringing Delunio onto his side isn't victory in the war, however. After all, King Solgest is Wein's equal on the battlefield—and his superior in actual combat. There is every possibility he could lead his army to victory despite the appearance of the Delunio army. However, herein lies Solgest's true weakness: without their King, they are nothing—just as Natra is nothing without Wein. The key to winning isn't bringing Delunio into the war but taking out King Solgest. As King Solgest is a man who lives for visceral pleasures—be that food or the thrill of battle—he leads from the front. Wein exploits this to lead the King into a trap where, after using himself as a distraction, his three best soldiers work together to bring the King down and win the day.    All in all, this episode ends The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt on a high note. We watch Wein face down someone who is his equal or superior in most ways—and win only because he is able to exploit a flaw in that person's personality. And even then, he doesn't come out of it unscathed. Wein is back where he started, the leader of a poor country just barely making ends meet—except now that territory is triple the size and his religious neighbors hate him. It's a fitting end for our arrogant, reluctant hero. At the very least, he won't be able to run away from his responsibilities any times soon.

The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt Episode 12  by Richard Eisenbeis, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ?                     Community score: 4.3           The biggest challenge when basing your entire story around a “genius character” is making them seem like a genius. All too often, being a genius either means having that character know things they couldn't possibly know or just having everyone else in the story be incompetent by comparison. Luckily, neither is the case here.    Over the course of the series, Wein has defeated several enemies on the battlefield despite being massively outnumbered. However, this time, it isn't the overconfident Mardens or a hastily assembled pursuit army from Cavarin. Rather, he faces the full force of Solgest—a country more powerful by far and with a King just as competent as Wein himself. To be frank, it is a war that Natra cannot hope to win and that is the crux of Wein's latest genius plan—well, one of them at least.    What's most interesting in this episode is the fact that Wein actually has several plans running concurrently. The most basic one is to make peace with Delunio—turning Solgest's invasion from a just one into an unjust one. To achieve that peace, he is willing to allow Zeno to give away a large portion of their territory—greatly undermining her hard-won power in the process. Unfortunately, Delunio's leader is having delusions of grandeur, certain that anything Wein could promise will be given freely by Solgest at the end of the war.    Thus, Wein moves on to a much more drastic plan—country-sized blackmail. If Natra falls, so will Delunio. Wein will use his civilian population as a weapon and cause a refugee crisis with the sole purpose of destabilizing Delunio—not only putting an end to any kind of personal ambitions the regent may have but making the country rife for outside invasion as well. What's great about this threat is that it mixes lies and truth. Sure, there is no plague-causing yellow fabric but Falanya did rally an entire population to march (and that wasn't even her own people).    The final nail in the coffin—the reason Delunio betrays Solgest—is thanks to Wein exploiting time-lagged communication and his enemy's morale-boosting propaganda. Delunio's own sources report that Natra is in full retreat. Thus, if Delunio doesn't march immediately, Natra will fall and the refugee crisis will begin.    Bringing Delunio onto his side isn't victory in the war, however. After all, King Solgest is Wein's equal on the battlefield—and his superior in actual combat. There is every possibility he could lead his army to victory despite the appearance of the Delunio army. However, herein lies Solgest's true weakness: without their King, they are nothing—just as Natra is nothing without Wein. The key to winning isn't bringing Delunio into the war but taking out King Solgest. As King Solgest is a man who lives for visceral pleasures—be that food or the thrill of battle—he leads from the front. Wein exploits this to lead the King into a trap where, after using himself as a distraction, his three best soldiers work together to bring the King down and win the day.    All in all, this episode ends The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt on a high note. We watch Wein face down someone who is his equal or superior in most ways—and win only because he is able to exploit a flaw in that person's personality. And even then, he doesn't come out of it unscathed. Wein is back where he started, the leader of a poor country just barely making ends meet—except now that territory is triple the size and his religious neighbors hate him. It's a fitting end for our arrogant, reluctant hero. At the very least, he won't be able to run away from his responsibilities any times soon.    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	Zeno could have so easily blamed Wein for the crisis with Delunio—and not have been entirely wrong to do so. Instead, she took responsibility for it. It just shows her strong character.    •	I couldn't help but notice when Ninym took out King Solgest, she was no longer wearing her disguise. So a Flam very publicly just defeated a ""Holy Elite."" No wonder the religious people are pissed at Natra.    •	It seems Wein didn't intend to kill King Solgest but I wonder what his plans were if he had been killed on accident.    •	Judging from King Solgest's reaction, I'm betting that Wein told him he planned to unify the continent and bring down the church—solely to end the oppression of the Fram people in general and Ninym in specific.    •	I wouldn't be surprised if King Solgest begins having his daughter court Wein aggressively after this. It would not only give him a spy but also a front row seat to Wein's ongoing conquests.    •	I loved that we got one final reminder that Caldmellia is the true big bad of this story and she is still out there and plotting.    •	Welp, thank you all for joining me on this fantastic ride. Let's hope another season gets made so we can do this again!       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt is currently streaming on Funimation.

To achieve that peace, he is willing to allow Zeno to give away a large portion of their territory—greatly undermining her hard-won power in the process. Unfortunately, Delunio's leader is having delusions of grandeur, certain that anything Wein could promise will be given freely by Solgest at the end of the war.    Thus, Wein moves on to a much more drastic plan—country-sized blackmail. If Natra falls, so will Delunio. Wein will use his civilian population as a weapon and cause a refugee crisis with the sole purpose of destabilizing Delunio—not only putting an end to any kind of personal ambitions the regent may have but making the country rife for outside invasion as well. What's great about this threat is that it mixes lies and truth. Sure, there is no plague-causing yellow fabric but Falanya did rally an entire population to march (and that wasn't even her own people).    The final nail in the coffin—the reason Delunio betrays Solgest—is thanks to Wein exploiting time-lagged communication and his enemy's morale-boosting propaganda. Delunio's own sources report that Natra is in full retreat. Thus, if Delunio doesn't march immediately, Natra will fall and the refugee crisis will begin.    Bringing Delunio onto his side isn't victory in the war, however. After all, King Solgest is Wein's equal on the battlefield—and his superior in actual combat. There is every possibility he could lead his army to victory despite the appearance of the Delunio army. However, herein lies Solgest's true weakness: without their King, they are nothing—just as Natra is nothing without Wein. The key to winning isn't bringing Delunio into the war but taking out King Solgest. As King Solgest is a man who lives for visceral pleasures—be that food or the thrill of battle—he leads from the front. Wein exploits this to lead the King into a trap where, after using himself as a distraction, his three best soldiers work together to bring the King down and win the day.    All in all, this episode ends The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt on a high note. We watch Wein face down someone who is his equal or superior in most ways—and win only because he is able to exploit a flaw in that person's personality. And even then, he doesn't come out of it unscathed. Wein is back where he started, the leader of a poor country just barely making ends meet—except now that territory is triple the size and his religious neighbors hate him. It's a fitting end for our arrogant, reluctant hero. At the very least, he won't be able to run away from his responsibilities any times soon.    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	Zeno could have so easily blamed Wein for the crisis with Delunio—and not have been entirely wrong to do so. Instead, she took responsibility for it. It just shows her strong character.    •	I couldn't help but notice when Ninym took out King Solgest, she was no longer wearing her disguise. So a Flam very publicly just defeated a ""Holy Elite."" No wonder the religious people are pissed at Natra.    •	It seems Wein didn't intend to kill King Solgest but I wonder what his plans were if he had been killed on accident.    •	Judging from King Solgest's reaction, I'm betting that Wein told him he planned to unify the continent and bring down the church—solely to end the oppression of the Fram people in general and Ninym in specific.    •	I wouldn't be surprised if King Solgest begins having his daughter court Wein aggressively after this. It would not only give him a spy but also a front row seat to Wein's ongoing conquests.    •	I loved that we got one final reminder that Caldmellia is the true big bad of this story and she is still out there and plotting.    •	Welp, thank you all for joining me on this fantastic ride.

As King Solgest is a man who lives for visceral pleasures—be that food or the thrill of battle—he leads from the front. Wein exploits this to lead the King into a trap where, after using himself as a distraction, his three best soldiers work together to bring the King down and win the day.    All in all, this episode ends The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt on a high note. We watch Wein face down someone who is his equal or superior in most ways—and win only because he is able to exploit a flaw in that person's personality. And even then, he doesn't come out of it unscathed. Wein is back where he started, the leader of a poor country just barely making ends meet—except now that territory is triple the size and his religious neighbors hate him. It's a fitting end for our arrogant, reluctant hero. At the very least, he won't be able to run away from his responsibilities any times soon.    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	Zeno could have so easily blamed Wein for the crisis with Delunio—and not have been entirely wrong to do so. Instead, she took responsibility for it. It just shows her strong character.    •	I couldn't help but notice when Ninym took out King Solgest, she was no longer wearing her disguise. So a Flam very publicly just defeated a ""Holy Elite."" No wonder the religious people are pissed at Natra.    •	It seems Wein didn't intend to kill King Solgest but I wonder what his plans were if he had been killed on accident.    •	Judging from King Solgest's reaction, I'm betting that Wein told him he planned to unify the continent and bring down the church—solely to end the oppression of the Fram people in general and Ninym in specific.    •	I wouldn't be surprised if King Solgest begins having his daughter court Wein aggressively after this. It would not only give him a spy but also a front row seat to Wein's ongoing conquests.    •	I loved that we got one final reminder that Caldmellia is the true big bad of this story and she is still out there and plotting.    •	Welp, thank you all for joining me on this fantastic ride. Let's hope another season gets made so we can do this again!       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt is currently streaming on Funimation.

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 27th 2022       Soul Eater - The Perfect Edition GN 4-6                      Synopsis:             Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.      Review:         Synopsis:        Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.     Review:            Volume four of The Perfect Edition sees Soul Eater in pure, shonen action mode. It's the classic setup of an evil villain waiting at the end of a gauntlet of enemies, with each of our major characters getting a battle against an established baddie as they duke it out for the fate of the world. The main event is the rematch between Maka, Soul, and the Ragnarok duo, and it's some Grade A shonen fighting goodness. While the various beats it hits are pretty standard, they're delivered with the series' signature style and Ohkubo's exaggerated choreography, and thus land with a ton of impact, especially once “mad” Maka takes over and delivers some of the goofiest creepy-cute faces ever put to page.    Though the fight itself ends on a bit of a let down. Much is made about Maka resonating with Soul and giving into the black blood, but that ends up not mattering much as the fight resolves in a classic power of friendship conclusion. Don't get me wrong: Crona's backstory is emotionally affecting, and Maka reaching out to them with unconditional compassion is probably the best character moment in the series so far. But it doesn't quite match the tension and personal stakes that led up to it, and it leaves the whole black blood storyline feeling anticlimactic when it should be a huge turning point.    But the star of the show here is the Kishin himself, as the rest of the cast predictably fail to prevent his awakening. The sequence of Free and Eruka approaching his resting place is the most palpable horror in the manga so far, and it's followed up by a gloriously gross sequence of body horror as the Kishin literally puts himself back together skin-first. In classic Big Bad fashion he crushes our heroes with barely a whisper, and the only downside is that his fight with Lord Death has to be cut short so we can set up for the next arc. Again, that's predictable for this kind of shonen story, but it's still a tiny bit deflating to close things out with the new, dangerous villain running away. This is also supposed to be a sample of what Lord Death is capable of himself, and it winds up a pretty underwhelming showing for the guy.    Fittingly, Volume 5 is all about establishing the new conflict, introducing new characters on both sides as Ashura's awakening stirs up the rest of the world. On the good guys side, we're introduced to three of Lord Death's other Death Scythe weapons, each with their own quirks and powers. And like much of Ohkubo's extended cast, they're a mixed bag to start, as we initially learn about them through their singular comedic gimmicks. Marie Mjolnir has a great design and likable personality, but she's also obsessed with finding a husband, and that joke gets old fast. Similarly, Justin Law is a great fighter and has an interesting backstory as a solo Demon Weapon who became a Death Scythe at just 13, but his joke about always having his earbuds in wears out its welcome in record time. Azusa Yumi has probably the coolest powers of any Weapon outside Tsubaki, but is defined as the by-the-books straightwoman of the group and doesn't get much to do initially. They're not terrible, but by the end of the volume I was really wishing to see them get serious and stop goofing around. This formula works well with the kids because we already know their personalities beyond the tired gimmicks, but it's a chore to get through with a ton of new people.    The real treats come with the new villains introduced. Ashura himself is still off in the distance, but his resurrection spurs the revival of Arachne, a powerful spider-themed witch who immediately steals any page she's on. Her subordinate weapon, Giriko, leaves a little to be desired, as he initially just feels like a meaner version of Free. But his chainsaw powers make for some wild fights that more than made up for his retread personality. Their diminutive old butler(?) Mr. Mosquito has a striking, cartoony design that makes him stand out among Ohkubo's other villains, and his condescending attitude towards Giriko breathes a lot of life to this new primary villain group. Add in Medusa returning – by possessing the body of an innocent little girl, no less – and we have a great new villain group even before the return of Mifune, who's been forced to fight on their side under threat to Angela's life.    The following volume is more scattered, as we now need to introduce a common goal for the sides to scrap over while Ashura remains a looming hypothetical threat. This comes in the form of a search for the Demon Tools, designed centuries ago by a mysterious sorcerer named Eibon and scattered across the world. Volume 6 is bookended with two different quests for these tools, and makes for some of the best action in the series so far.    Kid's skateboard race against an enchanted train across the desert is a real highlight. It's a fast-paced and unique action setpiece, coupled with a three-way fight between Kid and both Arachne and Medusa's cronies that works as great spectacle and a nice highlight for the main kid who had the least to do in the previous arc. The closing battle in a snowy maelstrom doesn't get a conclusion in this volume, but it's got a lot of great, classic shonen moments for some of the side cast. Sid and his partner Mira, along with Death Scythe Azusa, have a fantastic and tactical fight against Mifune that shows off Ohkubo's improved eye for melee combat, packed with lots of inventive twists involving both the snowy landscape and Sid's zombie body. Meanwhile a secondary team of DWMA students actually get to shine instead of Maka and co, which is always welcome in battle series with huge casts. The big, important fight is of course being saved for our main crew, but it's still nice that Kirikou and his team can show off their stuff for a bit.    Outside of the action, the forces of darkness are still active in other ways. Ashura's awakening is causing a stirring of madness among the general populous, and especially in Dr. Stein, who's slowly being consumed by his inner darkness. But the real kicker is when Medusa slithers back into Crona's life just as they're starting to make friends at DWMA, and convinces her abused child to betray them and become her spy inside the school. After the progress we saw Crona make after their fight with Maka, it's genuinely heartbreaking to see this backslide, retreating into the madness and fear that once defined their entire personhood. It's by far the most affecting character arc right now by miles, easily eclipsing the rather pat teamwork lessons Maka and Black Star deal with during a training chapter here.    Unfortunately there is one big, obnoxious zit on volume six's face, and its name is Excalibur. For reasons I can't comprehend, the story interrupts itself for a full-length comedy chapter about Hero, a total gag character, teaming up with Excalibur to take over the school and get revenge on everyone who looks down on him. As somebody who also loves committing to overlong comedic bits for the sole purpose of annoying the reader, I can at least appreciate the idea behind Excalibur, but that doesn't make his dialogue any less of a chore to sit through. Add in some much un-needed skirt flipping and boob groping jokes and you have a chapter comprising all the worst elements of Soul Eater here, breaking up the rising tension of its story and character arcs. Maybe this would have worked better in the original collected volumes, but with The Perfect Edition's expanded chapter count per-book, it absolutely kills the tension while reading the volume on its own.    Other than that blemish, these volumes represent a solid, if somewhat inconsistent, new arc for Soul Eater's overarching story. The biggest complaint – besides Excalibur – is that the expanding scope of the story leaves Maka and Soul feeling underutilized and out of focus. That's perhaps to be expected as a series with such a huge cast goes on, but after their partnership defined so much of the conflict before this, it feels like the series doesn't quite know what to do with them besides occasionally hinting at the return of the black blood demon. But on its own, this is an effective, often thrilling chunk of storytelling and offers some fantastic highlights.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Story : B+ Art : A  + Entertaining new villains, fantastic action highlights, Crona's arc is the most compelling drama in the series so far − Some anticlimactic finishes, new heroes take some time to warm up to, Excalibur is here            discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Atsushi Ohkubo   Full encyclopedia details aboutSoul Eater (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 27th 2022       Soul Eater - The Perfect Edition GN 4-6                      Synopsis:             Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.      Review:         Synopsis:        Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.     Review:            Volume four of The Perfect Edition sees Soul Eater in pure, shonen action mode. It's the classic setup of an evil villain waiting at the end of a gauntlet of enemies, with each of our major characters getting a battle against an established baddie as they duke it out for the fate of the world. The main event is the rematch between Maka, Soul, and the Ragnarok duo, and it's some Grade A shonen fighting goodness. While the various beats it hits are pretty standard, they're delivered with the series' signature style and Ohkubo's exaggerated choreography, and thus land with a ton of impact, especially once “mad” Maka takes over and delivers some of the goofiest creepy-cute faces ever put to page.    Though the fight itself ends on a bit of a let down. Much is made about Maka resonating with Soul and giving into the black blood, but that ends up not mattering much as the fight resolves in a classic power of friendship conclusion. Don't get me wrong: Crona's backstory is emotionally affecting, and Maka reaching out to them with unconditional compassion is probably the best character moment in the series so far. But it doesn't quite match the tension and personal stakes that led up to it, and it leaves the whole black blood storyline feeling anticlimactic when it should be a huge turning point.    But the star of the show here is the Kishin himself, as the rest of the cast predictably fail to prevent his awakening. The sequence of Free and Eruka approaching his resting place is the most palpable horror in the manga so far, and it's followed up by a gloriously gross sequence of body horror as the Kishin literally puts himself back together skin-first. In classic Big Bad fashion he crushes our heroes with barely a whisper, and the only downside is that his fight with Lord Death has to be cut short so we can set up for the next arc. Again, that's predictable for this kind of shonen story, but it's still a tiny bit deflating to close things out with the new, dangerous villain running away. This is also supposed to be a sample of what Lord Death is capable of himself, and it winds up a pretty underwhelming showing for the guy.    Fittingly, Volume 5 is all about establishing the new conflict, introducing new characters on both sides as Ashura's awakening stirs up the rest of the world. On the good guys side, we're introduced to three of Lord Death's other Death Scythe weapons, each with their own quirks and powers. And like much of Ohkubo's extended cast, they're a mixed bag to start, as we initially learn about them through their singular comedic gimmicks. Marie Mjolnir has a great design and likable personality, but she's also obsessed with finding a husband, and that joke gets old fast. Similarly, Justin Law is a great fighter and has an interesting backstory as a solo Demon Weapon who became a Death Scythe at just 13, but his joke about always having his earbuds in wears out its welcome in record time. Azusa Yumi has probably the coolest powers of any Weapon outside Tsubaki, but is defined as the by-the-books straightwoman of the group and doesn't get much to do initially. They're not terrible, but by the end of the volume I was really wishing to see them get serious and stop goofing around. This formula works well with the kids because we already know their personalities beyond the tired gimmicks, but it's a chore to get through with a ton of new people.    The real treats come with the new villains introduced. Ashura himself is still off in the distance, but his resurrection spurs the revival of Arachne, a powerful spider-themed witch who immediately steals any page she's on. Her subordinate weapon, Giriko, leaves a little to be desired, as he initially just feels like a meaner version of Free. But his chainsaw powers make for some wild fights that more than made up for his retread personality. Their diminutive old butler(?) Mr. Mosquito has a striking, cartoony design that makes him stand out among Ohkubo's other villains, and his condescending attitude towards Giriko breathes a lot of life to this new primary villain group. Add in Medusa returning – by possessing the body of an innocent little girl, no less – and we have a great new villain group even before the return of Mifune, who's been forced to fight on their side under threat to Angela's life.    The following volume is more scattered, as we now need to introduce a common goal for the sides to scrap over while Ashura remains a looming hypothetical threat. This comes in the form of a search for the Demon Tools, designed centuries ago by a mysterious sorcerer named Eibon and scattered across the world. Volume 6 is bookended with two different quests for these tools, and makes for some of the best action in the series so far.    Kid's skateboard race against an enchanted train across the desert is a real highlight. It's a fast-paced and unique action setpiece, coupled with a three-way fight between Kid and both Arachne and Medusa's cronies that works as great spectacle and a nice highlight for the main kid who had the least to do in the previous arc. The closing battle in a snowy maelstrom doesn't get a conclusion in this volume, but it's got a lot of great, classic shonen moments for some of the side cast. Sid and his partner Mira, along with Death Scythe Azusa, have a fantastic and tactical fight against Mifune that shows off Ohkubo's improved eye for melee combat, packed with lots of inventive twists involving both the snowy landscape and Sid's zombie body. Meanwhile a secondary team of DWMA students actually get to shine instead of Maka and co, which is always welcome in battle series with huge casts. The big, important fight is of course being saved for our main crew, but it's still nice that Kirikou and his team can show off their stuff for a bit.    Outside of the action, the forces of darkness are still active in other ways. Ashura's awakening is causing a stirring of madness among the general populous, and especially in Dr. Stein, who's slowly being consumed by his inner darkness. But the real kicker is when Medusa slithers back into Crona's life just as they're starting to make friends at DWMA, and convinces her abused child to betray them and become her spy inside the school. After the progress we saw Crona make after their fight with Maka, it's genuinely heartbreaking to see this backslide, retreating into the madness and fear that once defined their entire personhood. It's by far the most affecting character arc right now by miles, easily eclipsing the rather pat teamwork lessons Maka and Black Star deal with during a training chapter here.    Unfortunately there is one big, obnoxious zit on volume six's face, and its name is Excalibur. For reasons I can't comprehend, the story interrupts itself for a full-length comedy chapter about Hero, a total gag character, teaming up with Excalibur to take over the school and get revenge on everyone who looks down on him. As somebody who also loves committing to overlong comedic bits for the sole purpose of annoying the reader, I can at least appreciate the idea behind Excalibur, but that doesn't make his dialogue any less of a chore to sit through. Add in some much un-needed skirt flipping and boob groping jokes and you have a chapter comprising all the worst elements of Soul Eater here, breaking up the rising tension of its story and character arcs. Maybe this would have worked better in the original collected volumes, but with The Perfect Edition's expanded chapter count per-book, it absolutely kills the tension while reading the volume on its own.    Other than that blemish, these volumes represent a solid, if somewhat inconsistent, new arc for Soul Eater's overarching story. The biggest complaint – besides Excalibur – is that the expanding scope of the story leaves Maka and Soul feeling underutilized and out of focus. That's perhaps to be expected as a series with such a huge cast goes on, but after their partnership defined so much of the conflict before this, it feels like the series doesn't quite know what to do with them besides occasionally hinting at the return of the black blood demon.

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 27th 2022       Soul Eater - The Perfect Edition GN 4-6                      Synopsis:             Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.      Review:         Synopsis:        Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.     Review:            Volume four of The Perfect Edition sees Soul Eater in pure, shonen action mode. It's the classic setup of an evil villain waiting at the end of a gauntlet of enemies, with each of our major characters getting a battle against an established baddie as they duke it out for the fate of the world. The main event is the rematch between Maka, Soul, and the Ragnarok duo, and it's some Grade A shonen fighting goodness. While the various beats it hits are pretty standard, they're delivered with the series' signature style and Ohkubo's exaggerated choreography, and thus land with a ton of impact, especially once “mad” Maka takes over and delivers some of the goofiest creepy-cute faces ever put to page.    Though the fight itself ends on a bit of a let down. Much is made about Maka resonating with Soul and giving into the black blood, but that ends up not mattering much as the fight resolves in a classic power of friendship conclusion. Don't get me wrong: Crona's backstory is emotionally affecting, and Maka reaching out to them with unconditional compassion is probably the best character moment in the series so far. But it doesn't quite match the tension and personal stakes that led up to it, and it leaves the whole black blood storyline feeling anticlimactic when it should be a huge turning point.    But the star of the show here is the Kishin himself, as the rest of the cast predictably fail to prevent his awakening. The sequence of Free and Eruka approaching his resting place is the most palpable horror in the manga so far, and it's followed up by a gloriously gross sequence of body horror as the Kishin literally puts himself back together skin-first. In classic Big Bad fashion he crushes our heroes with barely a whisper, and the only downside is that his fight with Lord Death has to be cut short so we can set up for the next arc. Again, that's predictable for this kind of shonen story, but it's still a tiny bit deflating to close things out with the new, dangerous villain running away. This is also supposed to be a sample of what Lord Death is capable of himself, and it winds up a pretty underwhelming showing for the guy.    Fittingly, Volume 5 is all about establishing the new conflict, introducing new characters on both sides as Ashura's awakening stirs up the rest of the world. On the good guys side, we're introduced to three of Lord Death's other Death Scythe weapons, each with their own quirks and powers. And like much of Ohkubo's extended cast, they're a mixed bag to start, as we initially learn about them through their singular comedic gimmicks. Marie Mjolnir has a great design and likable personality, but she's also obsessed with finding a husband, and that joke gets old fast. Similarly, Justin Law is a great fighter and has an interesting backstory as a solo Demon Weapon who became a Death Scythe at just 13, but his joke about always having his earbuds in wears out its welcome in record time. Azusa Yumi has probably the coolest powers of any Weapon outside Tsubaki, but is defined as the by-the-books straightwoman of the group and doesn't get much to do initially. They're not terrible, but by the end of the volume I was really wishing to see them get serious and stop goofing around. This formula works well with the kids because we already know their personalities beyond the tired gimmicks, but it's a chore to get through with a ton of new people.    The real treats come with the new villains introduced. Ashura himself is still off in the distance, but his resurrection spurs the revival of Arachne, a powerful spider-themed witch who immediately steals any page she's on. Her subordinate weapon, Giriko, leaves a little to be desired, as he initially just feels like a meaner version of Free. But his chainsaw powers make for some wild fights that more than made up for his retread personality. Their diminutive old butler(?) Mr. Mosquito has a striking, cartoony design that makes him stand out among Ohkubo's other villains, and his condescending attitude towards Giriko breathes a lot of life to this new primary villain group. Add in Medusa returning – by possessing the body of an innocent little girl, no less – and we have a great new villain group even before the return of Mifune, who's been forced to fight on their side under threat to Angela's life.    The following volume is more scattered, as we now need to introduce a common goal for the sides to scrap over while Ashura remains a looming hypothetical threat. This comes in the form of a search for the Demon Tools, designed centuries ago by a mysterious sorcerer named Eibon and scattered across the world. Volume 6 is bookended with two different quests for these tools, and makes for some of the best action in the series so far.    Kid's skateboard race against an enchanted train across the desert is a real highlight. It's a fast-paced and unique action setpiece, coupled with a three-way fight between Kid and both Arachne and Medusa's cronies that works as great spectacle and a nice highlight for the main kid who had the least to do in the previous arc. The closing battle in a snowy maelstrom doesn't get a conclusion in this volume, but it's got a lot of great, classic shonen moments for some of the side cast. Sid and his partner Mira, along with Death Scythe Azusa, have a fantastic and tactical fight against Mifune that shows off Ohkubo's improved eye for melee combat, packed with lots of inventive twists involving both the snowy landscape and Sid's zombie body. Meanwhile a secondary team of DWMA students actually get to shine instead of Maka and co, which is always welcome in battle series with huge casts. The big, important fight is of course being saved for our main crew, but it's still nice that Kirikou and his team can show off their stuff for a bit.    Outside of the action, the forces of darkness are still active in other ways. Ashura's awakening is causing a stirring of madness among the general populous, and especially in Dr. Stein, who's slowly being consumed by his inner darkness. But the real kicker is when Medusa slithers back into Crona's life just as they're starting to make friends at DWMA, and convinces her abused child to betray them and become her spy inside the school. After the progress we saw Crona make after their fight with Maka, it's genuinely heartbreaking to see this backslide, retreating into the madness and fear that once defined their entire personhood. It's by far the most affecting character arc right now by miles, easily eclipsing the rather pat teamwork lessons Maka and Black Star deal with during a training chapter here.    Unfortunately there is one big, obnoxious zit on volume six's face, and its name is Excalibur. For reasons I can't comprehend, the story interrupts itself for a full-length comedy chapter about Hero, a total gag character, teaming up with Excalibur to take over the school and get revenge on everyone who looks down on him. As somebody who also loves committing to overlong comedic bits for the sole purpose of annoying the reader, I can at least appreciate the idea behind Excalibur, but that doesn't make his dialogue any less of a chore to sit through. Add in some much un-needed skirt flipping and boob groping jokes and you have a chapter comprising all the worst elements of Soul Eater here, breaking up the rising tension of its story and character arcs. Maybe this would have worked better in the original collected volumes, but with The Perfect Edition's expanded chapter count per-book, it absolutely kills the tension while reading the volume on its own.    Other than that blemish, these volumes represent a solid, if somewhat inconsistent, new arc for Soul Eater's overarching story. The biggest complaint – besides Excalibur – is that the expanding scope of the story leaves Maka and Soul feeling underutilized and out of focus. That's perhaps to be expected as a series with such a huge cast goes on, but after their partnership defined so much of the conflict before this, it feels like the series doesn't quite know what to do with them besides occasionally hinting at the return of the black blood demon. But on its own, this is an effective, often thrilling chunk of storytelling and offers some fantastic highlights.

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 27th 2022       Soul Eater - The Perfect Edition GN 4-6                      Synopsis:             Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.      Review:         Synopsis:        Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.     Review:            Volume four of The Perfect Edition sees Soul Eater in pure, shonen action mode. It's the classic setup of an evil villain waiting at the end of a gauntlet of enemies, with each of our major characters getting a battle against an established baddie as they duke it out for the fate of the world. The main event is the rematch between Maka, Soul, and the Ragnarok duo, and it's some Grade A shonen fighting goodness. While the various beats it hits are pretty standard, they're delivered with the series' signature style and Ohkubo's exaggerated choreography, and thus land with a ton of impact, especially once “mad” Maka takes over and delivers some of the goofiest creepy-cute faces ever put to page.    Though the fight itself ends on a bit of a let down. Much is made about Maka resonating with Soul and giving into the black blood, but that ends up not mattering much as the fight resolves in a classic power of friendship conclusion. Don't get me wrong: Crona's backstory is emotionally affecting, and Maka reaching out to them with unconditional compassion is probably the best character moment in the series so far. But it doesn't quite match the tension and personal stakes that led up to it, and it leaves the whole black blood storyline feeling anticlimactic when it should be a huge turning point.    But the star of the show here is the Kishin himself, as the rest of the cast predictably fail to prevent his awakening. The sequence of Free and Eruka approaching his resting place is the most palpable horror in the manga so far, and it's followed up by a gloriously gross sequence of body horror as the Kishin literally puts himself back together skin-first. In classic Big Bad fashion he crushes our heroes with barely a whisper, and the only downside is that his fight with Lord Death has to be cut short so we can set up for the next arc. Again, that's predictable for this kind of shonen story, but it's still a tiny bit deflating to close things out with the new, dangerous villain running away. This is also supposed to be a sample of what Lord Death is capable of himself, and it winds up a pretty underwhelming showing for the guy.    Fittingly, Volume 5 is all about establishing the new conflict, introducing new characters on both sides as Ashura's awakening stirs up the rest of the world. On the good guys side, we're introduced to three of Lord Death's other Death Scythe weapons, each with their own quirks and powers. And like much of Ohkubo's extended cast, they're a mixed bag to start, as we initially learn about them through their singular comedic gimmicks. Marie Mjolnir has a great design and likable personality, but she's also obsessed with finding a husband, and that joke gets old fast. Similarly, Justin Law is a great fighter and has an interesting backstory as a solo Demon Weapon who became a Death Scythe at just 13, but his joke about always having his earbuds in wears out its welcome in record time. Azusa Yumi has probably the coolest powers of any Weapon outside Tsubaki, but is defined as the by-the-books straightwoman of the group and doesn't get much to do initially. They're not terrible, but by the end of the volume I was really wishing to see them get serious and stop goofing around. This formula works well with the kids because we already know their personalities beyond the tired gimmicks, but it's a chore to get through with a ton of new people.    The real treats come with the new villains introduced. Ashura himself is still off in the distance, but his resurrection spurs the revival of Arachne, a powerful spider-themed witch who immediately steals any page she's on. Her subordinate weapon, Giriko, leaves a little to be desired, as he initially just feels like a meaner version of Free. But his chainsaw powers make for some wild fights that more than made up for his retread personality. Their diminutive old butler(?) Mr. Mosquito has a striking, cartoony design that makes him stand out among Ohkubo's other villains, and his condescending attitude towards Giriko breathes a lot of life to this new primary villain group. Add in Medusa returning – by possessing the body of an innocent little girl, no less – and we have a great new villain group even before the return of Mifune, who's been forced to fight on their side under threat to Angela's life.    The following volume is more scattered, as we now need to introduce a common goal for the sides to scrap over while Ashura remains a looming hypothetical threat. This comes in the form of a search for the Demon Tools, designed centuries ago by a mysterious sorcerer named Eibon and scattered across the world. Volume 6 is bookended with two different quests for these tools, and makes for some of the best action in the series so far.    Kid's skateboard race against an enchanted train across the desert is a real highlight. It's a fast-paced and unique action setpiece, coupled with a three-way fight between Kid and both Arachne and Medusa's cronies that works as great spectacle and a nice highlight for the main kid who had the least to do in the previous arc. The closing battle in a snowy maelstrom doesn't get a conclusion in this volume, but it's got a lot of great, classic shonen moments for some of the side cast. Sid and his partner Mira, along with Death Scythe Azusa, have a fantastic and tactical fight against Mifune that shows off Ohkubo's improved eye for melee combat, packed with lots of inventive twists involving both the snowy landscape and Sid's zombie body. Meanwhile a secondary team of DWMA students actually get to shine instead of Maka and co, which is always welcome in battle series with huge casts. The big, important fight is of course being saved for our main crew, but it's still nice that Kirikou and his team can show off their stuff for a bit.    Outside of the action, the forces of darkness are still active in other ways. Ashura's awakening is causing a stirring of madness among the general populous, and especially in Dr. Stein, who's slowly being consumed by his inner darkness. But the real kicker is when Medusa slithers back into Crona's life just as they're starting to make friends at DWMA, and convinces her abused child to betray them and become her spy inside the school. After the progress we saw Crona make after their fight with Maka, it's genuinely heartbreaking to see this backslide, retreating into the madness and fear that once defined their entire personhood. It's by far the most affecting character arc right now by miles, easily eclipsing the rather pat teamwork lessons Maka and Black Star deal with during a training chapter here.    Unfortunately there is one big, obnoxious zit on volume six's face, and its name is Excalibur. For reasons I can't comprehend, the story interrupts itself for a full-length comedy chapter about Hero, a total gag character, teaming up with Excalibur to take over the school and get revenge on everyone who looks down on him. As somebody who also loves committing to overlong comedic bits for the sole purpose of annoying the reader, I can at least appreciate the idea behind Excalibur, but that doesn't make his dialogue any less of a chore to sit through. Add in some much un-needed skirt flipping and boob groping jokes and you have a chapter comprising all the worst elements of Soul Eater here, breaking up the rising tension of its story and character arcs. Maybe this would have worked better in the original collected volumes, but with The Perfect Edition's expanded chapter count per-book, it absolutely kills the tension while reading the volume on its own.    Other than that blemish, these volumes represent a solid, if somewhat inconsistent, new arc for Soul Eater's overarching story. The biggest complaint – besides Excalibur – is that the expanding scope of the story leaves Maka and Soul feeling underutilized and out of focus. That's perhaps to be expected as a series with such a huge cast goes on, but after their partnership defined so much of the conflict before this, it feels like the series doesn't quite know what to do with them besides occasionally hinting at the return of the black blood demon. But on its own, this is an effective, often thrilling chunk of storytelling and offers some fantastic highlights.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Story : B+ Art : A  + Entertaining new villains, fantastic action highlights, Crona's arc is the most compelling drama in the series so far − Some anticlimactic finishes, new heroes take some time to warm up to, Excalibur is here            discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Atsushi Ohkubo   Full encyclopedia details aboutSoul Eater (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

America in Summer   posted on 2022-04-08 00:30 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo          loundraw's directorial debut screens subbed/dubbed    GKIDS announced on Thursday that it has acquired the North American distribution rights to the ""Summer Ghost"" anime short, the directorial debut of illustrator loundraw (I Want to Eat Your Pancreas, Josee, The Tiger and the Fish, Vivy -Fluorite Eye's Song-). The company will release the anime in Japanese with English subtitles and with a new English dub in theaters this summer. The anime will screen along with a documentary about the production of the film and additional special content. GKIDS streamed an English-subtitled trailer:      The short opened in Japan on November 12.    Chiaki Kobayashi stars as the main character Tomoya Sugisaki, a third-year student with good grades. However, he is reluctant to take the college entrance exams because he rather be drawing art.       The other cast members include:    Miyuri Shimabukuro as Aoi Harukawa, a second-year student who is dealing with bullying in the high school's clique system   Nobunaga Shimazaki as Ryō Kobayashi, a third-year student who is a popular member of the basketball team, but is now facing an illness he hasn't told even his friends about    Rina Kawaei as Ayane Satō, the ""summer ghost""      The story of the short developed from a single illustration that loundraw had drawn. Tomoya, Aoi, and Ryō are high school students who met online. An urban legend speaks of a ""summer ghost,"" a spirit girl who appears when fireworks are set off.    Tomoya cannot live the life he envisioned for himself.  Aoi cannot find her place in the world. Ryō has his once shining future suddenly pulled away. Each has their own reason for needing to meet the summer ghost. On a summer night when life and death cross paths, where will each of their emotions take them?    In addition to directing, loundraw also drafted the original character designs, and Flat Studio, the studio loundraw established in 2019, is animating. Hirotaka Adachi, better known as the novelist Otsuichi (Stare film, Goth, Calling You, Zoo), wrote the screenplay. Flagship Line is planning and producing the project, and Avex Pictures is distributing. In addition to internationally renowned pianist Akira Kosemura, Itoko Toma, Guiano, and Hideya Kojima are contributing to the soundtrack.    Yoshi Inomi launched the manga adaptation in the Tonari no Young Jump service on October 8, and its compiled book volume shipped on November 19.  The anime's scriptwriter (and acclaimed novelist) Otsuichi wrote a novelization that expands the story, and it shipped on October 29. In addition, the spinoff original novel Ichinose Yūna ga Uiteiru (Yūna Ichinose Is Floating), which picks up the motif of ""fireworks and ghosts,""  shipped on November 26.    The short is part of Project Common, a multimedia initiative ""to express the true loundraw."" The illustrator said last summer, ""Unchanging at any time, I want to find my steadfast self. This project is a challenge to find the true 'loundraw' with myself and everyone."" The project's website included the English text ""real or fake? The way he thinks, the way he draws. These all become 'one.'""    loundraw drew the original character designs for the Tsuki ga Kirei television anime series, and also provided the original character designs and cover illustration for Yoru Sumino's I Want to Eat Your Pancreas novel. The novel has inspired an anime film using his original character designs. He also drew the character designs for an animated promotional video based on Yusuke Yamada's Boku wa Robot Goshi no Kimi ni Koi wo Suru (I fall in love with you through a robot) novel. The novel is also getting a full animated film adaptation.

America in Summer   posted on 2022-04-08 00:30 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo          loundraw's directorial debut screens subbed/dubbed    GKIDS announced on Thursday that it has acquired the North American distribution rights to the ""Summer Ghost"" anime short, the directorial debut of illustrator loundraw (I Want to Eat Your Pancreas, Josee, The Tiger and the Fish, Vivy -Fluorite Eye's Song-). The company will release the anime in Japanese with English subtitles and with a new English dub in theaters this summer. The anime will screen along with a documentary about the production of the film and additional special content. GKIDS streamed an English-subtitled trailer:      The short opened in Japan on November 12.    Chiaki Kobayashi stars as the main character Tomoya Sugisaki, a third-year student with good grades. However, he is reluctant to take the college entrance exams because he rather be drawing art.       The other cast members include:    Miyuri Shimabukuro as Aoi Harukawa, a second-year student who is dealing with bullying in the high school's clique system   Nobunaga Shimazaki as Ryō Kobayashi, a third-year student who is a popular member of the basketball team, but is now facing an illness he hasn't told even his friends about    Rina Kawaei as Ayane Satō, the ""summer ghost""      The story of the short developed from a single illustration that loundraw had drawn. Tomoya, Aoi, and Ryō are high school students who met online. An urban legend speaks of a ""summer ghost,"" a spirit girl who appears when fireworks are set off.    Tomoya cannot live the life he envisioned for himself.  Aoi cannot find her place in the world. Ryō has his once shining future suddenly pulled away. Each has their own reason for needing to meet the summer ghost. On a summer night when life and death cross paths, where will each of their emotions take them?    In addition to directing, loundraw also drafted the original character designs, and Flat Studio, the studio loundraw established in 2019, is animating. Hirotaka Adachi, better known as the novelist Otsuichi (Stare film, Goth, Calling You, Zoo), wrote the screenplay. Flagship Line is planning and producing the project, and Avex Pictures is distributing. In addition to internationally renowned pianist Akira Kosemura, Itoko Toma, Guiano, and Hideya Kojima are contributing to the soundtrack.    Yoshi Inomi launched the manga adaptation in the Tonari no Young Jump service on October 8, and its compiled book volume shipped on November 19.  The anime's scriptwriter (and acclaimed novelist) Otsuichi wrote a novelization that expands the story, and it shipped on October 29. In addition, the spinoff original novel Ichinose Yūna ga Uiteiru (Yūna Ichinose Is Floating), which picks up the motif of ""fireworks and ghosts,""  shipped on November 26.    The short is part of Project Common, a multimedia initiative ""to express the true loundraw."" The illustrator said last summer, ""Unchanging at any time, I want to find my steadfast self. This project is a challenge to find the true 'loundraw' with myself and everyone."" The project's website included the English text ""real or fake? The way he thinks, the way he draws. These all become 'one.'""    loundraw drew the original character designs for the Tsuki ga Kirei television anime series, and also provided the original character designs and cover illustration for Yoru Sumino's I Want to Eat Your Pancreas novel. The novel has inspired an anime film using his original character designs. He also drew the character designs for an animated promotional video based on Yusuke Yamada's Boku wa Robot Goshi no Kimi ni Koi wo Suru (I fall in love with you through a robot) novel. The novel is also getting a full animated film adaptation.

Interest Quintessential Quintuplets Voice Actors Compete For Cash at AnimeJapan Stage Event   posted on 2022-04-06 03:45 UTC-8 by Ken Iikura-Gross           AnimeJapan 2022 hosted a fun talk show featuring The Quintessential Quintuplets voice actors Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Fuutaro Uesugi), Ayana Taketatsu (Nino Nakano), and Ayane Sakura (Yotsuba Nakano) ahead of the film's opening in May. But this was no ordinary talk show. The three were competing for a 10,000 yen (approximately 81.15 USD) gift certificate for Bic Camera, one of Japan's largest electronic stores.    The premise of the game was quite simple: Matsuoka, Taketatsu, and Sakura would have to answer three questions. The twist was Taketatsu and Sakura would only get points if their answer matched Matsuoka's. This meant Matsuoka could mess around with his answers if he wanted to hog the prize. There was, of course, a bit of time before the voice actors had to write their answers down, which meant Taketatsu and Sakura could grill Matsuoka to figure out his answer. On top of this, Taketatsu and Sakura impressed upon Matsuoka that they were at AnimeJapan to promote the upcoming movie, so he should answer truthfully—to whatever extent Matsuoka thought was the truth.     The games began with the simple question “What's on May 20?” Both Taketatsu and Sakura made sure Matsuoka knew the date and how important it was. Unrelenting, Matsuoka ensured the two women he knew what was on May 20. When the answers were revealed, each voice actor had the same answer: the movie's release day. However, Matsuoka threw in a little twist by changing up the kanji used for the word “release day,” kōkaibi (公開日), to the phrase “regretful day,” kōkaibi (後悔日). A fun little word play by Matsuoka, but clearly not the same answer as Taketatsu or Sakura—though they tried to argue in the spirit of the words being phonetically the same. Alas, Taketatsu and Sakura's plea's fell on deaf ears and Matsuoka was awarded the point.    The second question became a little personal for Matsuoka with the question, “What kind of dish would you want someone you're interested in to make?” Matsuoka insisted that the two women probably wouldn't want to know the answer, but Sakura was gunning for the prize. Thus, she showed great interest in Matsuoka's answer. Or so the audience was lead to believe as it was actually Taketatsu who lead the questioning so far as to ask if the dish was curry or hayashi rice. This clearly put Matsuoka in a tough spot as it looked as if he wanted to answer truthfully, but then again, prize. In the end, though, Matsuoka relented and when the answers were revealed, Taketatsu and Sakura's answers both matched Matsuoka's hayashi rice.    With the score tied up 1-1-1, the final question was the tiebreaker. Another personal question for Matsuoka: “What kind of date spot would you go to?” He mentioned it was somewhat outdoors, but not really a place where you can feel the change of seasons. A difficult hint for Taketatsu and Sakura, the two woman bent the rules a bit and asked a few more questions after their time had run out. All for the prize. And again, the three had the same answer: aquarium. Thus, giving the actresses the victory. Or so everyone thought until Sakura asked to see Taketatsu's answer once again. Upon further review it turned out Taketatsu had missed one stroke in the kanji kan (館) giving Sakura a distinct advantage over Taketatsu. Still, in the spirit of sportsmanship, they both had the same answer as Matsuoka. So, the tiebreaker went to the audience, with the clear and decisive winner being Sakura for the correct writing of the kanji.     This was a fun little game for the audience at AnimeJapan 2022 and those watching at home. We got to learn a bit about Matsuoka and the competitive, but in good fun, nature of Taketatsu and Sakura. It was also a good look into the harem race in The Quintessential Quintuplets, to be concluded in May. May the best girl win.        discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Interest Quintessential Quintuplets Voice Actors Compete For Cash at AnimeJapan Stage Event   posted on 2022-04-06 03:45 UTC-8 by Ken Iikura-Gross           AnimeJapan 2022 hosted a fun talk show featuring The Quintessential Quintuplets voice actors Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Fuutaro Uesugi), Ayana Taketatsu (Nino Nakano), and Ayane Sakura (Yotsuba Nakano) ahead of the film's opening in May. But this was no ordinary talk show. The three were competing for a 10,000 yen (approximately 81.15 USD) gift certificate for Bic Camera, one of Japan's largest electronic stores.    The premise of the game was quite simple: Matsuoka, Taketatsu, and Sakura would have to answer three questions. The twist was Taketatsu and Sakura would only get points if their answer matched Matsuoka's. This meant Matsuoka could mess around with his answers if he wanted to hog the prize. There was, of course, a bit of time before the voice actors had to write their answers down, which meant Taketatsu and Sakura could grill Matsuoka to figure out his answer. On top of this, Taketatsu and Sakura impressed upon Matsuoka that they were at AnimeJapan to promote the upcoming movie, so he should answer truthfully—to whatever extent Matsuoka thought was the truth.     The games began with the simple question “What's on May 20?” Both Taketatsu and Sakura made sure Matsuoka knew the date and how important it was. Unrelenting, Matsuoka ensured the two women he knew what was on May 20. When the answers were revealed, each voice actor had the same answer: the movie's release day. However, Matsuoka threw in a little twist by changing up the kanji used for the word “release day,” kōkaibi (公開日), to the phrase “regretful day,” kōkaibi (後悔日). A fun little word play by Matsuoka, but clearly not the same answer as Taketatsu or Sakura—though they tried to argue in the spirit of the words being phonetically the same. Alas, Taketatsu and Sakura's plea's fell on deaf ears and Matsuoka was awarded the point.    The second question became a little personal for Matsuoka with the question, “What kind of dish would you want someone you're interested in to make?” Matsuoka insisted that the two women probably wouldn't want to know the answer, but Sakura was gunning for the prize. Thus, she showed great interest in Matsuoka's answer. Or so the audience was lead to believe as it was actually Taketatsu who lead the questioning so far as to ask if the dish was curry or hayashi rice. This clearly put Matsuoka in a tough spot as it looked as if he wanted to answer truthfully, but then again, prize. In the end, though, Matsuoka relented and when the answers were revealed, Taketatsu and Sakura's answers both matched Matsuoka's hayashi rice.    With the score tied up 1-1-1, the final question was the tiebreaker. Another personal question for Matsuoka: “What kind of date spot would you go to?” He mentioned it was somewhat outdoors, but not really a place where you can feel the change of seasons. A difficult hint for Taketatsu and Sakura, the two woman bent the rules a bit and asked a few more questions after their time had run out. All for the prize. And again, the three had the same answer: aquarium. Thus, giving the actresses the victory. Or so everyone thought until Sakura asked to see Taketatsu's answer once again. Upon further review it turned out Taketatsu had missed one stroke in the kanji kan (館) giving Sakura a distinct advantage over Taketatsu. Still, in the spirit of sportsmanship, they both had the same answer as Matsuoka. So, the tiebreaker went to the audience, with the clear and decisive winner being Sakura for the correct writing of the kanji.     This was a fun little game for the audience at AnimeJapan 2022 and those watching at home. We got to learn a bit about Matsuoka and the competitive, but in good fun, nature of Taketatsu and Sakura. It was also a good look into the harem race in The Quintessential Quintuplets, to be concluded in May. May the best girl win.        discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Interest Quintessential Quintuplets Voice Actors Compete For Cash at AnimeJapan Stage Event   posted on 2022-04-06 03:45 UTC-8 by Ken Iikura-Gross           AnimeJapan 2022 hosted a fun talk show featuring The Quintessential Quintuplets voice actors Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Fuutaro Uesugi), Ayana Taketatsu (Nino Nakano), and Ayane Sakura (Yotsuba Nakano) ahead of the film's opening in May. But this was no ordinary talk show. The three were competing for a 10,000 yen (approximately 81.15 USD) gift certificate for Bic Camera, one of Japan's largest electronic stores.    The premise of the game was quite simple: Matsuoka, Taketatsu, and Sakura would have to answer three questions. The twist was Taketatsu and Sakura would only get points if their answer matched Matsuoka's. This meant Matsuoka could mess around with his answers if he wanted to hog the prize. There was, of course, a bit of time before the voice actors had to write their answers down, which meant Taketatsu and Sakura could grill Matsuoka to figure out his answer. On top of this, Taketatsu and Sakura impressed upon Matsuoka that they were at AnimeJapan to promote the upcoming movie, so he should answer truthfully—to whatever extent Matsuoka thought was the truth.     The games began with the simple question “What's on May 20?” Both Taketatsu and Sakura made sure Matsuoka knew the date and how important it was. Unrelenting, Matsuoka ensured the two women he knew what was on May 20. When the answers were revealed, each voice actor had the same answer: the movie's release day. However, Matsuoka threw in a little twist by changing up the kanji used for the word “release day,” kōkaibi (公開日), to the phrase “regretful day,” kōkaibi (後悔日). A fun little word play by Matsuoka, but clearly not the same answer as Taketatsu or Sakura—though they tried to argue in the spirit of the words being phonetically the same. Alas, Taketatsu and Sakura's plea's fell on deaf ears and Matsuoka was awarded the point.    The second question became a little personal for Matsuoka with the question, “What kind of dish would you want someone you're interested in to make?” Matsuoka insisted that the two women probably wouldn't want to know the answer, but Sakura was gunning for the prize. Thus, she showed great interest in Matsuoka's answer. Or so the audience was lead to believe as it was actually Taketatsu who lead the questioning so far as to ask if the dish was curry or hayashi rice. This clearly put Matsuoka in a tough spot as it looked as if he wanted to answer truthfully, but then again, prize. In the end, though, Matsuoka relented and when the answers were revealed, Taketatsu and Sakura's answers both matched Matsuoka's hayashi rice.    With the score tied up 1-1-1, the final question was the tiebreaker. Another personal question for Matsuoka: “What kind of date spot would you go to?” He mentioned it was somewhat outdoors, but not really a place where you can feel the change of seasons. A difficult hint for Taketatsu and Sakura, the two woman bent the rules a bit and asked a few more questions after their time had run out. All for the prize. And again, the three had the same answer: aquarium. Thus, giving the actresses the victory. Or so everyone thought until Sakura asked to see Taketatsu's answer once again. Upon further review it turned out Taketatsu had missed one stroke in the kanji kan (館) giving Sakura a distinct advantage over Taketatsu. Still, in the spirit of sportsmanship, they both had the same answer as Matsuoka. So, the tiebreaker went to the audience, with the clear and decisive winner being Sakura for the correct writing of the kanji.     This was a fun little game for the audience at AnimeJapan 2022 and those watching at home. We got to learn a bit about Matsuoka and the competitive, but in good fun, nature of Taketatsu and Sakura. It was also a good look into the harem race in The Quintessential Quintuplets, to be concluded in May.

Sasaki and Miyano Episode 12  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Sasaki and Miyano ?                     Community score: 4.7            Honestly, y'all are lucky to be getting an actual review here. A sizable portion of my brain was tempted to forego writing anything coherent and just post confetti gifs and this video before calling it a day. But editorial probably wouldn't be cool with that, so now I'm left to figure out how to package this bundle of squees and d'awws into something resembling a formal review.    Because really, this entire episode is a singleminded lead-up to the confession scene we've been waiting weeks to see. Like sure, there are some nice moments in the build-up. It's nice to get Hanzawa giving a concerned warning about the possible microaggressions that come with being a gay couple in a heteronormative society, and it's funny watching Hirano playing intermediary because these two idiots still haven't exchanged cell phone numbers. There's an especially nice moment showing Sasaki's internalized his lesson about boundaries from the previous arc, and he gives a direct apology about it later. Considering this particular moment was a misunderstanding I was worried the show would brush it off with Miyano insisting it wasn't a big deal, but they offer a lot more nuance to it, and emphasize that the key is for both our boys to honestly, earnestly communicate with one another.    And boy do they communicate once Miyano catches up with Sasaki. Like several unbroken minutes of him gushing out every feeling he's ever had about the guy, finally saying all the things left frustratingly unsaid across the show. It's a seriously charming moment that's only eclipsed by the ridiculously tender kiss scene that follows. It's already rare for romance anime to actually get to the kissing portion of their central relationship, but even when they do it's almost never with this level of intimacy in its staging and character animation. Just the way they animate the characters' fingers overlapping, interlocking, and separating communicates so much of their emotions without a word.    And that's basically all she wrote for SasaMiya. After three months of slow burn build up we climax (no, not like that) with a beautiful kiss, a little bit of humor as falling action, and then wave goodbye with the promise of some new anime project in the future. It's about as fitting a conclusion as you can ask for from this kind of show, but it's also not a ton to analyze. It's just really, really nice to see these two finally get together and share such a wonderful moment.    That's also more or less where I stand with SasaMiya. It's infectiously cute, mellow, and altogether pleasant. It's brought to life through some impeccable direction and a laser-focus on delivering low-stakes humor and romance. If you're looking for something to watch that goes down like warm porridge, this about as close to that ideal as you can get. And as a side-note, if you're in the mood for more and are up for a girls-centric story, maybe check out the Kase-san and... Cherry Blossoms OVA. So long as you've got patience, you're sure to be rewarded by both.     Rating:     Sasaki and Miyano is currently streaming on Funimation.   <prevEpisodes 1-2 Episode 3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episode 6 Episode 7 Episode 8 Episode 9 Episode 10 Episode 11 Episode 12     discuss this in the forum (58 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to Sasaki and Miyano Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Sasaki and Miyano Episode 12  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Sasaki and Miyano ?                     Community score: 4.7            Honestly, y'all are lucky to be getting an actual review here. A sizable portion of my brain was tempted to forego writing anything coherent and just post confetti gifs and this video before calling it a day. But editorial probably wouldn't be cool with that, so now I'm left to figure out how to package this bundle of squees and d'awws into something resembling a formal review.    Because really, this entire episode is a singleminded lead-up to the confession scene we've been waiting weeks to see. Like sure, there are some nice moments in the build-up. It's nice to get Hanzawa giving a concerned warning about the possible microaggressions that come with being a gay couple in a heteronormative society, and it's funny watching Hirano playing intermediary because these two idiots still haven't exchanged cell phone numbers. There's an especially nice moment showing Sasaki's internalized his lesson about boundaries from the previous arc, and he gives a direct apology about it later. Considering this particular moment was a misunderstanding I was worried the show would brush it off with Miyano insisting it wasn't a big deal, but they offer a lot more nuance to it, and emphasize that the key is for both our boys to honestly, earnestly communicate with one another.    And boy do they communicate once Miyano catches up with Sasaki. Like several unbroken minutes of him gushing out every feeling he's ever had about the guy, finally saying all the things left frustratingly unsaid across the show. It's a seriously charming moment that's only eclipsed by the ridiculously tender kiss scene that follows. It's already rare for romance anime to actually get to the kissing portion of their central relationship, but even when they do it's almost never with this level of intimacy in its staging and character animation. Just the way they animate the characters' fingers overlapping, interlocking, and separating communicates so much of their emotions without a word.    And that's basically all she wrote for SasaMiya. After three months of slow burn build up we climax (no, not like that) with a beautiful kiss, a little bit of humor as falling action, and then wave goodbye with the promise of some new anime project in the future. It's about as fitting a conclusion as you can ask for from this kind of show, but it's also not a ton to analyze. It's just really, really nice to see these two finally get together and share such a wonderful moment.    That's also more or less where I stand with SasaMiya. It's infectiously cute, mellow, and altogether pleasant. It's brought to life through some impeccable direction and a laser-focus on delivering low-stakes humor and romance. If you're looking for something to watch that goes down like warm porridge, this about as close to that ideal as you can get. And as a side-note, if you're in the mood for more and are up for a girls-centric story, maybe check out the Kase-san and... Cherry Blossoms OVA. So long as you've got patience, you're sure to be rewarded by both.     Rating:     Sasaki and Miyano is currently streaming on Funimation.   <prevEpisodes 1-2 Episode 3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episode 6 Episode 7 Episode 8 Episode 9 Episode 10 Episode 11 Episode 12     discuss this in the forum (58 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to Sasaki and Miyano Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

But editorial probably wouldn't be cool with that, so now I'm left to figure out how to package this bundle of squees and d'awws into something resembling a formal review.    Because really, this entire episode is a singleminded lead-up to the confession scene we've been waiting weeks to see. Like sure, there are some nice moments in the build-up. It's nice to get Hanzawa giving a concerned warning about the possible microaggressions that come with being a gay couple in a heteronormative society, and it's funny watching Hirano playing intermediary because these two idiots still haven't exchanged cell phone numbers. There's an especially nice moment showing Sasaki's internalized his lesson about boundaries from the previous arc, and he gives a direct apology about it later. Considering this particular moment was a misunderstanding I was worried the show would brush it off with Miyano insisting it wasn't a big deal, but they offer a lot more nuance to it, and emphasize that the key is for both our boys to honestly, earnestly communicate with one another.    And boy do they communicate once Miyano catches up with Sasaki. Like several unbroken minutes of him gushing out every feeling he's ever had about the guy, finally saying all the things left frustratingly unsaid across the show. It's a seriously charming moment that's only eclipsed by the ridiculously tender kiss scene that follows. It's already rare for romance anime to actually get to the kissing portion of their central relationship, but even when they do it's almost never with this level of intimacy in its staging and character animation. Just the way they animate the characters' fingers overlapping, interlocking, and separating communicates so much of their emotions without a word.    And that's basically all she wrote for SasaMiya. After three months of slow burn build up we climax (no, not like that) with a beautiful kiss, a little bit of humor as falling action, and then wave goodbye with the promise of some new anime project in the future. It's about as fitting a conclusion as you can ask for from this kind of show, but it's also not a ton to analyze. It's just really, really nice to see these two finally get together and share such a wonderful moment.    That's also more or less where I stand with SasaMiya. It's infectiously cute, mellow, and altogether pleasant. It's brought to life through some impeccable direction and a laser-focus on delivering low-stakes humor and romance. If you're looking for something to watch that goes down like warm porridge, this about as close to that ideal as you can get. And as a side-note, if you're in the mood for more and are up for a girls-centric story, maybe check out the Kase-san and... Cherry Blossoms OVA. So long as you've got patience, you're sure to be rewarded by both.

But editorial probably wouldn't be cool with that, so now I'm left to figure out how to package this bundle of squees and d'awws into something resembling a formal review.    Because really, this entire episode is a singleminded lead-up to the confession scene we've been waiting weeks to see. Like sure, there are some nice moments in the build-up. It's nice to get Hanzawa giving a concerned warning about the possible microaggressions that come with being a gay couple in a heteronormative society, and it's funny watching Hirano playing intermediary because these two idiots still haven't exchanged cell phone numbers. There's an especially nice moment showing Sasaki's internalized his lesson about boundaries from the previous arc, and he gives a direct apology about it later. Considering this particular moment was a misunderstanding I was worried the show would brush it off with Miyano insisting it wasn't a big deal, but they offer a lot more nuance to it, and emphasize that the key is for both our boys to honestly, earnestly communicate with one another.    And boy do they communicate once Miyano catches up with Sasaki. Like several unbroken minutes of him gushing out every feeling he's ever had about the guy, finally saying all the things left frustratingly unsaid across the show. It's a seriously charming moment that's only eclipsed by the ridiculously tender kiss scene that follows. It's already rare for romance anime to actually get to the kissing portion of their central relationship, but even when they do it's almost never with this level of intimacy in its staging and character animation. Just the way they animate the characters' fingers overlapping, interlocking, and separating communicates so much of their emotions without a word.    And that's basically all she wrote for SasaMiya. After three months of slow burn build up we climax (no, not like that) with a beautiful kiss, a little bit of humor as falling action, and then wave goodbye with the promise of some new anime project in the future. It's about as fitting a conclusion as you can ask for from this kind of show, but it's also not a ton to analyze. It's just really, really nice to see these two finally get together and share such a wonderful moment.    That's also more or less where I stand with SasaMiya. It's infectiously cute, mellow, and altogether pleasant. It's brought to life through some impeccable direction and a laser-focus on delivering low-stakes humor and romance. If you're looking for something to watch that goes down like warm porridge, this about as close to that ideal as you can get. And as a side-note, if you're in the mood for more and are up for a girls-centric story, maybe check out the Kase-san and... Cherry Blossoms OVA. So long as you've got patience, you're sure to be rewarded by both.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in.

Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.  ",positive,en,{}

News NHK Report: Toei Animation Hack Was Ransomware Attack   posted on 2022-04-08 20:00 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Ransomware attack continues to affect production of delayed Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero film    NHK reported on Thursday that according to its sources at Toei Animation, the Toei Animation hack last month was a ransomware attack. NHK quoted a company source as saying, ""the impact on production is still continuing, and we are working hard to bring things back to normal.""    Toei Animation added it is still investigating the details of the attack, and stated it is not sure if it can completely restore what was lost in the attack. NHK added the ransomware attack is still affecting the production of the Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero film.    A ransomware attack is a form of malware attack that restricts access to data on a company's internal servers until a ransom is paid. Ransomware attacks disrupted meat production and gasoline distribution in the U.S. in 2021, and also hit Diamond Comic Distributors last year.    Toei Animation announced on March 11 that on March 6, an unauthorized third party accessed the company's network, which resulted in a shutdown of part of the company's systems. Toei Animation is currently investigating the matter. The hack affected the broadcast schedules for the One Piece, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai, Delicious Party Precure, and Digimon Ghost Game anime starting with the episodes slated to air on the weekend of March 12-13. All four shows will resume airing new episodes with the weekend of April 16-17.    Toei delayed Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, the second anime film in the Dragon Ball Super franchise, from its original April 22 opening in Japan. The film currently has no set debut date.

News NHK Report: Toei Animation Hack Was Ransomware Attack   posted on 2022-04-08 20:00 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Ransomware attack continues to affect production of delayed Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero film    NHK reported on Thursday that according to its sources at Toei Animation, the Toei Animation hack last month was a ransomware attack. NHK quoted a company source as saying, ""the impact on production is still continuing, and we are working hard to bring things back to normal.""    Toei Animation added it is still investigating the details of the attack, and stated it is not sure if it can completely restore what was lost in the attack. NHK added the ransomware attack is still affecting the production of the Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero film.    A ransomware attack is a form of malware attack that restricts access to data on a company's internal servers until a ransom is paid. Ransomware attacks disrupted meat production and gasoline distribution in the U.S. in 2021, and also hit Diamond Comic Distributors last year.    Toei Animation announced on March 11 that on March 6, an unauthorized third party accessed the company's network, which resulted in a shutdown of part of the company's systems. Toei Animation is currently investigating the matter. The hack affected the broadcast schedules for the One Piece, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai, Delicious Party Precure, and Digimon Ghost Game anime starting with the episodes slated to air on the weekend of March 12-13. All four shows will resume airing new episodes with the weekend of April 16-17.    Toei delayed Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, the second anime film in the Dragon Ball Super franchise, from its original April 22 opening in Japan. The film currently has no set debut date.
