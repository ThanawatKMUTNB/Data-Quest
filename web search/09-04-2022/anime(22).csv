Like them missing something or not being the first on it is fine it happens all the time (its why I prefer animecorner most of time) but there's a limit to when that stops being fine and it just becomes embarrassing and pointless few weeks fine, year old news...its just a joke.   Its not like the article highlights or adds anything new since more than half is them just coping and pasting the SAG-AFTRA blog post to begin with.

Where did any of us say please lie or pretend it was current ? All we are discussing is why you felt the need to source a year old do not work notice and create a whole article about it when there hasn't been an update or new information seems pointless given the case.   Also your point linking to the current active discussions around pay for English dubs in the US also doesn't make much sense since its just a single sentence slapped on the bottom of the article and Ocean is a Canadian production company...   Like if you want to keep highlighting that discussion around pay then fair play please do, but at least try and use current sources.

Might be worth talking about if the notice is still in effect or anything.    Or at least put the ""last year"" bit in the title, since you know a ton of people will share it without reading the article.

It just seemed a bit odd to me since there wasn't any of the follow-up that I would have expected given that the original press release was a year ago. Normally I would assume that if something like this is being posted its because there is new information released that was not previously announced or well known.    While the information on its own is interesting given the merger, I think it might help in the future if such information was appended by the note that as such there has still not been a dub announced in English so that people don't think that this is in response to a completely non-union team being announced.

I did consider it embarrassing since this is a pretty big deal but it wouldn't have been my departments that wrote it up when it was current and now it's probably considered too old for news. However, I still think it's important enough that it should have been acknowledged at the time so that, and given the current movement going on within the professional dub community, I asked one of our writers to post something. At least now if something does change there's a paper trail for it.

Canada used to dub anime more frequently,but that pretty much phased out after the 2000's(with a few exceptions).  Boy,if,as an answer to the voice-actors from California and Texas asking for a raise,companies start to dub more anime in english in places like Japan(see Resident Evil 1,Castlevania Symphony of The Night,Mega Man 8,mega Man X4,Shenmue 1 and 2,House of The Dead,and etc. as examples),Hong Kong,Singapure(where most of the anime broadcasted on Animax in Asia get dubbed in English) or Miami(see the initial dub of AICO The Incarnation and season 1 of Gintama),it's going to be a disaster...

Like them missing something or not being the first on it is fine it happens all the time (its why I prefer animecorner most of time) but there's a limit to when that stops being fine and it just becomes embarrassing and pointless few weeks fine, year old news...its just a joke.   Its not like the article highlights or adds anything new since more than half is them just coping and pasting the SAG-AFTRA blog post to begin with.

Where did any of us say please lie or pretend it was current ? All we are discussing is why you felt the need to source a year old do not work notice and create a whole article about it when there hasn't been an update or new information seems pointless given the case.   Also your point linking to the current active discussions around pay for English dubs in the US also doesn't make much sense since its just a single sentence slapped on the bottom of the article and Ocean is a Canadian production company...   Like if you want to keep highlighting that discussion around pay then fair play please do, but at least try and use current sources.

Might be worth talking about if the notice is still in effect or anything.    Or at least put the ""last year"" bit in the title, since you know a ton of people will share it without reading the article.

It just seemed a bit odd to me since there wasn't any of the follow-up that I would have expected given that the original press release was a year ago. Normally I would assume that if something like this is being posted its because there is new information released that was not previously announced or well known.    While the information on its own is interesting given the merger, I think it might help in the future if such information was appended by the note that as such there has still not been a dub announced in English so that people don't think that this is in response to a completely non-union team being announced.

I did consider it embarrassing since this is a pretty big deal but it wouldn't have been my departments that wrote it up when it was current and now it's probably considered too old for news. However, I still think it's important enough that it should have been acknowledged at the time so that, and given the current movement going on within the professional dub community, I asked one of our writers to post something. At least now if something does change there's a paper trail for it.

Canada used to dub anime more frequently,but that pretty much phased out after the 2000's(with a few exceptions).  Boy,if,as an answer to the voice-actors from California and Texas asking for a raise,companies start to dub more anime in english in places like Japan(see Resident Evil 1,Castlevania Symphony of The Night,Mega Man 8,mega Man X4,Shenmue 1 and 2,House of The Dead,and etc. as examples),Hong Kong,Singapure(where most of the anime broadcasted on Animax in Asia get dubbed in English) or Miami(see the initial dub of AICO The Incarnation and season 1 of Gintama),it's going to be a disaster...

Like them missing something or not being the first on it is fine it happens all the time (its why I prefer animecorner most of time) but there's a limit to when that stops being fine and it just becomes embarrassing and pointless few weeks fine, year old news...its just a joke.   Its not like the article highlights or adds anything new since more than half is them just coping and pasting the SAG-AFTRA blog post to begin with.

Where did any of us say please lie or pretend it was current ? All we are discussing is why you felt the need to source a year old do not work notice and create a whole article about it when there hasn't been an update or new information seems pointless given the case.   Also your point linking to the current active discussions around pay for English dubs in the US also doesn't make much sense since its just a single sentence slapped on the bottom of the article and Ocean is a Canadian production company...   Like if you want to keep highlighting that discussion around pay then fair play please do, but at least try and use current sources.

Might be worth talking about if the notice is still in effect or anything.    Or at least put the ""last year"" bit in the title, since you know a ton of people will share it without reading the article.

It just seemed a bit odd to me since there wasn't any of the follow-up that I would have expected given that the original press release was a year ago. Normally I would assume that if something like this is being posted its because there is new information released that was not previously announced or well known.    While the information on its own is interesting given the merger, I think it might help in the future if such information was appended by the note that as such there has still not been a dub announced in English so that people don't think that this is in response to a completely non-union team being announced.

I did consider it embarrassing since this is a pretty big deal but it wouldn't have been my departments that wrote it up when it was current and now it's probably considered too old for news. However, I still think it's important enough that it should have been acknowledged at the time so that, and given the current movement going on within the professional dub community, I asked one of our writers to post something. At least now if something does change there's a paper trail for it.

Canada used to dub anime more frequently,but that pretty much phased out after the 2000's(with a few exceptions).  Boy,if,as an answer to the voice-actors from California and Texas asking for a raise,companies start to dub more anime in english in places like Japan(see Resident Evil 1,Castlevania Symphony of The Night,Mega Man 8,mega Man X4,Shenmue 1 and 2,House of The Dead,and etc. as examples),Hong Kong,Singapure(where most of the anime broadcasted on Animax in Asia get dubbed in English) or Miami(see the initial dub of AICO The Incarnation and season 1 of Gintama),it's going to be a disaster...

All we are discussing is why you felt the need to source a year old do not work notice and create a whole article about it when there hasn't been an update or new information seems pointless given the case.   Also your point linking to the current active discussions around pay for English dubs in the US also doesn't make much sense since its just a single sentence slapped on the bottom of the article and Ocean is a Canadian production company...

It just seemed a bit odd to me since there wasn't any of the follow-up that I would have expected given that the original press release was a year ago. Normally I would assume that if something like this is being posted its because there is new information released that was not previously announced or well known.    While the information on its own is interesting given the merger, I think it might help in the future if such information was appended by the note that as such there has still not been a dub announced in English so that people don't think that this is in response to a completely non-union team being announced.

I did consider it embarrassing since this is a pretty big deal but it wouldn't have been my departments that wrote it up when it was current and now it's probably considered too old for news. However, I still think it's important enough that it should have been acknowledged at the time so that, and given the current movement going on within the professional dub community, I asked one of our writers to post something. At least now if something does change there's a paper trail for it.

Canada used to dub anime more frequently,but that pretty much phased out after the 2000's(with a few exceptions).  Boy,if,as an answer to the voice-actors from California and Texas asking for a raise,companies start to dub more anime in english in places like Japan(see Resident Evil 1,Castlevania Symphony of The Night,Mega Man 8,mega Man X4,Shenmue 1 and 2,House of The Dead,and etc. as examples),Hong Kong,Singapure(where most of the anime broadcasted on Animax in Asia get dubbed in English) or Miami(see the initial dub of AICO The Incarnation and season 1 of Gintama),it's going to be a disaster...

Where did any of us say please lie or pretend it was current ? All we are discussing is why you felt the need to source a year old do not work notice and create a whole article about it when there hasn't been an update or new information seems pointless given the case.   Also your point linking to the current active discussions around pay for English dubs in the US also doesn't make much sense since its just a single sentence slapped on the bottom of the article and Ocean is a Canadian production company...

Like them missing something or not being the first on it is fine it happens all the time (its why I prefer animecorner most of time) but there's a limit to when that stops being fine and it just becomes embarrassing and pointless few weeks fine, year old news...its just a joke.

All we are discussing is why you felt the need to source a year old do not work notice and create a whole article about it when there hasn't been an update or new information seems pointless given the case.   Also your point linking to the current active discussions around pay for English dubs in the US also doesn't make much sense since its just a single sentence slapped on the bottom of the article and Ocean is a Canadian production company...

Like them missing something or not being the first on it is fine it happens all the time (its why I prefer animecorner most of time) but there's a limit to when that stops being fine and it just becomes embarrassing and pointless few weeks fine, year old news...its just a joke.   Its not like the article highlights or adds anything new since more than half is them just coping and pasting the SAG-AFTRA blog post to begin with.

Where did any of us say please lie or pretend it was current ? All we are discussing is why you felt the need to source a year old do not work notice and create a whole article about it when there hasn't been an update or new information seems pointless given the case.   Also your point linking to the current active discussions around pay for English dubs in the US also doesn't make much sense since its just a single sentence slapped on the bottom of the article and Ocean is a Canadian production company...   Like if you want to keep highlighting that discussion around pay then fair play please do, but at least try and use current sources.

It just seemed a bit odd to me since there wasn't any of the follow-up that I would have expected given that the original press release was a year ago. Normally I would assume that if something like this is being posted its because there is new information released that was not previously announced or well known.    While the information on its own is interesting given the merger, I think it might help in the future if such information was appended by the note that as such there has still not been a dub announced in English so that people don't think that this is in response to a completely non-union team being announced.

I did consider it embarrassing since this is a pretty big deal but it wouldn't have been my departments that wrote it up when it was current and now it's probably considered too old for news. However, I still think it's important enough that it should have been acknowledged at the time so that, and given the current movement going on within the professional dub community, I asked one of our writers to post something. At least now if something does change there's a paper trail for it.

Go down from the Bebop/Totoro diptych until you hit the rainbow and blue/pink cow-head thing, then look just to the left.   To Spike's right is ""Leaves From the Vine""; go up from the left edge of that and you'll find Rent-A-Girlfriend, then a site that hosts scanlations of Kaguya-sama and Oshi no Ko, then Serial Experiments Lain.   At the very bottom, just above the taskbar, about two-thirds of the way along starting from the left, you can find Yuru Camp just above the sleeping pony. Ultimate Madoka's right near the bottom-right.   EDIT: Ooh, Goodnight Punpun spotted on the right side, like a quarter of the way down. Just to the left of Ness. And there's another 86 reference on the top edge, near the left. I see a tiny Ryuko Matoi near the right, a few hundred pixels above and to the left of a big Kirby. There's Mushoku Tensei under the Kirby, a tiny KyoAni tribute a ways under the gray face to Kirby's right... ooh, some Hololive on the left side, intersecting with Belgium.

Mods/admins abusing power on Reddit, or any community, is nothing new.  I figured bots/scripts were being used to manipulate it anyway which made the whole thing seem pointless anyway.  At least the big streamers using their fanbase to draw stuff were doing it manually and it was a community thing.  It was fun watching Asmongold's community memorialize TotalBiscuit and Miura so some good came out of it at least.

The big surprise is how much space One Piece ended up taking in the end. It was #8 in total pixel size  with it only being beat out by entire countries. Just limiting to media franchises, it was #1.

Go down from the Bebop/Totoro diptych until you hit the rainbow and blue/pink cow-head thing, then look just to the left.   To Spike's right is ""Leaves From the Vine""; go up from the left edge of that and you'll find Rent-A-Girlfriend, then a site that hosts scanlations of Kaguya-sama and Oshi no Ko, then Serial Experiments Lain.   At the very bottom, just above the taskbar, about two-thirds of the way along starting from the left, you can find Yuru Camp just above the sleeping pony. Ultimate Madoka's right near the bottom-right.   EDIT: Ooh, Goodnight Punpun spotted on the right side, like a quarter of the way down. Just to the left of Ness. And there's another 86 reference on the top edge, near the left. I see a tiny Ryuko Matoi near the right, a few hundred pixels above and to the left of a big Kirby. There's Mushoku Tensei under the Kirby, a tiny KyoAni tribute a ways under the gray face to Kirby's right... ooh, some Hololive on the left side, intersecting with Belgium.

Mods/admins abusing power on Reddit, or any community, is nothing new.  I figured bots/scripts were being used to manipulate it anyway which made the whole thing seem pointless anyway.  At least the big streamers using their fanbase to draw stuff were doing it manually and it was a community thing.  It was fun watching Asmongold's community memorialize TotalBiscuit and Miura so some good came out of it at least.

The big surprise is how much space One Piece ended up taking in the end. It was #8 in total pixel size  with it only being beat out by entire countries. Just limiting to media franchises, it was #1.

Go down from the Bebop/Totoro diptych until you hit the rainbow and blue/pink cow-head thing, then look just to the left.   To Spike's right is ""Leaves From the Vine""; go up from the left edge of that and you'll find Rent-A-Girlfriend, then a site that hosts scanlations of Kaguya-sama and Oshi no Ko, then Serial Experiments Lain.   At the very bottom, just above the taskbar, about two-thirds of the way along starting from the left, you can find Yuru Camp just above the sleeping pony. Ultimate Madoka's right near the bottom-right.   EDIT: Ooh, Goodnight Punpun spotted on the right side, like a quarter of the way down. Just to the left of Ness. And there's another 86 reference on the top edge, near the left. I see a tiny Ryuko Matoi near the right, a few hundred pixels above and to the left of a big Kirby. There's Mushoku Tensei under the Kirby, a tiny KyoAni tribute a ways under the gray face to Kirby's right... ooh, some Hololive on the left side, intersecting with Belgium.

Mods/admins abusing power on Reddit, or any community, is nothing new.  I figured bots/scripts were being used to manipulate it anyway which made the whole thing seem pointless anyway.

News AI: The Somnium Files - nirvanA Initiative Sequel Game's Trailer Previews New Gameplay Features   posted on 2022-04-06 22:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Virtual Reality, Truth Reenactment, Wink Psync previewed for June 24 game    Spike Chunsoft began streaming on Tuesday a gameplay trailer for AI: The Somnium Files - nirvanA Initiative, the sequel game to Kōtarō Uchikoshi's AI: The Somnium Files. The video previews the new Virtual Reality, Truth Reenactment, and Wink Psync segments.      The game will get costume and t-shirt DLC that will be available until July 14.    The game will launch for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Windows 10 and Steam in North America and Europe on June 24. The game was originally scheduled for a worldwide spring launch.    The story will feature new characters Ryuki and Tama.    Spike Chunsoft describes the new game:    Six years ago, the right half of a corpse was discovered under mysterious circumstances. The left half was never found...until six years later, when it was discovered completely fresh with no signs of decay, as though the victim was alive until just recently. Now, newly-appointed Special Agent Mizuki and her AI partner Aiba are tasked to solve the bizarre Half Body serial killings...  The game will have both regular and collector's editions, with the latter including an Aiba figure, an art book, and a soundtrack.    AI: The Somnium Files launched for the PS4, Switch, and PC via Steam worldwide in September 2019.

Now, newly-appointed Special Agent Mizuki and her AI partner Aiba are tasked to solve the bizarre Half Body serial killings...  The game will have both regular and collector's editions, with the latter including an Aiba figure, an art book, and a soundtrack.    AI: The Somnium Files launched for the PS4, Switch, and PC via Steam worldwide in September 2019.

The game shipped for Nintendo Switch in Japan on February 25 and in the West on March 23. The game launched for PC via Steam on September 16.    XSEED Games describes the game:   The latest entry in the long-running farming/life simulation franchise, originally known as Bokujo Monogatari in Japan, is a brand-new adventure that drops eager explorers in Olive Town, a charming seaside community on the edge of the untamed frontier, where they will work to breathe life back into their grandfather's dilapidated farm. Though it may at first appear to be a sleepy burg, Olive Town is home to dozens of unique characters to befriend when players are ready to take a break from building their dream farm.  Natsume published most of the previous games in the franchise under the umbrella title of Harvest Moon in North America. However, since XSEED Games — Marvelous AQL's own subsidiary — published the Bokujō Monogatari: Tsunagaru Shin Tenchi game in North America in March 2015, it cannot use Natsume's Harvest Moon title.

News Story of Seasons: Pioneers of Olive Town Game Gets PS4 Version   posted on 2022-04-09 03:30 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         PS4 game launches in Japan on July 28, West this summer    XSeed Games and Marvelous Europe announced on Friday that they will release the Story of Seasons: Pioneers of Olive Town (Bokujō Monogatari Olive Town to Kibō no Daichi) game for PlayStation 4 physically and digitally in the West this summer. The PS4 version will launch in Japan under the name Bokujō Monogatari Olive Town to Kibō no Daichi SPECIAL on July 28.    The game shipped for Nintendo Switch in Japan on February 25 and in the West on March 23. The game launched for PC via Steam on September 16.    XSEED Games describes the game:   The latest entry in the long-running farming/life simulation franchise, originally known as Bokujo Monogatari in Japan, is a brand-new adventure that drops eager explorers in Olive Town, a charming seaside community on the edge of the untamed frontier, where they will work to breathe life back into their grandfather's dilapidated farm. Though it may at first appear to be a sleepy burg, Olive Town is home to dozens of unique characters to befriend when players are ready to take a break from building their dream farm.  Natsume published most of the previous games in the franchise under the umbrella title of Harvest Moon in North America. However, since XSEED Games — Marvelous AQL's own subsidiary — published the Bokujō Monogatari: Tsunagaru Shin Tenchi game in North America in March 2015, it cannot use Natsume's Harvest Moon title.

David Production only has the producing rights for the 6 Parts of the main JoJo continuity, so I don't know where this confidence that Part 7 will be adapted at all is coming from. People suddenly forgot that it took a longer time for DP to anounce the Stone Ocean anime that what it took to anounce the Golden Wind one, yet they keep expecting a new anime season when the previous one hasn't even started, and in Stone Ocean's case, isn't even halfway through adapting the story.   Honestly, people who are already anxious for a Part 7 anime when we just barely got a Part 6 anime (and only the 1st third at that) come off as part skippers to me, so there's that.   On the other hand, way to go of David Production to celebrate 10 years of JoJo by delaying their 5th season/6th Part  almost a full year.

DP is the animation producer, not a part of the production committee aka those who put their money on the table and are the license holders - Warner, Shueisha, Medicos & Klockworx.   These are the ones who have any say in this matter; if Warner wanted to, the series could have changed studio after the first season.   DP can either accept or refuse the offer that the committee proposes to them.   Also, if you're so enlightened, then tell me where did you get the distribution rights thing. And please, don't say Sono Chi No Sadame OP.

David Production only has the producing rights for the 6 Parts of the main JoJo continuity, so I don't know where this confidence that Part 7 will be adapted at all is coming from. People suddenly forgot that it took a longer time for DP to anounce the Stone Ocean anime that what it took to anounce the Golden Wind one, yet they keep expecting a new anime season when the previous one hasn't even started, and in Stone Ocean's case, isn't even halfway through adapting the story.   Honestly, people who are already anxious for a Part 7 anime when we just barely got a Part 6 anime (and only the 1st third at that) come off as part skippers to me, so there's that.   On the other hand, way to go of David Production to celebrate 10 years of JoJo by delaying their 5th season/6th Part  almost a full year.

DP is the animation producer, not a part of the production committee aka those who put their money on the table and are the license holders - Warner, Shueisha, Medicos & Klockworx.   These are the ones who have any say in this matter; if Warner wanted to, the series could have changed studio after the first season.   DP can either accept or refuse the offer that the committee proposes to them.   Also, if you're so enlightened, then tell me where did you get the distribution rights thing. And please, don't say Sono Chi No Sadame OP.

David Production only has the producing rights for the 6 Parts of the main JoJo continuity, so I don't know where this confidence that Part 7 will be adapted at all is coming from. People suddenly forgot that it took a longer time for DP to anounce the Stone Ocean anime that what it took to anounce the Golden Wind one, yet they keep expecting a new anime season when the previous one hasn't even started, and in Stone Ocean's case, isn't even halfway through adapting the story.

DP is the animation producer, not a part of the production committee aka those who put their money on the table and are the license holders - Warner, Shueisha, Medicos & Klockworx.   These are the ones who have any say in this matter; if Warner wanted to, the series could have changed studio after the first season.   DP can either accept or refuse the offer that the committee proposes to them.   Also, if you're so enlightened, then tell me where did you get the distribution rights thing.
