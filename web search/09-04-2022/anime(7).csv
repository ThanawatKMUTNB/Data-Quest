Community score: 2.9              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.

I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet.

Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,{}

Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 2.9              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic.

My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 2.9              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence.

It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.  ",positive,en,{}

News Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Film Earns US$6.25 Million at U.S. Box Office from Preview Screenings   posted on 2022-04-08 23:05 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Film opened on Friday    Entertainment news website Deadline reported on Friday that Paramount Pictures' the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 sequel film earned US$6.25 million at the U.S. box office from Wednesday fan preview screenings and Thursday showtimes.    The sequel film opened in the United States on Friday. The film will open in Japan on August 19.    Idris Elba plays Knuckles in the film, after teasing the role in August prior to the announcement. Colleen O'Shaughnessey reprises her role as Tails. O'Shaughnessey has voiced the character since the 2014 Sonic Boom animated series.    Paramount Pictures studio announced in May 2020 that it was producing a sequel to last year's Sonic the Hedgehog film, with Jeff Fowler returning as director, and Pat Casey and Josh Miller as returning scriptwriters. Neal H. Moritz, Toby Ascher, and Toru Nakahara are credited as producers on the new film, while Hajime Satomi, Haruki Satomi, and Tim Miller are credited as executive producers.    Paramount Pictures announced in February that it has already started development on a third Sonic the Hedgehog film, as well as the first live-action series for the Sonic franchise. The live-action series will debut on Paramount Pictures' Paramount+ streaming service in 2023, and will center on the character Knuckles, with Idris Elba reprising the role.    Paramount Pictures revealed the movie's logo — featuring two tails shaped after the franchise's fox character Tails hanging off of an orange number two — in February 2021. Fowler announced on his Twitter account in March 2021 that production had officially begun on the film on the same day.    The original film earned US$70,002,074 to rank #1 over its Presidents' Day holiday opening weekend in the U.S. in February 2020. The film debuted digitally in March 2020, and shipped on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in May 2020.    The Box Office Mojo website lists the film with a US$148,974,665 United States gross, overtaking Pokémon Detective Pikachu as the #1 film in the United States based on a game. (Detective Pikachu earned US$144,105,346 in the United States.) The film has earned the equivalent of US$170,741,018 internationally, for a US$319,715,683 total worldwide gross.    Ben Schwartz (DuckTales, Parks and Recreation) voiced the title character Sonic in the original film, which opened in the U.S. in February 2020. James Marsden (Westworld, X-Men) and Tika Sumpter starred in the film, and Jim Carrey (The Truman Show, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective) played the villain Robotnik.

News Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Film Earns US$6.25 Million at U.S. Box Office from Preview Screenings   posted on 2022-04-08 23:05 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Film opened on Friday    Entertainment news website Deadline reported on Friday that Paramount Pictures' the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 sequel film earned US$6.25 million at the U.S. box office from Wednesday fan preview screenings and Thursday showtimes.    The sequel film opened in the United States on Friday. The film will open in Japan on August 19.    Idris Elba plays Knuckles in the film, after teasing the role in August prior to the announcement. Colleen O'Shaughnessey reprises her role as Tails. O'Shaughnessey has voiced the character since the 2014 Sonic Boom animated series.    Paramount Pictures studio announced in May 2020 that it was producing a sequel to last year's Sonic the Hedgehog film, with Jeff Fowler returning as director, and Pat Casey and Josh Miller as returning scriptwriters. Neal H. Moritz, Toby Ascher, and Toru Nakahara are credited as producers on the new film, while Hajime Satomi, Haruki Satomi, and Tim Miller are credited as executive producers.    Paramount Pictures announced in February that it has already started development on a third Sonic the Hedgehog film, as well as the first live-action series for the Sonic franchise. The live-action series will debut on Paramount Pictures' Paramount+ streaming service in 2023, and will center on the character Knuckles, with Idris Elba reprising the role.    Paramount Pictures revealed the movie's logo — featuring two tails shaped after the franchise's fox character Tails hanging off of an orange number two — in February 2021. Fowler announced on his Twitter account in March 2021 that production had officially begun on the film on the same day.    The original film earned US$70,002,074 to rank #1 over its Presidents' Day holiday opening weekend in the U.S. in February 2020. The film debuted digitally in March 2020, and shipped on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in May 2020.    The Box Office Mojo website lists the film with a US$148,974,665 United States gross, overtaking Pokémon Detective Pikachu as the #1 film in the United States based on a game. (Detective Pikachu earned US$144,105,346 in the United States.) The film has earned the equivalent of US$170,741,018 internationally, for a US$319,715,683 total worldwide gross.    Ben Schwartz (DuckTales, Parks and Recreation) voiced the title character Sonic in the original film, which opened in the U.S. in February 2020. James Marsden (Westworld, X-Men) and Tika Sumpter starred in the film, and Jim Carrey (The Truman Show, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective) played the villain Robotnik.

News Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Film Earns US$6.25 Million at U.S. Box Office from Preview Screenings   posted on 2022-04-08 23:05 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Film opened on Friday    Entertainment news website Deadline reported on Friday that Paramount Pictures' the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 sequel film earned US$6.25 million at the U.S. box office from Wednesday fan preview screenings and Thursday showtimes.    The sequel film opened in the United States on Friday. The film will open in Japan on August 19.    Idris Elba plays Knuckles in the film, after teasing the role in August prior to the announcement. Colleen O'Shaughnessey reprises her role as Tails. O'Shaughnessey has voiced the character since the 2014 Sonic Boom animated series.    Paramount Pictures studio announced in May 2020 that it was producing a sequel to last year's Sonic the Hedgehog film, with Jeff Fowler returning as director, and Pat Casey and Josh Miller as returning scriptwriters. Neal H. Moritz, Toby Ascher, and Toru Nakahara are credited as producers on the new film, while Hajime Satomi, Haruki Satomi, and Tim Miller are credited as executive producers.    Paramount Pictures announced in February that it has already started development on a third Sonic the Hedgehog film, as well as the first live-action series for the Sonic franchise. The live-action series will debut on Paramount Pictures' Paramount+ streaming service in 2023, and will center on the character Knuckles, with Idris Elba reprising the role.    Paramount Pictures revealed the movie's logo — featuring two tails shaped after the franchise's fox character Tails hanging off of an orange number two — in February 2021. Fowler announced on his Twitter account in March 2021 that production had officially begun on the film on the same day.    The original film earned US$70,002,074 to rank #1 over its Presidents' Day holiday opening weekend in the U.S. in February 2020. The film debuted digitally in March 2020, and shipped on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in May 2020.    The Box Office Mojo website lists the film with a US$148,974,665 United States gross, overtaking Pokémon Detective Pikachu as the #1 film in the United States based on a game. (Detective Pikachu earned US$144,105,346 in the United States.) The film has earned the equivalent of US$170,741,018 internationally, for a US$319,715,683 total worldwide gross.    Ben Schwartz (DuckTales, Parks and Recreation) voiced the title character Sonic in the original film, which opened in the U.S. in February 2020. James Marsden (Westworld, X-Men) and Tika Sumpter starred in the film, and Jim Carrey (The Truman Show, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective) played the villain Robotnik.

Review   by Grant Jones, Mar 29th 2022       Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Voiume 1                     Synopsis:               Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai tells the tale of the young warrior Dai. Dai is raised by monsters on an island and he is friends with a flying golden slime named Gomeachan. One day, this peaceful island is visited by a Hero and his companions – and they have nefarious plans. Soon Dai is being trained by the Hero Avan and befriends the magician Popp while being caught up in the broader struggle against the Demon King Hadlar.    Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Volume 1 is written by Riku Sanjo, illustrated by Koji Inada, and supervised by Yuji Horii. The English translation is by Gregory Werner, the lettering is by Steve Dutro, and editing is by Jennifer Sherman. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is published by Viz Books.

Review:            Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions? Or does the mere mention of its name invoke repetition and endless grind against a trope-laden backdrop that you have plowed through a dozen times before?    I say this because Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is a Dragon Quest manga through and through. It might sound ridiculous because… well, it's right there in the title, but it bears mentioning nonetheless. A video game franchise with a highly-respected legacy that has achieved an almost household-name status in Japan (and growing international fame), it's hard to find someone with zero opinion on the Dragon Quest franchise these days, and Dai actively courts this association with every fiber of its being. So in some sense this is a simple review: would you like more Dragon Quest? If so, proceed onward young adventurer. If not, then begone for here be dragons (and their quests).    It's important to note that this volume is a legacy release. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai originally ran in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1989 to 1996. It has been adapted twice now in anime form, first by Toei Animation from 1991 to 1992 and again from 2020 to the present – the latter having an official simulcast and likely the iteration most international fans know it by. When the anime dropped in 2020 I had hoped this would mean a release of the original manga in English, and by the goddess we have been blessed accordingly.    I am legally and morally obligated to discuss Akira Toriyama when talking about Dragon Quest. Obviously, the character and monster designs of the video games all come from the esteemed mangaka, and the impact of his delightful work on the tone and popularity of the series is incalculable. It is not a stretch to say that when Akira Toriyama designed the humble slime all those years ago he distilled the very essence of Dragon Quest's character design to its purest form: to make a little guy, and to make him Very Good™. Dragon Quest: The Adventures of Dai may not be illustrated by Akira Toriyama, but Kōji Inada manages to reproduce his style quite flawlessly, from the buoyant rounded characters to even Toriyama's sense of comedic timing. Of course, it would be heresy to render a  Dragon Quest story in anything too far removed from Toriyama's sensibilities, but the art in this volume is nevertheless lovingly crafted and carefully done so as to maximize familiarity.    The writing is also quite familiar. Dragon Quest has evil monster kings, so The Adventure of Dai has one; Dragon Quest has Heroes, so the very idea of Hero is turned into an institution with the requisite ambitions and training arcs. Even the story beats and imagery are somewhat similar to Toriyama's other work in Dragon Ball – it's hard to see Dai training with a blade in the wilderness among monsters and not think of Gohan's time as a youngster doing much the same. The fact that these two stories ran nearly parallel in their publication makes them seem like echoes of one another, though of course the eventual outcomes make those similarities fade with time.    That's not to say there is nothing new here; in fact, there are plenty of subtle but meaningful changes that The Adventure of Dai introduces to spice up the formula. Simple things like having the first Hero and party we meet end up as conniving ne'er do wells is a nice touch. Furthermore, Dai's status as a young boy raised by monsters lends him more of an outsider persona as opposed to many of Dragon Quest's protagonists, most of whom are simply young blank slates for the player to project onto (to varying degrees of course). The development of side characters like Avan and Popp shows plenty of promise, and Dai's crest hints at future mysteries to be unraveled. Add in the potential rogues gallery of Hadlar's various generals, and there's plenty of future fun to be had.    This volume is also much smaller in scope than you might expect. Dragon Quest is a series that – among other things – has garnered a reputation for its breadth. Visiting different locales, each with their own tiny tales, and resolving local problems before moving on to the next place has become one of the franchise's defining features (again, to varying degrees across titles). However, The Adventure of Dai spends nearly the entirety of its first volume on the monster island, focusing on Dai's training. This limits the scope but allows us to spend more time with him and Gomechan, developing a strong bond that can serve as an anchor to the narrative. If you've watched the anime you know that Dai will eventually travel, but its always a good call for a long-running manga to establish an early investment in its characters.    If there are any negatives to be had, they mostly come by association. As I mentioned before, if you're not in the mood for more Dragon Quest… well, this won't convince you otherwise – this is for true believers who want to see slimes get hit by Kasizzle. There's also a bit of a… soft touch to everything. The Adventure of Dai is very much in the classic shonen mold, a soft bubbly tale for a younger audience that is neither too complicated nor thought-provoking. This is intentional, and I personally don't think it is a negative, but if you are used to the slight edge that modern shonen works have you might be disappointed to find something aimed at *gasp* children.    All in all, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai's first volume is a solid start to a solid series that gives you exactly what it says on the tin: Dragon Quest and some Adventures therein.

Review   by Grant Jones, Mar 29th 2022       Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Voiume 1                     Synopsis:               Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai tells the tale of the young warrior Dai. Dai is raised by monsters on an island and he is friends with a flying golden slime named Gomeachan. One day, this peaceful island is visited by a Hero and his companions – and they have nefarious plans. Soon Dai is being trained by the Hero Avan and befriends the magician Popp while being caught up in the broader struggle against the Demon King Hadlar.    Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Volume 1 is written by Riku Sanjo, illustrated by Koji Inada, and supervised by Yuji Horii. The English translation is by Gregory Werner, the lettering is by Steve Dutro, and editing is by Jennifer Sherman. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is published by Viz Books.

Review:            Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions? Or does the mere mention of its name invoke repetition and endless grind against a trope-laden backdrop that you have plowed through a dozen times before?    I say this because Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is a Dragon Quest manga through and through. It might sound ridiculous because… well, it's right there in the title, but it bears mentioning nonetheless. A video game franchise with a highly-respected legacy that has achieved an almost household-name status in Japan (and growing international fame), it's hard to find someone with zero opinion on the Dragon Quest franchise these days, and Dai actively courts this association with every fiber of its being. So in some sense this is a simple review: would you like more Dragon Quest? If so, proceed onward young adventurer. If not, then begone for here be dragons (and their quests).    It's important to note that this volume is a legacy release. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai originally ran in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1989 to 1996. It has been adapted twice now in anime form, first by Toei Animation from 1991 to 1992 and again from 2020 to the present – the latter having an official simulcast and likely the iteration most international fans know it by. When the anime dropped in 2020 I had hoped this would mean a release of the original manga in English, and by the goddess we have been blessed accordingly.    I am legally and morally obligated to discuss Akira Toriyama when talking about Dragon Quest. Obviously, the character and monster designs of the video games all come from the esteemed mangaka, and the impact of his delightful work on the tone and popularity of the series is incalculable. It is not a stretch to say that when Akira Toriyama designed the humble slime all those years ago he distilled the very essence of Dragon Quest's character design to its purest form: to make a little guy, and to make him Very Good™. Dragon Quest: The Adventures of Dai may not be illustrated by Akira Toriyama, but Kōji Inada manages to reproduce his style quite flawlessly, from the buoyant rounded characters to even Toriyama's sense of comedic timing. Of course, it would be heresy to render a  Dragon Quest story in anything too far removed from Toriyama's sensibilities, but the art in this volume is nevertheless lovingly crafted and carefully done so as to maximize familiarity.    The writing is also quite familiar. Dragon Quest has evil monster kings, so The Adventure of Dai has one; Dragon Quest has Heroes, so the very idea of Hero is turned into an institution with the requisite ambitions and training arcs. Even the story beats and imagery are somewhat similar to Toriyama's other work in Dragon Ball – it's hard to see Dai training with a blade in the wilderness among monsters and not think of Gohan's time as a youngster doing much the same. The fact that these two stories ran nearly parallel in their publication makes them seem like echoes of one another, though of course the eventual outcomes make those similarities fade with time.    That's not to say there is nothing new here; in fact, there are plenty of subtle but meaningful changes that The Adventure of Dai introduces to spice up the formula. Simple things like having the first Hero and party we meet end up as conniving ne'er do wells is a nice touch. Furthermore, Dai's status as a young boy raised by monsters lends him more of an outsider persona as opposed to many of Dragon Quest's protagonists, most of whom are simply young blank slates for the player to project onto (to varying degrees of course). The development of side characters like Avan and Popp shows plenty of promise, and Dai's crest hints at future mysteries to be unraveled. Add in the potential rogues gallery of Hadlar's various generals, and there's plenty of future fun to be had.    This volume is also much smaller in scope than you might expect. Dragon Quest is a series that – among other things – has garnered a reputation for its breadth. Visiting different locales, each with their own tiny tales, and resolving local problems before moving on to the next place has become one of the franchise's defining features (again, to varying degrees across titles). However, The Adventure of Dai spends nearly the entirety of its first volume on the monster island, focusing on Dai's training. This limits the scope but allows us to spend more time with him and Gomechan, developing a strong bond that can serve as an anchor to the narrative. If you've watched the anime you know that Dai will eventually travel, but its always a good call for a long-running manga to establish an early investment in its characters.    If there are any negatives to be had, they mostly come by association. As I mentioned before, if you're not in the mood for more Dragon Quest… well, this won't convince you otherwise – this is for true believers who want to see slimes get hit by Kasizzle. There's also a bit of a… soft touch to everything. The Adventure of Dai is very much in the classic shonen mold, a soft bubbly tale for a younger audience that is neither too complicated nor thought-provoking. This is intentional, and I personally don't think it is a negative, but if you are used to the slight edge that modern shonen works have you might be disappointed to find something aimed at *gasp* children.    All in all, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai's first volume is a solid start to a solid series that gives you exactly what it says on the tin: Dragon Quest and some Adventures therein.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Story : B- Art : A-  + Quintessential Dragon Quest comfort food, fun and light − Being aimed at a younger audience means that it can be predictable            discuss this in the forum (11 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story: Riku Sanjō   Art: Kōji Inada   Full encyclopedia details aboutDragon Quest: Dai no Daibōken (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Review   by Grant Jones, Mar 29th 2022       Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Voiume 1                     Synopsis:               Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai tells the tale of the young warrior Dai. Dai is raised by monsters on an island and he is friends with a flying golden slime named Gomeachan. One day, this peaceful island is visited by a Hero and his companions – and they have nefarious plans. Soon Dai is being trained by the Hero Avan and befriends the magician Popp while being caught up in the broader struggle against the Demon King Hadlar.    Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Volume 1 is written by Riku Sanjo, illustrated by Koji Inada, and supervised by Yuji Horii. The English translation is by Gregory Werner, the lettering is by Steve Dutro, and editing is by Jennifer Sherman. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is published by Viz Books.

Review:            Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions? Or does the mere mention of its name invoke repetition and endless grind against a trope-laden backdrop that you have plowed through a dozen times before?    I say this because Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is a Dragon Quest manga through and through. It might sound ridiculous because… well, it's right there in the title, but it bears mentioning nonetheless. A video game franchise with a highly-respected legacy that has achieved an almost household-name status in Japan (and growing international fame), it's hard to find someone with zero opinion on the Dragon Quest franchise these days, and Dai actively courts this association with every fiber of its being. So in some sense this is a simple review: would you like more Dragon Quest? If so, proceed onward young adventurer. If not, then begone for here be dragons (and their quests).    It's important to note that this volume is a legacy release. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai originally ran in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1989 to 1996. It has been adapted twice now in anime form, first by Toei Animation from 1991 to 1992 and again from 2020 to the present – the latter having an official simulcast and likely the iteration most international fans know it by. When the anime dropped in 2020 I had hoped this would mean a release of the original manga in English, and by the goddess we have been blessed accordingly.    I am legally and morally obligated to discuss Akira Toriyama when talking about Dragon Quest. Obviously, the character and monster designs of the video games all come from the esteemed mangaka, and the impact of his delightful work on the tone and popularity of the series is incalculable. It is not a stretch to say that when Akira Toriyama designed the humble slime all those years ago he distilled the very essence of Dragon Quest's character design to its purest form: to make a little guy, and to make him Very Good™. Dragon Quest: The Adventures of Dai may not be illustrated by Akira Toriyama, but Kōji Inada manages to reproduce his style quite flawlessly, from the buoyant rounded characters to even Toriyama's sense of comedic timing. Of course, it would be heresy to render a  Dragon Quest story in anything too far removed from Toriyama's sensibilities, but the art in this volume is nevertheless lovingly crafted and carefully done so as to maximize familiarity.    The writing is also quite familiar. Dragon Quest has evil monster kings, so The Adventure of Dai has one; Dragon Quest has Heroes, so the very idea of Hero is turned into an institution with the requisite ambitions and training arcs. Even the story beats and imagery are somewhat similar to Toriyama's other work in Dragon Ball – it's hard to see Dai training with a blade in the wilderness among monsters and not think of Gohan's time as a youngster doing much the same. The fact that these two stories ran nearly parallel in their publication makes them seem like echoes of one another, though of course the eventual outcomes make those similarities fade with time.    That's not to say there is nothing new here; in fact, there are plenty of subtle but meaningful changes that The Adventure of Dai introduces to spice up the formula. Simple things like having the first Hero and party we meet end up as conniving ne'er do wells is a nice touch. Furthermore, Dai's status as a young boy raised by monsters lends him more of an outsider persona as opposed to many of Dragon Quest's protagonists, most of whom are simply young blank slates for the player to project onto (to varying degrees of course). The development of side characters like Avan and Popp shows plenty of promise, and Dai's crest hints at future mysteries to be unraveled. Add in the potential rogues gallery of Hadlar's various generals, and there's plenty of future fun to be had.    This volume is also much smaller in scope than you might expect. Dragon Quest is a series that – among other things – has garnered a reputation for its breadth. Visiting different locales, each with their own tiny tales, and resolving local problems before moving on to the next place has become one of the franchise's defining features (again, to varying degrees across titles). However, The Adventure of Dai spends nearly the entirety of its first volume on the monster island, focusing on Dai's training. This limits the scope but allows us to spend more time with him and Gomechan, developing a strong bond that can serve as an anchor to the narrative. If you've watched the anime you know that Dai will eventually travel, but its always a good call for a long-running manga to establish an early investment in its characters.    If there are any negatives to be had, they mostly come by association. As I mentioned before, if you're not in the mood for more Dragon Quest… well, this won't convince you otherwise – this is for true believers who want to see slimes get hit by Kasizzle. There's also a bit of a… soft touch to everything. The Adventure of Dai is very much in the classic shonen mold, a soft bubbly tale for a younger audience that is neither too complicated nor thought-provoking. This is intentional, and I personally don't think it is a negative, but if you are used to the slight edge that modern shonen works have you might be disappointed to find something aimed at *gasp* children.    All in all, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai's first volume is a solid start to a solid series that gives you exactly what it says on the tin: Dragon Quest and some Adventures therein.

Review   by Grant Jones, Mar 29th 2022       Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Voiume 1                     Synopsis:               Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai tells the tale of the young warrior Dai. Dai is raised by monsters on an island and he is friends with a flying golden slime named Gomeachan. One day, this peaceful island is visited by a Hero and his companions – and they have nefarious plans. Soon Dai is being trained by the Hero Avan and befriends the magician Popp while being caught up in the broader struggle against the Demon King Hadlar.    Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Volume 1 is written by Riku Sanjo, illustrated by Koji Inada, and supervised by Yuji Horii. The English translation is by Gregory Werner, the lettering is by Steve Dutro, and editing is by Jennifer Sherman. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is published by Viz Books.

Review:            Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions? Or does the mere mention of its name invoke repetition and endless grind against a trope-laden backdrop that you have plowed through a dozen times before?    I say this because Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is a Dragon Quest manga through and through. It might sound ridiculous because… well, it's right there in the title, but it bears mentioning nonetheless. A video game franchise with a highly-respected legacy that has achieved an almost household-name status in Japan (and growing international fame), it's hard to find someone with zero opinion on the Dragon Quest franchise these days, and Dai actively courts this association with every fiber of its being. So in some sense this is a simple review: would you like more Dragon Quest? If so, proceed onward young adventurer. If not, then begone for here be dragons (and their quests).    It's important to note that this volume is a legacy release. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai originally ran in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1989 to 1996. It has been adapted twice now in anime form, first by Toei Animation from 1991 to 1992 and again from 2020 to the present – the latter having an official simulcast and likely the iteration most international fans know it by. When the anime dropped in 2020 I had hoped this would mean a release of the original manga in English, and by the goddess we have been blessed accordingly.    I am legally and morally obligated to discuss Akira Toriyama when talking about Dragon Quest. Obviously, the character and monster designs of the video games all come from the esteemed mangaka, and the impact of his delightful work on the tone and popularity of the series is incalculable. It is not a stretch to say that when Akira Toriyama designed the humble slime all those years ago he distilled the very essence of Dragon Quest's character design to its purest form: to make a little guy, and to make him Very Good™. Dragon Quest: The Adventures of Dai may not be illustrated by Akira Toriyama, but Kōji Inada manages to reproduce his style quite flawlessly, from the buoyant rounded characters to even Toriyama's sense of comedic timing. Of course, it would be heresy to render a  Dragon Quest story in anything too far removed from Toriyama's sensibilities, but the art in this volume is nevertheless lovingly crafted and carefully done so as to maximize familiarity.    The writing is also quite familiar. Dragon Quest has evil monster kings, so The Adventure of Dai has one; Dragon Quest has Heroes, so the very idea of Hero is turned into an institution with the requisite ambitions and training arcs. Even the story beats and imagery are somewhat similar to Toriyama's other work in Dragon Ball – it's hard to see Dai training with a blade in the wilderness among monsters and not think of Gohan's time as a youngster doing much the same. The fact that these two stories ran nearly parallel in their publication makes them seem like echoes of one another, though of course the eventual outcomes make those similarities fade with time.    That's not to say there is nothing new here; in fact, there are plenty of subtle but meaningful changes that The Adventure of Dai introduces to spice up the formula. Simple things like having the first Hero and party we meet end up as conniving ne'er do wells is a nice touch. Furthermore, Dai's status as a young boy raised by monsters lends him more of an outsider persona as opposed to many of Dragon Quest's protagonists, most of whom are simply young blank slates for the player to project onto (to varying degrees of course). The development of side characters like Avan and Popp shows plenty of promise, and Dai's crest hints at future mysteries to be unraveled. Add in the potential rogues gallery of Hadlar's various generals, and there's plenty of future fun to be had.    This volume is also much smaller in scope than you might expect. Dragon Quest is a series that – among other things – has garnered a reputation for its breadth. Visiting different locales, each with their own tiny tales, and resolving local problems before moving on to the next place has become one of the franchise's defining features (again, to varying degrees across titles). However, The Adventure of Dai spends nearly the entirety of its first volume on the monster island, focusing on Dai's training. This limits the scope but allows us to spend more time with him and Gomechan, developing a strong bond that can serve as an anchor to the narrative. If you've watched the anime you know that Dai will eventually travel, but its always a good call for a long-running manga to establish an early investment in its characters.    If there are any negatives to be had, they mostly come by association. As I mentioned before, if you're not in the mood for more Dragon Quest… well, this won't convince you otherwise – this is for true believers who want to see slimes get hit by Kasizzle. There's also a bit of a… soft touch to everything. The Adventure of Dai is very much in the classic shonen mold, a soft bubbly tale for a younger audience that is neither too complicated nor thought-provoking. This is intentional, and I personally don't think it is a negative, but if you are used to the slight edge that modern shonen works have you might be disappointed to find something aimed at *gasp* children.    All in all, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai's first volume is a solid start to a solid series that gives you exactly what it says on the tin: Dragon Quest and some Adventures therein.

Soon Dai is being trained by the Hero Avan and befriends the magician Popp while being caught up in the broader struggle against the Demon King Hadlar.    Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Volume 1 is written by Riku Sanjo, illustrated by Koji Inada, and supervised by Yuji Horii. The English translation is by Gregory Werner, the lettering is by Steve Dutro, and editing is by Jennifer Sherman. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is published by Viz Books.      Review:            Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions? Or does the mere mention of its name invoke repetition and endless grind against a trope-laden backdrop that you have plowed through a dozen times before?    I say this because Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is a Dragon Quest manga through and through. It might sound ridiculous because… well, it's right there in the title, but it bears mentioning nonetheless. A video game franchise with a highly-respected legacy that has achieved an almost household-name status in Japan (and growing international fame), it's hard to find someone with zero opinion on the Dragon Quest franchise these days, and Dai actively courts this association with every fiber of its being. So in some sense this is a simple review: would you like more Dragon Quest? If so, proceed onward young adventurer. If not, then begone for here be dragons (and their quests).    It's important to note that this volume is a legacy release. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai originally ran in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1989 to 1996. It has been adapted twice now in anime form, first by Toei Animation from 1991 to 1992 and again from 2020 to the present – the latter having an official simulcast and likely the iteration most international fans know it by. When the anime dropped in 2020 I had hoped this would mean a release of the original manga in English, and by the goddess we have been blessed accordingly.    I am legally and morally obligated to discuss Akira Toriyama when talking about Dragon Quest. Obviously, the character and monster designs of the video games all come from the esteemed mangaka, and the impact of his delightful work on the tone and popularity of the series is incalculable. It is not a stretch to say that when Akira Toriyama designed the humble slime all those years ago he distilled the very essence of Dragon Quest's character design to its purest form: to make a little guy, and to make him Very Good™. Dragon Quest: The Adventures of Dai may not be illustrated by Akira Toriyama, but Kōji Inada manages to reproduce his style quite flawlessly, from the buoyant rounded characters to even Toriyama's sense of comedic timing. Of course, it would be heresy to render a  Dragon Quest story in anything too far removed from Toriyama's sensibilities, but the art in this volume is nevertheless lovingly crafted and carefully done so as to maximize familiarity.    The writing is also quite familiar. Dragon Quest has evil monster kings, so The Adventure of Dai has one; Dragon Quest has Heroes, so the very idea of Hero is turned into an institution with the requisite ambitions and training arcs. Even the story beats and imagery are somewhat similar to Toriyama's other work in Dragon Ball – it's hard to see Dai training with a blade in the wilderness among monsters and not think of Gohan's time as a youngster doing much the same. The fact that these two stories ran nearly parallel in their publication makes them seem like echoes of one another, though of course the eventual outcomes make those similarities fade with time.    That's not to say there is nothing new here; in fact, there are plenty of subtle but meaningful changes that The Adventure of Dai introduces to spice up the formula. Simple things like having the first Hero and party we meet end up as conniving ne'er do wells is a nice touch. Furthermore, Dai's status as a young boy raised by monsters lends him more of an outsider persona as opposed to many of Dragon Quest's protagonists, most of whom are simply young blank slates for the player to project onto (to varying degrees of course). The development of side characters like Avan and Popp shows plenty of promise, and Dai's crest hints at future mysteries to be unraveled. Add in the potential rogues gallery of Hadlar's various generals, and there's plenty of future fun to be had.    This volume is also much smaller in scope than you might expect. Dragon Quest is a series that – among other things – has garnered a reputation for its breadth. Visiting different locales, each with their own tiny tales, and resolving local problems before moving on to the next place has become one of the franchise's defining features (again, to varying degrees across titles). However, The Adventure of Dai spends nearly the entirety of its first volume on the monster island, focusing on Dai's training. This limits the scope but allows us to spend more time with him and Gomechan, developing a strong bond that can serve as an anchor to the narrative. If you've watched the anime you know that Dai will eventually travel, but its always a good call for a long-running manga to establish an early investment in its characters.    If there are any negatives to be had, they mostly come by association. As I mentioned before, if you're not in the mood for more Dragon Quest… well, this won't convince you otherwise – this is for true believers who want to see slimes get hit by Kasizzle. There's also a bit of a… soft touch to everything. The Adventure of Dai is very much in the classic shonen mold, a soft bubbly tale for a younger audience that is neither too complicated nor thought-provoking. This is intentional, and I personally don't think it is a negative, but if you are used to the slight edge that modern shonen works have you might be disappointed to find something aimed at *gasp* children.    All in all, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai's first volume is a solid start to a solid series that gives you exactly what it says on the tin: Dragon Quest and some Adventures therein.

Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Volume 1 is written by Riku Sanjo, illustrated by Koji Inada, and supervised by Yuji Horii. The English translation is by Gregory Werner, the lettering is by Steve Dutro, and editing is by Jennifer Sherman. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is published by Viz Books.      Review:            Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions? Or does the mere mention of its name invoke repetition and endless grind against a trope-laden backdrop that you have plowed through a dozen times before?    I say this because Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is a Dragon Quest manga through and through. It might sound ridiculous because… well, it's right there in the title, but it bears mentioning nonetheless. A video game franchise with a highly-respected legacy that has achieved an almost household-name status in Japan (and growing international fame), it's hard to find someone with zero opinion on the Dragon Quest franchise these days, and Dai actively courts this association with every fiber of its being. So in some sense this is a simple review: would you like more Dragon Quest? If so, proceed onward young adventurer. If not, then begone for here be dragons (and their quests).    It's important to note that this volume is a legacy release. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai originally ran in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1989 to 1996. It has been adapted twice now in anime form, first by Toei Animation from 1991 to 1992 and again from 2020 to the present – the latter having an official simulcast and likely the iteration most international fans know it by. When the anime dropped in 2020 I had hoped this would mean a release of the original manga in English, and by the goddess we have been blessed accordingly.    I am legally and morally obligated to discuss Akira Toriyama when talking about Dragon Quest. Obviously, the character and monster designs of the video games all come from the esteemed mangaka, and the impact of his delightful work on the tone and popularity of the series is incalculable. It is not a stretch to say that when Akira Toriyama designed the humble slime all those years ago he distilled the very essence of Dragon Quest's character design to its purest form: to make a little guy, and to make him Very Good™. Dragon Quest: The Adventures of Dai may not be illustrated by Akira Toriyama, but Kōji Inada manages to reproduce his style quite flawlessly, from the buoyant rounded characters to even Toriyama's sense of comedic timing. Of course, it would be heresy to render a  Dragon Quest story in anything too far removed from Toriyama's sensibilities, but the art in this volume is nevertheless lovingly crafted and carefully done so as to maximize familiarity.    The writing is also quite familiar. Dragon Quest has evil monster kings, so The Adventure of Dai has one; Dragon Quest has Heroes, so the very idea of Hero is turned into an institution with the requisite ambitions and training arcs. Even the story beats and imagery are somewhat similar to Toriyama's other work in Dragon Ball – it's hard to see Dai training with a blade in the wilderness among monsters and not think of Gohan's time as a youngster doing much the same. The fact that these two stories ran nearly parallel in their publication makes them seem like echoes of one another, though of course the eventual outcomes make those similarities fade with time.    That's not to say there is nothing new here; in fact, there are plenty of subtle but meaningful changes that The Adventure of Dai introduces to spice up the formula. Simple things like having the first Hero and party we meet end up as conniving ne'er do wells is a nice touch. Furthermore, Dai's status as a young boy raised by monsters lends him more of an outsider persona as opposed to many of Dragon Quest's protagonists, most of whom are simply young blank slates for the player to project onto (to varying degrees of course). The development of side characters like Avan and Popp shows plenty of promise, and Dai's crest hints at future mysteries to be unraveled. Add in the potential rogues gallery of Hadlar's various generals, and there's plenty of future fun to be had.    This volume is also much smaller in scope than you might expect. Dragon Quest is a series that – among other things – has garnered a reputation for its breadth. Visiting different locales, each with their own tiny tales, and resolving local problems before moving on to the next place has become one of the franchise's defining features (again, to varying degrees across titles). However, The Adventure of Dai spends nearly the entirety of its first volume on the monster island, focusing on Dai's training. This limits the scope but allows us to spend more time with him and Gomechan, developing a strong bond that can serve as an anchor to the narrative. If you've watched the anime you know that Dai will eventually travel, but its always a good call for a long-running manga to establish an early investment in its characters.    If there are any negatives to be had, they mostly come by association. As I mentioned before, if you're not in the mood for more Dragon Quest… well, this won't convince you otherwise – this is for true believers who want to see slimes get hit by Kasizzle. There's also a bit of a… soft touch to everything. The Adventure of Dai is very much in the classic shonen mold, a soft bubbly tale for a younger audience that is neither too complicated nor thought-provoking. This is intentional, and I personally don't think it is a negative, but if you are used to the slight edge that modern shonen works have you might be disappointed to find something aimed at *gasp* children.    All in all, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai's first volume is a solid start to a solid series that gives you exactly what it says on the tin: Dragon Quest and some Adventures therein.

News Yurukill: The Calumniation Games Video Game's Trailer Previews Story   posted on 2022-04-06 22:30 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Switch, PS4, PS5 game launches in July in N. America, Europe, Australia    NIS America began streaming a story trailer for G.Rev's Yurukill: The Calumniation Games Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5 game on Wednesday:      The game will launch in Japan on May 26. The game was delayed from April 14 in order to improve the game's quality. The game will launch on July 5 in North America and July 8 in Europe and Australia, also after a delay. The game was originally scheduled to launch on June 7 in North America and on June 10 in Europe and in Oceania on June 17.    A PC release via Steam is also planned but does not yet have a release window.    The game has adventure and shoot 'em up elements, and will feature online leaderboards. Homura Kawamoto (Kakegurui) is the game's writer.    Saori Hayami performs the opening theme song ""Black Innocence"" as her character Rina Azami.    NIS America describes the story:  Sengoku Shunju wakes up in his prison cell. A woman wearing a fox mask introduces herself as Binko, and says: “Sengoku Shunju, you are a criminal sentenced to years in prison, you've been offered the chance to gain your freedom. You must survive the various ‘attractions’ in a certain 'amusement park.' If you succeed, your crimes will be pardoned."" ""No, you've got it all wrong, I've been falsely accused! I'm innocent!"" The victim of one of his alleged crimes appears. Her name is Rina Azami.   ""Sengoku Shunju. A name I will never forget. You killed my entire family. For that, I will never forgive you."" Sengoku is in prison, charged with arson and murder—for burning to death 21 people, including Rina's family. Naturally, the victim does not believe a word of Sengoku's claims of innocence. Besides Sengoku are four other groups of criminals and their respective victims.""    The accused criminals are called “Prisoners,” and the victims “Executioners.” Criminals and victims must pair up to face the amusement park's attractions. There are a total of six criminals and five victims. There are five teams: Mass Murderers, Death Dealing Duo, Crafty Killers, Sly Stalkers, and Peeping Toms. The Prisoners hope to overcome the challenges so that they may be pardoned.    Should the Executioners win, their wishes will be granted. At long last they will be able to avenge their loved ones. The challenges take place in a secluded amusement park called ""Yurukill Land."" All manner of secrets will be unearthed as the teams face each attraction. Who will survive the cruel, twisted place that is Yurukill Land?   The game will launch along with a drama CD that is only available with pre-orders in Japan.

News Yurukill: The Calumniation Games Video Game's Trailer Previews Story   posted on 2022-04-06 22:30 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Switch, PS4, PS5 game launches in July in N. America, Europe, Australia    NIS America began streaming a story trailer for G.Rev's Yurukill: The Calumniation Games Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5 game on Wednesday:      The game will launch in Japan on May 26. The game was delayed from April 14 in order to improve the game's quality. The game will launch on July 5 in North America and July 8 in Europe and Australia, also after a delay. The game was originally scheduled to launch on June 7 in North America and on June 10 in Europe and in Oceania on June 17.    A PC release via Steam is also planned but does not yet have a release window.    The game has adventure and shoot 'em up elements, and will feature online leaderboards. Homura Kawamoto (Kakegurui) is the game's writer.    Saori Hayami performs the opening theme song ""Black Innocence"" as her character Rina Azami.    NIS America describes the story:  Sengoku Shunju wakes up in his prison cell. A woman wearing a fox mask introduces herself as Binko, and says: “Sengoku Shunju, you are a criminal sentenced to years in prison, you've been offered the chance to gain your freedom. You must survive the various ‘attractions’ in a certain 'amusement park.' If you succeed, your crimes will be pardoned."" ""No, you've got it all wrong, I've been falsely accused! I'm innocent!"" The victim of one of his alleged crimes appears. Her name is Rina Azami.   ""Sengoku Shunju. A name I will never forget. You killed my entire family. For that, I will never forgive you."" Sengoku is in prison, charged with arson and murder—for burning to death 21 people, including Rina's family. Naturally, the victim does not believe a word of Sengoku's claims of innocence. Besides Sengoku are four other groups of criminals and their respective victims.""    The accused criminals are called “Prisoners,” and the victims “Executioners.” Criminals and victims must pair up to face the amusement park's attractions. There are a total of six criminals and five victims. There are five teams: Mass Murderers, Death Dealing Duo, Crafty Killers, Sly Stalkers, and Peeping Toms. The Prisoners hope to overcome the challenges so that they may be pardoned.    Should the Executioners win, their wishes will be granted. At long last they will be able to avenge their loved ones. The challenges take place in a secluded amusement park called ""Yurukill Land."" All manner of secrets will be unearthed as the teams face each attraction. Who will survive the cruel, twisted place that is Yurukill Land?   The game will launch along with a drama CD that is only available with pre-orders in Japan.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Dawn of the Witch   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (214 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Dawn of the Witch   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (214 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Dawn of the Witch   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (214 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (214 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Dawn of the Witch   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Dawn of the Witch   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (214 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,{}

Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (214 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.

Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (214 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.

Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.  ",positive,en,{}

The first PC we had at home was too old to run them. (We're talking monochrome screen)  The next could have, but the genre was kind of on its way out by then, and at that age, I wasn't able to buy my own games.  The only game like that that I played completely was Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, and that was at school, so it took basically a whole school year to finish since it could only be played a little bit at a time.

It’s funny I remember when we got our first computer we had Fate Of Atlantis and I think Secret of Monkey Island but could never get them to work….but the one Simpson game we had worked for some reason.     Quote:    But can a remake really capture what made Max Payne so special back in 2001?            People actually said more or less the same thing about the 3rd game offering up some of the most inane takes imaginable and yet many of those takes turned cold.   All that said these remakes could only improve upon the original games   Maybe take out the drug induced mindtrips from the first game (or make them not suck).   Have the first game’s story feel like less of three story drafts that were merged into one. Cause they couldn’t decide.   Maybe not spoiler[kill almost every surviving character from the first game sans Max.]   Let players play as Mona in both games instead of only briefly in the second.

That's great! Except for the part they neglected to mention in their big press release was that this isn't going to apply to the recently unionized QA testers at their Raven Software division. Oopsies!            Of course it won't. Pay for unionized employees had to be collectively bargained, not a unilateral change by management. Particularly since unions tend to negotiate higher levels od benefits, which are a cost just like wages. You can't expect to get that for free, of course, in the same way that employers respond to wages negotiated higher than productivity by increasing work demands, making the work environment cheaper, etc. Or conversely how nice work environments (extras like food, perks like haircuts) are used to suppress wage demands.   Unions are an understandable selfish reaction in times of high unemployment, just like rent control, as they both have the effect of freezing out newcomers. It's always better to just have a low unemployment and high housing abundance situation, but when poor policy (regulatory, monetary, etc.) denies you that, people will look into them.

That's great! Except for the part they neglected to mention in their big press release was that this isn't going to apply to the recently unionized QA testers at their Raven Software division. Oopsies!            Of course it won't. Pay for unionized employees had to be collectively bargained, not a unilateral change by management. Particularly since unions tend to negotiate higher levels od benefits, which are a cost just like wages. You can't expect to get that for free, of course, in the same way that employers respond to wages negotiated higher than productivity by increasing work demands, making the work environment cheaper, etc. Or conversely how nice work environments (extras like food, perks like haircuts) are used to suppress wage demands.   Unions are an understandable selfish reaction in times of high unemployment, just like rent control, as they both have the effect of freezing out newcomers. It's always better to just have a low unemployment and high housing abundance situation, but when poor policy (regulatory, monetary, etc.) denies you that, people will look into them.           Hey, look folks missing the point hard the point being that AVB is excluding the union employees to try and weaken/break the union. I think if they showed what they are doing to the union with no gatchas they would be on board that was much of there point.

Let's all share the medium-defining titles that, for some reason, we've never actually played!           I half expected you to bring up your running joke from a few years ago about having never played any of the Muv-Luv games. Speaking of, sometime you have a slow news week, you could tour the wreckage over in that franchise. They had to pull both their ambitious Steam game Project Mikhail and their gacha game Immortals due to launch disasters. In the latter case, players apparently figured out how to clone their pre-registration bonuses, giving themselves infinite loot.   Anyways, as for secret gaming shames, as much as I like JRPGs, I’ve never played a Persona game (getting Strikers free from PS+ doesn’t count). Since I’ve enjoyed the silly school stuff in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, I suspect I’d like it, but at this point, I think I’m just holding out for a Switch version of P5, so that I’m not tied to my couch playing it on PS4.

I'm a dyed-in-the-wool Sierra adventure game lover from the 90s, but I never had access to it. I never knew anyone who owned it, didn't know what order they needed to be played in, and wasn't totally sure what kind of game it was or if I'd like it. Maniac Mansion was the same, but it appeared on the Internet Archive a few years back so I at least have dabbled a bit with that one now.   Other shames: I've never played a GTA, Call of Duty, Resident Evil, or Metal Gear (except for Metal Gear itself which apparently doesn't really count). I've also never beaten A Link to the Past. I have it on multiple systems and have beaten almost every other Zelda multiple times, but I've never gotten very far with it despite Zelda being one of my favorite franchises.   That reminds me, several of the Zelda remasters are shining examples of how to do a rerelease for a modern console in my book. Utilizing the gyroscope of the 3ds to help with bow mechanics in Ocarina of Time was a fantastic addition. Aiming could have been a nightmare translating the N64 controls, but that one worked great. I also really appreciated the tweaking of sailing mechanics added in the Wii U version of Windwaker. I honestly prefer to play it rather than the GameCube version because of them.

The original Metroid is obviously a seminal title, but playing it nowadays is rough, even if you're using savestates. Zero Mission took the basic structure of the original game, expanded on it in multiple ways (including an excellent additional area), gave it stronger ties into the overall series lore, and made it all run on Fusion's fantastic engine, and it was a total blast. Samus Returns was also a pretty cool take on Metroid II.   As for gaming shames...well, too many to count. One of the worst has to be never playing Super Mario World, but at least I finally checked off Super Metroid last year. I've also never played Monkey Island, or really any of the classic LucasArts titles. My journey into the adventure game world pretty much begins and ends with the Myst series.

Unfortunately those are very rare.  The two best ones I can think of are Resident Evil for the Gamecube and Metroid: Zero Mission.  Those are the kinds of remakes that I will genuinely prefer over the original and feel like I not only did not lose anything, but gained so much more.  I'm tempted to put Trials of Mana/Seiken Densetsu 3 on that list as well since it was an amazing remake.    I'm hoping the Dragon Quest 3 remake coming out can be put on this list since it looks amazing from the previews.     Conversely, the Secret of Mana remake was atrocious and I'll play the original version over it any day of the week.  Sadly those kinds of remakes are far more common.  Turtles in Time Re-Shelled was another one.  These are the ones where the graphics, music, and gameplay are worse than the original and lack all the charm and fun.  You can throw Mobile ports into this category too.   Right in the middle are just ROM dumps.  About as basic and straightforward as you can get.  Unless the emulation is bad then there's not much difference.  Although I'll usually play the original in my collection or emulation if I don't have it since emulation upscales always seem to be better than official ports.   Last but not least are the simple remasters that just AI upscale graphics and make some minor tweeks like Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy 8.  Usually with additional censorship changes that make it flat out worse than the original versions.  I don't find much point in them.  Saga Frontier was an alright one though since they restored some of the cut content which justifies it existing but most don't do that.   Speaking of Monkey Island, I have both the special editions on Steam and the best thing about them is playing them with original graphics (not a fan of the new art) with voices.  Playing Monkey Island 1 with the voice-actors from 3 and 4 but the original graphics is the best way to play it IMO.

A lot of it was from successfully updating a lot of the original mechanics and even doing some new things with SRPGs. It also added a lot of new narrative elements without undermining the original's story (-glances at FFVIIR-). And very timely to talk about it considering how Square has recently filed a trademark for something called Tactics Ogre: Reborn. Here's hoping it's a port.

I never did get in to point and click games much when they were all the rage, so maybe it was just over hyped by the time I played it, but I thought it was just fine.   Hmm, I haven't played either Persona Q games even though I love the series. Someday... someday.     BadNewsBlues wrote:      Maybe take out the drug induced mindtrips from the first game (or make them not suck).            Gonna have to disagree with you there, because I thought those were great (at least at the time). I think it made for a pretty nice change of pace and felt quite appropriately trippy.

FF7R doesn't bother me because it's not a remake so much as a sequel.  So all the retcons and changes don't bother me much since it's acknowledging it's not the ""true"" FF7 and it's screwing with the timeline and canon.  I can't imagine playing Remake without having played FF7 since the entire concept is basically Sephiroth trying to change the past.   For a remake that pollutes and undermines the original game's narrative I would have to say  Resident Evil 3.  Completely lacks the soul of the PS1 game and was just a cheap cash in on the RE2 Remake engine which wasn't nearly as bad.

One of my close Discord friends is heavily into the series and wants me to play them......now that I think about it, my Steam backlog is massive        Back to top                  maximilianjenus    Joined: 29 Apr 2013 		    Posts: 2579       Posted: Fri Apr 08, 2022 8:37 am            well, the unionized worked have their union, so what's the problem?

The first PC we had at home was too old to run them. (We're talking monochrome screen)  The next could have, but the genre was kind of on its way out by then, and at that age, I wasn't able to buy my own games.  The only game like that that I played completely was Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, and that was at school, so it took basically a whole school year to finish since it could only be played a little bit at a time.

It’s funny I remember when we got our first computer we had Fate Of Atlantis and I think Secret of Monkey Island but could never get them to work….but the one Simpson game we had worked for some reason.     Quote:    But can a remake really capture what made Max Payne so special back in 2001?            People actually said more or less the same thing about the 3rd game offering up some of the most inane takes imaginable and yet many of those takes turned cold.   All that said these remakes could only improve upon the original games   Maybe take out the drug induced mindtrips from the first game (or make them not suck).   Have the first game’s story feel like less of three story drafts that were merged into one. Cause they couldn’t decide.   Maybe not spoiler[kill almost every surviving character from the first game sans Max.]   Let players play as Mona in both games instead of only briefly in the second.

Hey, look folks missing the point hard the point being that AVB is excluding the union employees to try and weaken/break the union. I think if they showed what they are doing to the union with no gatchas they would be on board that was much of there point.

Let's all share the medium-defining titles that, for some reason, we've never actually played!           I half expected you to bring up your running joke from a few years ago about having never played any of the Muv-Luv games. Speaking of, sometime you have a slow news week, you could tour the wreckage over in that franchise. They had to pull both their ambitious Steam game Project Mikhail and their gacha game Immortals due to launch disasters. In the latter case, players apparently figured out how to clone their pre-registration bonuses, giving themselves infinite loot.   Anyways, as for secret gaming shames, as much as I like JRPGs, I’ve never played a Persona game (getting Strikers free from PS+ doesn’t count). Since I’ve enjoyed the silly school stuff in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, I suspect I’d like it, but at this point, I think I’m just holding out for a Switch version of P5, so that I’m not tied to my couch playing it on PS4.

I'm a dyed-in-the-wool Sierra adventure game lover from the 90s, but I never had access to it. I never knew anyone who owned it, didn't know what order they needed to be played in, and wasn't totally sure what kind of game it was or if I'd like it. Maniac Mansion was the same, but it appeared on the Internet Archive a few years back so I at least have dabbled a bit with that one now.   Other shames: I've never played a GTA, Call of Duty, Resident Evil, or Metal Gear (except for Metal Gear itself which apparently doesn't really count). I've also never beaten A Link to the Past. I have it on multiple systems and have beaten almost every other Zelda multiple times, but I've never gotten very far with it despite Zelda being one of my favorite franchises.   That reminds me, several of the Zelda remasters are shining examples of how to do a rerelease for a modern console in my book. Utilizing the gyroscope of the 3ds to help with bow mechanics in Ocarina of Time was a fantastic addition. Aiming could have been a nightmare translating the N64 controls, but that one worked great. I also really appreciated the tweaking of sailing mechanics added in the Wii U version of Windwaker. I honestly prefer to play it rather than the GameCube version because of them.

The original Metroid is obviously a seminal title, but playing it nowadays is rough, even if you're using savestates. Zero Mission took the basic structure of the original game, expanded on it in multiple ways (including an excellent additional area), gave it stronger ties into the overall series lore, and made it all run on Fusion's fantastic engine, and it was a total blast. Samus Returns was also a pretty cool take on Metroid II.   As for gaming shames...well, too many to count. One of the worst has to be never playing Super Mario World, but at least I finally checked off Super Metroid last year. I've also never played Monkey Island, or really any of the classic LucasArts titles. My journey into the adventure game world pretty much begins and ends with the Myst series.

Unfortunately those are very rare.  The two best ones I can think of are Resident Evil for the Gamecube and Metroid: Zero Mission.  Those are the kinds of remakes that I will genuinely prefer over the original and feel like I not only did not lose anything, but gained so much more.  I'm tempted to put Trials of Mana/Seiken Densetsu 3 on that list as well since it was an amazing remake.    I'm hoping the Dragon Quest 3 remake coming out can be put on this list since it looks amazing from the previews.     Conversely, the Secret of Mana remake was atrocious and I'll play the original version over it any day of the week.  Sadly those kinds of remakes are far more common.  Turtles in Time Re-Shelled was another one.  These are the ones where the graphics, music, and gameplay are worse than the original and lack all the charm and fun.  You can throw Mobile ports into this category too.   Right in the middle are just ROM dumps.  About as basic and straightforward as you can get.  Unless the emulation is bad then there's not much difference.  Although I'll usually play the original in my collection or emulation if I don't have it since emulation upscales always seem to be better than official ports.   Last but not least are the simple remasters that just AI upscale graphics and make some minor tweeks like Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy 8.  Usually with additional censorship changes that make it flat out worse than the original versions.  I don't find much point in them.  Saga Frontier was an alright one though since they restored some of the cut content which justifies it existing but most don't do that.   Speaking of Monkey Island, I have both the special editions on Steam and the best thing about them is playing them with original graphics (not a fan of the new art) with voices.  Playing Monkey Island 1 with the voice-actors from 3 and 4 but the original graphics is the best way to play it IMO.

A lot of it was from successfully updating a lot of the original mechanics and even doing some new things with SRPGs. It also added a lot of new narrative elements without undermining the original's story (-glances at FFVIIR-). And very timely to talk about it considering how Square has recently filed a trademark for something called Tactics Ogre: Reborn. Here's hoping it's a port.

I never did get in to point and click games much when they were all the rage, so maybe it was just over hyped by the time I played it, but I thought it was just fine.   Hmm, I haven't played either Persona Q games even though I love the series. Someday... someday.

Gonna have to disagree with you there, because I thought those were great (at least at the time). I think it made for a pretty nice change of pace and felt quite appropriately trippy.

FF7R doesn't bother me because it's not a remake so much as a sequel.  So all the retcons and changes don't bother me much since it's acknowledging it's not the ""true"" FF7 and it's screwing with the timeline and canon.  I can't imagine playing Remake without having played FF7 since the entire concept is basically Sephiroth trying to change the past.   For a remake that pollutes and undermines the original game's narrative I would have to say  Resident Evil 3.  Completely lacks the soul of the PS1 game and was just a cheap cash in on the RE2 Remake engine which wasn't nearly as bad.

It’s funny I remember when we got our first computer we had Fate Of Atlantis and I think Secret of Monkey Island but could never get them to work….but the one Simpson game we had worked for some reason.     Quote:    But can a remake really capture what made Max Payne so special back in 2001?            People actually said more or less the same thing about the 3rd game offering up some of the most inane takes imaginable and yet many of those takes turned cold.   All that said these remakes could only improve upon the original games   Maybe take out the drug induced mindtrips from the first game (or make them not suck).   Have the first game’s story feel like less of three story drafts that were merged into one. Cause they couldn’t decide.   Maybe not spoiler[kill almost every surviving character from the first game sans Max.]   Let players play as Mona in both games instead of only briefly in the second.

Hey, look folks missing the point hard the point being that AVB is excluding the union employees to try and weaken/break the union. I think if they showed what they are doing to the union with no gatchas they would be on board that was much of there point.

Let's all share the medium-defining titles that, for some reason, we've never actually played!           I half expected you to bring up your running joke from a few years ago about having never played any of the Muv-Luv games. Speaking of, sometime you have a slow news week, you could tour the wreckage over in that franchise. They had to pull both their ambitious Steam game Project Mikhail and their gacha game Immortals due to launch disasters. In the latter case, players apparently figured out how to clone their pre-registration bonuses, giving themselves infinite loot.   Anyways, as for secret gaming shames, as much as I like JRPGs, I’ve never played a Persona game (getting Strikers free from PS+ doesn’t count). Since I’ve enjoyed the silly school stuff in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, I suspect I’d like it, but at this point, I think I’m just holding out for a Switch version of P5, so that I’m not tied to my couch playing it on PS4.

I'm a dyed-in-the-wool Sierra adventure game lover from the 90s, but I never had access to it. I never knew anyone who owned it, didn't know what order they needed to be played in, and wasn't totally sure what kind of game it was or if I'd like it. Maniac Mansion was the same, but it appeared on the Internet Archive a few years back so I at least have dabbled a bit with that one now.   Other shames: I've never played a GTA, Call of Duty, Resident Evil, or Metal Gear (except for Metal Gear itself which apparently doesn't really count). I've also never beaten A Link to the Past. I have it on multiple systems and have beaten almost every other Zelda multiple times, but I've never gotten very far with it despite Zelda being one of my favorite franchises.   That reminds me, several of the Zelda remasters are shining examples of how to do a rerelease for a modern console in my book. Utilizing the gyroscope of the 3ds to help with bow mechanics in Ocarina of Time was a fantastic addition. Aiming could have been a nightmare translating the N64 controls, but that one worked great. I also really appreciated the tweaking of sailing mechanics added in the Wii U version of Windwaker. I honestly prefer to play it rather than the GameCube version because of them.

The original Metroid is obviously a seminal title, but playing it nowadays is rough, even if you're using savestates. Zero Mission took the basic structure of the original game, expanded on it in multiple ways (including an excellent additional area), gave it stronger ties into the overall series lore, and made it all run on Fusion's fantastic engine, and it was a total blast. Samus Returns was also a pretty cool take on Metroid II.   As for gaming shames...well, too many to count. One of the worst has to be never playing Super Mario World, but at least I finally checked off Super Metroid last year. I've also never played Monkey Island, or really any of the classic LucasArts titles. My journey into the adventure game world pretty much begins and ends with the Myst series.

Unfortunately those are very rare.  The two best ones I can think of are Resident Evil for the Gamecube and Metroid: Zero Mission.  Those are the kinds of remakes that I will genuinely prefer over the original and feel like I not only did not lose anything, but gained so much more.  I'm tempted to put Trials of Mana/Seiken Densetsu 3 on that list as well since it was an amazing remake.    I'm hoping the Dragon Quest 3 remake coming out can be put on this list since it looks amazing from the previews.     Conversely, the Secret of Mana remake was atrocious and I'll play the original version over it any day of the week.  Sadly those kinds of remakes are far more common.  Turtles in Time Re-Shelled was another one.  These are the ones where the graphics, music, and gameplay are worse than the original and lack all the charm and fun.  You can throw Mobile ports into this category too.   Right in the middle are just ROM dumps.  About as basic and straightforward as you can get.  Unless the emulation is bad then there's not much difference.  Although I'll usually play the original in my collection or emulation if I don't have it since emulation upscales always seem to be better than official ports.   Last but not least are the simple remasters that just AI upscale graphics and make some minor tweeks like Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy 8.  Usually with additional censorship changes that make it flat out worse than the original versions.  I don't find much point in them.  Saga Frontier was an alright one though since they restored some of the cut content which justifies it existing but most don't do that.   Speaking of Monkey Island, I have both the special editions on Steam and the best thing about them is playing them with original graphics (not a fan of the new art) with voices.  Playing Monkey Island 1 with the voice-actors from 3 and 4 but the original graphics is the best way to play it IMO.

A lot of it was from successfully updating a lot of the original mechanics and even doing some new things with SRPGs. It also added a lot of new narrative elements without undermining the original's story (-glances at FFVIIR-). And very timely to talk about it considering how Square has recently filed a trademark for something called Tactics Ogre: Reborn. Here's hoping it's a port.

I never did get in to point and click games much when they were all the rage, so maybe it was just over hyped by the time I played it, but I thought it was just fine.   Hmm, I haven't played either Persona Q games even though I love the series. Someday... someday.

Gonna have to disagree with you there, because I thought those were great (at least at the time). I think it made for a pretty nice change of pace and felt quite appropriately trippy.

FF7R doesn't bother me because it's not a remake so much as a sequel.  So all the retcons and changes don't bother me much since it's acknowledging it's not the ""true"" FF7 and it's screwing with the timeline and canon.  I can't imagine playing Remake without having played FF7 since the entire concept is basically Sephiroth trying to change the past.   For a remake that pollutes and undermines the original game's narrative I would have to say  Resident Evil 3.  Completely lacks the soul of the PS1 game and was just a cheap cash in on the RE2 Remake engine which wasn't nearly as bad.

It’s funny I remember when we got our first computer we had Fate Of Atlantis and I think Secret of Monkey Island but could never get them to work….but the one Simpson game we had worked for some reason.     Quote:    But can a remake really capture what made Max Payne so special back in 2001?            People actually said more or less the same thing about the 3rd game offering up some of the most inane takes imaginable and yet many of those takes turned cold.   All that said these remakes could only improve upon the original games   Maybe take out the drug induced mindtrips from the first game (or make them not suck).   Have the first game’s story feel like less of three story drafts that were merged into one. Cause they couldn’t decide.   Maybe not spoiler[kill almost every surviving character from the first game sans Max.]   Let players play as Mona in both games instead of only briefly in the second.

Hey, look folks missing the point hard the point being that AVB is excluding the union employees to try and weaken/break the union. I think if they showed what they are doing to the union with no gatchas they would be on board that was much of there point.

Let's all share the medium-defining titles that, for some reason, we've never actually played!           I half expected you to bring up your running joke from a few years ago about having never played any of the Muv-Luv games. Speaking of, sometime you have a slow news week, you could tour the wreckage over in that franchise. They had to pull both their ambitious Steam game Project Mikhail and their gacha game Immortals due to launch disasters. In the latter case, players apparently figured out how to clone their pre-registration bonuses, giving themselves infinite loot.   Anyways, as for secret gaming shames, as much as I like JRPGs, I’ve never played a Persona game (getting Strikers free from PS+ doesn’t count). Since I’ve enjoyed the silly school stuff in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, I suspect I’d like it, but at this point, I think I’m just holding out for a Switch version of P5, so that I’m not tied to my couch playing it on PS4.      Back to top                  Triltaison    Joined: 03 Jul 2011 		    Posts: 527       Posted: Fri Apr 08, 2022 4:30 pm            I, too, have Monkey Island as a secret shame. I'm a dyed-in-the-wool Sierra adventure game lover from the 90s, but I never had access to it. I never knew anyone who owned it, didn't know what order they needed to be played in, and wasn't totally sure what kind of game it was or if I'd like it. Maniac Mansion was the same, but it appeared on the Internet Archive a few years back so I at least have dabbled a bit with that one now.   Other shames: I've never played a GTA, Call of Duty, Resident Evil, or Metal Gear (except for Metal Gear itself which apparently doesn't really count). I've also never beaten A Link to the Past. I have it on multiple systems and have beaten almost every other Zelda multiple times, but I've never gotten very far with it despite Zelda being one of my favorite franchises.   That reminds me, several of the Zelda remasters are shining examples of how to do a rerelease for a modern console in my book. Utilizing the gyroscope of the 3ds to help with bow mechanics in Ocarina of Time was a fantastic addition. Aiming could have been a nightmare translating the N64 controls, but that one worked great. I also really appreciated the tweaking of sailing mechanics added in the Wii U version of Windwaker. I honestly prefer to play it rather than the GameCube version because of them.

The original Metroid is obviously a seminal title, but playing it nowadays is rough, even if you're using savestates. Zero Mission took the basic structure of the original game, expanded on it in multiple ways (including an excellent additional area), gave it stronger ties into the overall series lore, and made it all run on Fusion's fantastic engine, and it was a total blast. Samus Returns was also a pretty cool take on Metroid II.   As for gaming shames...well, too many to count. One of the worst has to be never playing Super Mario World, but at least I finally checked off Super Metroid last year. I've also never played Monkey Island, or really any of the classic LucasArts titles. My journey into the adventure game world pretty much begins and ends with the Myst series.

Unfortunately those are very rare.  The two best ones I can think of are Resident Evil for the Gamecube and Metroid: Zero Mission.  Those are the kinds of remakes that I will genuinely prefer over the original and feel like I not only did not lose anything, but gained so much more.  I'm tempted to put Trials of Mana/Seiken Densetsu 3 on that list as well since it was an amazing remake.    I'm hoping the Dragon Quest 3 remake coming out can be put on this list since it looks amazing from the previews.     Conversely, the Secret of Mana remake was atrocious and I'll play the original version over it any day of the week.  Sadly those kinds of remakes are far more common.  Turtles in Time Re-Shelled was another one.  These are the ones where the graphics, music, and gameplay are worse than the original and lack all the charm and fun.  You can throw Mobile ports into this category too.   Right in the middle are just ROM dumps.  About as basic and straightforward as you can get.  Unless the emulation is bad then there's not much difference.  Although I'll usually play the original in my collection or emulation if I don't have it since emulation upscales always seem to be better than official ports.   Last but not least are the simple remasters that just AI upscale graphics and make some minor tweeks like Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy 8.  Usually with additional censorship changes that make it flat out worse than the original versions.  I don't find much point in them.  Saga Frontier was an alright one though since they restored some of the cut content which justifies it existing but most don't do that.   Speaking of Monkey Island, I have both the special editions on Steam and the best thing about them is playing them with original graphics (not a fan of the new art) with voices.  Playing Monkey Island 1 with the voice-actors from 3 and 4 but the original graphics is the best way to play it IMO.

A lot of it was from successfully updating a lot of the original mechanics and even doing some new things with SRPGs. It also added a lot of new narrative elements without undermining the original's story (-glances at FFVIIR-). And very timely to talk about it considering how Square has recently filed a trademark for something called Tactics Ogre: Reborn. Here's hoping it's a port.

I never did get in to point and click games much when they were all the rage, so maybe it was just over hyped by the time I played it, but I thought it was just fine.   Hmm, I haven't played either Persona Q games even though I love the series. Someday... someday.

Gonna have to disagree with you there, because I thought those were great (at least at the time). I think it made for a pretty nice change of pace and felt quite appropriately trippy.

FF7R doesn't bother me because it's not a remake so much as a sequel.  So all the retcons and changes don't bother me much since it's acknowledging it's not the ""true"" FF7 and it's screwing with the timeline and canon.  I can't imagine playing Remake without having played FF7 since the entire concept is basically Sephiroth trying to change the past.   For a remake that pollutes and undermines the original game's narrative I would have to say  Resident Evil 3.  Completely lacks the soul of the PS1 game and was just a cheap cash in on the RE2 Remake engine which wasn't nearly as bad.

I thought it was pretty good but derivitive, I've seen the basic theme before but it was well done.

I had a hard time paying attention to the sub of LOGH due to information overload and the dub really helps to ease that   The only issue is there STILL isn't the dub for seasons 1 and 2 on Crunchyroll yet   Edit: looks like they've finally put the first two seasons up at the same time as the first episode of 3 Last edited by MagicPolly on Fri Apr 08, 2022 3:22 am; edited 1 time in total     Back to top                  penguintruth    Joined: 08 Dec 2004 		    Posts: 8216 		    Location: Penguinopolis 		        Posted: Wed Apr 06, 2022 5:02 pm            I've found the DNT dub to be pretty average, overall. Voice actors like Aaron Dismuke and Clifford Chapin carry the rest of the cast. But it's good enough to present to others, so I'm fine with them continuing with the same people. It'll make it more accessible.

Past season several dubs were added on funimation, Crunchyroll and wakanim simultaneously  (well almost, morons at wakanim uploaded all dubs 1 week later on every Tuesday, with non removable cc subs in their apps...)   Only thing that changed is the name.   But honestly Crunchyroll/Funimation, go dub older shows asap please. Laid back camp ?
