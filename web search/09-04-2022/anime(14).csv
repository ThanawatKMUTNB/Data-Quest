Interest Demon Slayer Creator Draws Tanjiro In the Style of Japanese Classic Theater   posted on 2022-04-07 03:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee           A poster drawn by Demon Slayer creator Koyoharu Gotouge for an upcoming Noh-Kyogen theatrical adaptation of the manga was unveiled on Monday. The poster sees Tanjiro dressed in a traditional Noh garb that is styled in the black-and-green checkered pattern of the haori he usually wears in the series.     Noh and Kyogen are two accompanying forms of classic theater in Japan. Noh is a dramatic performance characterized by the use of masks and consists of elements of dance, music, and poetry. Kyogen, on the other hand, is a more comedic act that emphasizes dialogue. The two are traditionally performed alternately, with Kyogen acting as a kind of intermission between Noh sets, hence the designation Noh-Kyogen.    The performances will initially be held at Tokyo's Ginza Six Noh theater from July 26 to July 31, and later at Osaka's Ohtsuki Noh Theater from December 9 to 11.

Interest Demon Slayer Creator Draws Tanjiro In the Style of Japanese Classic Theater   posted on 2022-04-07 03:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee           A poster drawn by Demon Slayer creator Koyoharu Gotouge for an upcoming Noh-Kyogen theatrical adaptation of the manga was unveiled on Monday. The poster sees Tanjiro dressed in a traditional Noh garb that is styled in the black-and-green checkered pattern of the haori he usually wears in the series.     Noh and Kyogen are two accompanying forms of classic theater in Japan. Noh is a dramatic performance characterized by the use of masks and consists of elements of dance, music, and poetry. Kyogen, on the other hand, is a more comedic act that emphasizes dialogue. The two are traditionally performed alternately, with Kyogen acting as a kind of intermission between Noh sets, hence the designation Noh-Kyogen.    The performances will initially be held at Tokyo's Ginza Six Noh theater from July 26 to July 31, and later at Osaka's Ohtsuki Noh Theater from December 9 to 11.

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon.

This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.

The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately.

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately.

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives      ",positive,en,{}

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives    ",positive,en,{}

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives   ",positive,en,{}

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.

Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.

Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (214 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (214 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (214 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (214 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (214 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,{}

Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (214 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}

Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (214 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.

A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.

Nah, you're completely right - it's not Tadato, it's Yuito. KMR just got Yagoo'd by the article writer, with 唯 in his name translated as ""Tada"" instead of ""Yui"".

I love cats, and when they pass on they leave a very gap in your home and heart. My cats have lived to 18, due to a healthy diet and LOTS of TLC. If a cat's lifespan can be doubled, that would be awesome.   I'm in support of this research.

Nah, you're completely right - it's not Tadato, it's Yuito. KMR just got Yagoo'd by the article writer, with 唯 in his name translated as ""Tada"" instead of ""Yui"".

I love cats, and when they pass on they leave a very gap in your home and heart. My cats have lived to 18, due to a healthy diet and LOTS of TLC. If a cat's lifespan can be doubled, that would be awesome.   I'm in support of this research.

Review   by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 28th 2022       Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me GN 1                      Synopsis:               One day on her way to school, Marika Uruuno turns a corner to find her two best friends kissing each other. Though shocked to see this come out of nowhere, she begins to look around and notice two things. The first is that there are a lot more openly intimate girl couples around her then she remembers while the other is that she can't find a single male anywhere. It seems as though Marika has wandered into a world where men no longer exist, either being replaced with women lookalikes or just removed all together.    In a panic, Marika heads to the nurse's office to calm down. There she meets Lily Kazami, who is reading a book on parallel universes. Although she is ignored at first, Marika ends up telling Lily about her bizarre situation. Setting aside her disbelief, Lily offers to assist Marika on the condition that they go out together. Will they find answers to such a ludicrous scenario and will a romance between these two blossom along the way?

Review:            I must say, the title and initial premise of this two-volume series did have me wondering just how much the story would fall back on gay panic or other stereotypes for the sake of cheap comedy or fanservice. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how seriously the manga took itself, and that the inciting incident wasn't just an excuse to create an otherworldly comedic situation. Beneath the ridiculousness of The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri's premise – waking up one day to suddenly find that all the women of the world have become lesbians since men died off hundreds of years ago – is a genuine attempt at creating a narrative arc for our main characters, complete with a climax which seeks to resolve all loose ends. The question, then, is whether or not said attempt resulted in an engaging story. And I think it has, despite the fact that the manga doesn't always know the best way to stick the landing.    The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me starts off with a surprising amount of self-awareness as it introduces our main character Marika to a far more gay version of her life than she is used to. Predictably, no one believes her when she says that she is from another world, but then a girl named Lily decides to humor her, kickstarting a sci-fi mystery story about parallel worlds and questions about identity. Throw in some romantic drama and you have some pretty standard building blocks that at times mesh together surprisingly well. The story is self-aware about the ridiculousness of its premise;  Marika's claims of being from another world are met with surprisingly realistic reactions from other characters especially since, from their perspective, she's always been a part of this world and her suddenly talking about men runs right in the face of their own reality. Our two leads are very proactive despite their quirks and the story never really loses momentum throughout the two volumes; it has a very straightforward approach of getting its readers from point A to point B while still managing to work in moments of quiet introspection from our leads.    Themes of feeling out of place, feeling lost, and trying to figure out where your feelings for someone might come from are well-integrated into the story. When Marika goes on about how she never really fit in or how her private life seemed disjointed, it works both as a relatable character moment and a well-foreshadowed plot point. Lilly's characterization is a bit more standard, but no less genuine, especially since she carries a sense of desperation that only grows as the story progresses. These two have great chemistry together and while their banter can feel a bit cliché, the rest of their character interactions are capable of evoking both humor and emotional pathos.    This is in no small part thanks to the manga's artwork, which is an absolute highlight. Not only are the designs of our two leads distinct, but they also perfectly contrast with each other to reflect their differing personalities. There are some impressive panel layouts that help carry the emotional weight of certain scenes, and the manga's use of shading different variations of black or gray do wonders in setting up a scene. While a lot of the side characters do feel a bit lazy comparatively in their design, it's clear the artist knew what parts needed the most attention in order to convey what a character was feeling at any moment. The result is a manga that's very immersive; I would almost be tempted to recommend the manga just based on the artwork and fun main character interactions alone. Unfortunately, there are some major hiccups to the plotting that hold the manga back.    The author's decision to treat their story's premise with an air of seriousness and urgency means that they couldn't rely on any superficial or shallow resolutions. While the first third of this massive volume is strong and does a good job of setting up the mystery on top of some nice character moments between our two leads, when it comes time for the narrative to start progressing towards a definitive conclusion, you can feel the author buckling under the weight. There is an attempt to imbue a sense of logic to the circumstances that led to the manga's inciting incident, and while the theories discussed can be fun (if a little routine), the way in which we are given this information gets lazier as the book goes on, and new characters are introduced simply as plot devices to further the narrative without any real connection to anything else.    I could forgive these contrivances if didn't start affecting the aforementioned character interactions that I found so enjoyable. The story starts over-explaining where characters are and why they might feel the way that they do, as if every circumstance needed to happen for a reason that relates back to the main plot in some way. It all feels like the author had an intended ending in mind but attempted to prolong the story by adding additional details and revelations along the way, which can be exhausting to read. It genuinely became harder to appreciate some of the manga's better qualities because its plotting is so ingrained in how we get to those moments. Trying to come up with a plot-related reason for everything would only result in a story that's less believable overall. If the author just pulled back some of these twists and revelations, it might've led to more loose ends, but it would've definitely resulted in a more emotionally-fulfilling story.    To sum up, The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me was an interesting read that definitely had more to it than I originally thought. However, more doesn't always necessarily mean better. While the artwork is gorgeous and the character interactions between the leads start out believable, the story is too loaded with ideas and revelations to really appreciate them. To get a complete story in this massive volume is a good deal. However, you may end up walking away scratching your head instead of wanting more. I stand by what I said at the beginning of this review that there is an interesting story buried beneath this premise – I just don't think the author managed to tell it well.             Grade:      Overall : B- Story : C Art : A-  + Gorgeous artwork, strong start with believable character interactions and character reflections − Massive contrivances and over-explaining makes the plotting feel exhausting while also dragging down the genuine character interactions            discuss this in the forum (14 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Hiroki Haruse   Full encyclopedia details aboutWhole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Review   by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 28th 2022       Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me GN 1                      Synopsis:               One day on her way to school, Marika Uruuno turns a corner to find her two best friends kissing each other. Though shocked to see this come out of nowhere, she begins to look around and notice two things. The first is that there are a lot more openly intimate girl couples around her then she remembers while the other is that she can't find a single male anywhere. It seems as though Marika has wandered into a world where men no longer exist, either being replaced with women lookalikes or just removed all together.    In a panic, Marika heads to the nurse's office to calm down. There she meets Lily Kazami, who is reading a book on parallel universes. Although she is ignored at first, Marika ends up telling Lily about her bizarre situation. Setting aside her disbelief, Lily offers to assist Marika on the condition that they go out together. Will they find answers to such a ludicrous scenario and will a romance between these two blossom along the way?

Review   by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 28th 2022       Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me GN 1                      Synopsis:               One day on her way to school, Marika Uruuno turns a corner to find her two best friends kissing each other. Though shocked to see this come out of nowhere, she begins to look around and notice two things. The first is that there are a lot more openly intimate girl couples around her then she remembers while the other is that she can't find a single male anywhere. It seems as though Marika has wandered into a world where men no longer exist, either being replaced with women lookalikes or just removed all together.    In a panic, Marika heads to the nurse's office to calm down. There she meets Lily Kazami, who is reading a book on parallel universes. Although she is ignored at first, Marika ends up telling Lily about her bizarre situation. Setting aside her disbelief, Lily offers to assist Marika on the condition that they go out together. Will they find answers to such a ludicrous scenario and will a romance between these two blossom along the way?

Although she is ignored at first, Marika ends up telling Lily about her bizarre situation. Setting aside her disbelief, Lily offers to assist Marika on the condition that they go out together. Will they find answers to such a ludicrous scenario and will a romance between these two blossom along the way?      Review:            I must say, the title and initial premise of this two-volume series did have me wondering just how much the story would fall back on gay panic or other stereotypes for the sake of cheap comedy or fanservice. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how seriously the manga took itself, and that the inciting incident wasn't just an excuse to create an otherworldly comedic situation. Beneath the ridiculousness of The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri's premise – waking up one day to suddenly find that all the women of the world have become lesbians since men died off hundreds of years ago – is a genuine attempt at creating a narrative arc for our main characters, complete with a climax which seeks to resolve all loose ends. The question, then, is whether or not said attempt resulted in an engaging story. And I think it has, despite the fact that the manga doesn't always know the best way to stick the landing.    The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me starts off with a surprising amount of self-awareness as it introduces our main character Marika to a far more gay version of her life than she is used to. Predictably, no one believes her when she says that she is from another world, but then a girl named Lily decides to humor her, kickstarting a sci-fi mystery story about parallel worlds and questions about identity. Throw in some romantic drama and you have some pretty standard building blocks that at times mesh together surprisingly well. The story is self-aware about the ridiculousness of its premise;  Marika's claims of being from another world are met with surprisingly realistic reactions from other characters especially since, from their perspective, she's always been a part of this world and her suddenly talking about men runs right in the face of their own reality. Our two leads are very proactive despite their quirks and the story never really loses momentum throughout the two volumes; it has a very straightforward approach of getting its readers from point A to point B while still managing to work in moments of quiet introspection from our leads.    Themes of feeling out of place, feeling lost, and trying to figure out where your feelings for someone might come from are well-integrated into the story. When Marika goes on about how she never really fit in or how her private life seemed disjointed, it works both as a relatable character moment and a well-foreshadowed plot point. Lilly's characterization is a bit more standard, but no less genuine, especially since she carries a sense of desperation that only grows as the story progresses. These two have great chemistry together and while their banter can feel a bit cliché, the rest of their character interactions are capable of evoking both humor and emotional pathos.    This is in no small part thanks to the manga's artwork, which is an absolute highlight. Not only are the designs of our two leads distinct, but they also perfectly contrast with each other to reflect their differing personalities. There are some impressive panel layouts that help carry the emotional weight of certain scenes, and the manga's use of shading different variations of black or gray do wonders in setting up a scene. While a lot of the side characters do feel a bit lazy comparatively in their design, it's clear the artist knew what parts needed the most attention in order to convey what a character was feeling at any moment. The result is a manga that's very immersive; I would almost be tempted to recommend the manga just based on the artwork and fun main character interactions alone. Unfortunately, there are some major hiccups to the plotting that hold the manga back.    The author's decision to treat their story's premise with an air of seriousness and urgency means that they couldn't rely on any superficial or shallow resolutions. While the first third of this massive volume is strong and does a good job of setting up the mystery on top of some nice character moments between our two leads, when it comes time for the narrative to start progressing towards a definitive conclusion, you can feel the author buckling under the weight. There is an attempt to imbue a sense of logic to the circumstances that led to the manga's inciting incident, and while the theories discussed can be fun (if a little routine), the way in which we are given this information gets lazier as the book goes on, and new characters are introduced simply as plot devices to further the narrative without any real connection to anything else.    I could forgive these contrivances if didn't start affecting the aforementioned character interactions that I found so enjoyable. The story starts over-explaining where characters are and why they might feel the way that they do, as if every circumstance needed to happen for a reason that relates back to the main plot in some way. It all feels like the author had an intended ending in mind but attempted to prolong the story by adding additional details and revelations along the way, which can be exhausting to read. It genuinely became harder to appreciate some of the manga's better qualities because its plotting is so ingrained in how we get to those moments. Trying to come up with a plot-related reason for everything would only result in a story that's less believable overall. If the author just pulled back some of these twists and revelations, it might've led to more loose ends, but it would've definitely resulted in a more emotionally-fulfilling story.    To sum up, The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me was an interesting read that definitely had more to it than I originally thought. However, more doesn't always necessarily mean better. While the artwork is gorgeous and the character interactions between the leads start out believable, the story is too loaded with ideas and revelations to really appreciate them. To get a complete story in this massive volume is a good deal. However, you may end up walking away scratching your head instead of wanting more. I stand by what I said at the beginning of this review that there is an interesting story buried beneath this premise – I just don't think the author managed to tell it well.

Review   by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 28th 2022       Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me GN 1                      Synopsis:               One day on her way to school, Marika Uruuno turns a corner to find her two best friends kissing each other. Though shocked to see this come out of nowhere, she begins to look around and notice two things. The first is that there are a lot more openly intimate girl couples around her then she remembers while the other is that she can't find a single male anywhere. It seems as though Marika has wandered into a world where men no longer exist, either being replaced with women lookalikes or just removed all together.    In a panic, Marika heads to the nurse's office to calm down. There she meets Lily Kazami, who is reading a book on parallel universes. Although she is ignored at first, Marika ends up telling Lily about her bizarre situation. Setting aside her disbelief, Lily offers to assist Marika on the condition that they go out together. Will they find answers to such a ludicrous scenario and will a romance between these two blossom along the way?       Review:         Synopsis:          One day on her way to school, Marika Uruuno turns a corner to find her two best friends kissing each other. Though shocked to see this come out of nowhere, she begins to look around and notice two things. The first is that there are a lot more openly intimate girl couples around her then she remembers while the other is that she can't find a single male anywhere. It seems as though Marika has wandered into a world where men no longer exist, either being replaced with women lookalikes or just removed all together.    In a panic, Marika heads to the nurse's office to calm down. There she meets Lily Kazami, who is reading a book on parallel universes. Although she is ignored at first, Marika ends up telling Lily about her bizarre situation. Setting aside her disbelief, Lily offers to assist Marika on the condition that they go out together. Will they find answers to such a ludicrous scenario and will a romance between these two blossom along the way?      Review:            I must say, the title and initial premise of this two-volume series did have me wondering just how much the story would fall back on gay panic or other stereotypes for the sake of cheap comedy or fanservice. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how seriously the manga took itself, and that the inciting incident wasn't just an excuse to create an otherworldly comedic situation. Beneath the ridiculousness of The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri's premise – waking up one day to suddenly find that all the women of the world have become lesbians since men died off hundreds of years ago – is a genuine attempt at creating a narrative arc for our main characters, complete with a climax which seeks to resolve all loose ends. The question, then, is whether or not said attempt resulted in an engaging story. And I think it has, despite the fact that the manga doesn't always know the best way to stick the landing.    The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me starts off with a surprising amount of self-awareness as it introduces our main character Marika to a far more gay version of her life than she is used to. Predictably, no one believes her when she says that she is from another world, but then a girl named Lily decides to humor her, kickstarting a sci-fi mystery story about parallel worlds and questions about identity. Throw in some romantic drama and you have some pretty standard building blocks that at times mesh together surprisingly well. The story is self-aware about the ridiculousness of its premise;  Marika's claims of being from another world are met with surprisingly realistic reactions from other characters especially since, from their perspective, she's always been a part of this world and her suddenly talking about men runs right in the face of their own reality. Our two leads are very proactive despite their quirks and the story never really loses momentum throughout the two volumes; it has a very straightforward approach of getting its readers from point A to point B while still managing to work in moments of quiet introspection from our leads.    Themes of feeling out of place, feeling lost, and trying to figure out where your feelings for someone might come from are well-integrated into the story. When Marika goes on about how she never really fit in or how her private life seemed disjointed, it works both as a relatable character moment and a well-foreshadowed plot point. Lilly's characterization is a bit more standard, but no less genuine, especially since she carries a sense of desperation that only grows as the story progresses. These two have great chemistry together and while their banter can feel a bit cliché, the rest of their character interactions are capable of evoking both humor and emotional pathos.    This is in no small part thanks to the manga's artwork, which is an absolute highlight. Not only are the designs of our two leads distinct, but they also perfectly contrast with each other to reflect their differing personalities. There are some impressive panel layouts that help carry the emotional weight of certain scenes, and the manga's use of shading different variations of black or gray do wonders in setting up a scene. While a lot of the side characters do feel a bit lazy comparatively in their design, it's clear the artist knew what parts needed the most attention in order to convey what a character was feeling at any moment. The result is a manga that's very immersive; I would almost be tempted to recommend the manga just based on the artwork and fun main character interactions alone. Unfortunately, there are some major hiccups to the plotting that hold the manga back.    The author's decision to treat their story's premise with an air of seriousness and urgency means that they couldn't rely on any superficial or shallow resolutions. While the first third of this massive volume is strong and does a good job of setting up the mystery on top of some nice character moments between our two leads, when it comes time for the narrative to start progressing towards a definitive conclusion, you can feel the author buckling under the weight. There is an attempt to imbue a sense of logic to the circumstances that led to the manga's inciting incident, and while the theories discussed can be fun (if a little routine), the way in which we are given this information gets lazier as the book goes on, and new characters are introduced simply as plot devices to further the narrative without any real connection to anything else.    I could forgive these contrivances if didn't start affecting the aforementioned character interactions that I found so enjoyable. The story starts over-explaining where characters are and why they might feel the way that they do, as if every circumstance needed to happen for a reason that relates back to the main plot in some way. It all feels like the author had an intended ending in mind but attempted to prolong the story by adding additional details and revelations along the way, which can be exhausting to read. It genuinely became harder to appreciate some of the manga's better qualities because its plotting is so ingrained in how we get to those moments. Trying to come up with a plot-related reason for everything would only result in a story that's less believable overall. If the author just pulled back some of these twists and revelations, it might've led to more loose ends, but it would've definitely resulted in a more emotionally-fulfilling story.    To sum up, The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me was an interesting read that definitely had more to it than I originally thought. However, more doesn't always necessarily mean better. While the artwork is gorgeous and the character interactions between the leads start out believable, the story is too loaded with ideas and revelations to really appreciate them. To get a complete story in this massive volume is a good deal. However, you may end up walking away scratching your head instead of wanting more. I stand by what I said at the beginning of this review that there is an interesting story buried beneath this premise – I just don't think the author managed to tell it well.             Grade:      Overall : B- Story : C Art : A-  + Gorgeous artwork, strong start with believable character interactions and character reflections − Massive contrivances and over-explaining makes the plotting feel exhausting while also dragging down the genuine character interactions            discuss this in the forum (14 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Hiroki Haruse   Full encyclopedia details aboutWhole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Dance Dance Danseur   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Dance Dance Danseur   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Dance Dance Danseur   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Dance Dance Danseur   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways.

I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.

His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina.

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place.

News Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation 2 Game Gets Steam Release This Year   posted on 2022-04-08 19:30 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Network test starts on April 15    Bandai Namco Entertainment announced on Friday that its Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation 2 game will get a release on Steam this year. Bandai Namco Entertainment Southeast Asia is streaming a video for the game's upcoming network test, which will start on April 15.      Bandai Namco Entertainment also announced the release of its Gundam Navi App app for iOS and Android. The app collates Gundam-related news, and also allows users to watch official videos and browse a database for characters, anime, or mobile suits in the franchise.    Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation 2 is a sequel to the Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation and Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation Next games.    Bandai Namco Entertainment released the free-to-play game on the PlayStation 4 in Japan in July 2018. The game then launched in English for the PS4 digitally in October 2019. The game launched for PlayStation 5 in January 2021.    Bandai Namco Entertainment America describes the game:    Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation 2 builds on the critically acclaimed land-based combat of its predecessor and takes the 6v6 action up a notch with all-new space-based battles. Infantry battles add a new dimension to the in-game combat, giving pilots the ability to take part in the fight alongside mechas, placing bombs in enemy bases or requesting support fire to help decide the outcome of the battle. Additionally, customizable Mobile Suits offer players the opportunity to enhance their favorite mecha through Development Points earned in battle.  The Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation Code Fairy game for PS5 and PS4 launched digitally on November 5 with the first volume. The second and third volumes launched on November 19 and December 3, respectively. Each volume contains five episodes. The single-player action game is based on Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation 2.

News Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation 2 Game Gets Steam Release This Year   posted on 2022-04-08 19:30 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Network test starts on April 15    Bandai Namco Entertainment announced on Friday that its Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation 2 game will get a release on Steam this year. Bandai Namco Entertainment Southeast Asia is streaming a video for the game's upcoming network test, which will start on April 15.      Bandai Namco Entertainment also announced the release of its Gundam Navi App app for iOS and Android. The app collates Gundam-related news, and also allows users to watch official videos and browse a database for characters, anime, or mobile suits in the franchise.    Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation 2 is a sequel to the Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation and Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation Next games.    Bandai Namco Entertainment released the free-to-play game on the PlayStation 4 in Japan in July 2018. The game then launched in English for the PS4 digitally in October 2019. The game launched for PlayStation 5 in January 2021.    Bandai Namco Entertainment America describes the game:    Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation 2 builds on the critically acclaimed land-based combat of its predecessor and takes the 6v6 action up a notch with all-new space-based battles. Infantry battles add a new dimension to the in-game combat, giving pilots the ability to take part in the fight alongside mechas, placing bombs in enemy bases or requesting support fire to help decide the outcome of the battle. Additionally, customizable Mobile Suits offer players the opportunity to enhance their favorite mecha through Development Points earned in battle.  The Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation Code Fairy game for PS5 and PS4 launched digitally on November 5 with the first volume. The second and third volumes launched on November 19 and December 3, respectively. Each volume contains five episodes. The single-player action game is based on Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation 2.

News Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation 2 Game Gets Steam Release This Year   posted on 2022-04-08 19:30 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Network test starts on April 15    Bandai Namco Entertainment announced on Friday that its Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation 2 game will get a release on Steam this year. Bandai Namco Entertainment Southeast Asia is streaming a video for the game's upcoming network test, which will start on April 15.      Bandai Namco Entertainment also announced the release of its Gundam Navi App app for iOS and Android. The app collates Gundam-related news, and also allows users to watch official videos and browse a database for characters, anime, or mobile suits in the franchise.    Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation 2 is a sequel to the Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation and Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation Next games.    Bandai Namco Entertainment released the free-to-play game on the PlayStation 4 in Japan in July 2018. The game then launched in English for the PS4 digitally in October 2019. The game launched for PlayStation 5 in January 2021.    Bandai Namco Entertainment America describes the game:    Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation 2 builds on the critically acclaimed land-based combat of its predecessor and takes the 6v6 action up a notch with all-new space-based battles. Infantry battles add a new dimension to the in-game combat, giving pilots the ability to take part in the fight alongside mechas, placing bombs in enemy bases or requesting support fire to help decide the outcome of the battle. Additionally, customizable Mobile Suits offer players the opportunity to enhance their favorite mecha through Development Points earned in battle.
