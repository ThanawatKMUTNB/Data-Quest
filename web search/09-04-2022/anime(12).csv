Interest SAG-AFTRA Labor Union Issued ""Do Not Work"" Notice On Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai English Dub   posted on 2022-04-08 01:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Union urged members not to work on Ocean Media's dub last April    The Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) labor union issued a ""Do Not Work"" notice on the Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai English dub (listed as ""Dragon Quest: Legend of Dai"") on April 22, 2021. The statement is as follows:   Please be advised that Ocean Media, the producer of the English-language dubbing series Dragon Quest: Legend of Dai has refused to execute a basic minimum agreement that is in full force and effect for work with respect to this series. As such, SAG-AFTRA members are hereby instructed to withhold any acting services for this production until further notice. Please note, accepting employment or rendering services on Dragon Quest: Legend of Dai may be considered a violation of Global Rule One.   Therefore, all SAG-AFTRA members are hereby informed that no member may accept work or appear on the above production. Violating this order may result in disciplinary action in accordance with the SAG-AFTRA Constitution.    SAG-AFTRA represents over 160,000 performers—including voice actors—and negotiates contracts with studios to guarantee consistent pay, working conditions, contributions toward health insurance and a pension, and preferential casting for union members.    In the wake of the Crunchyroll-Funimation merger, anime dub actors have highlighted the historical and ongoing under-representation of union dubs in the North American anime dubbing industry.

Interest SAG-AFTRA Labor Union Issued ""Do Not Work"" Notice On Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai English Dub   posted on 2022-04-08 01:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Union urged members not to work on Ocean Media's dub last April    The Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) labor union issued a ""Do Not Work"" notice on the Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai English dub (listed as ""Dragon Quest: Legend of Dai"") on April 22, 2021. The statement is as follows:   Please be advised that Ocean Media, the producer of the English-language dubbing series Dragon Quest: Legend of Dai has refused to execute a basic minimum agreement that is in full force and effect for work with respect to this series. As such, SAG-AFTRA members are hereby instructed to withhold any acting services for this production until further notice. Please note, accepting employment or rendering services on Dragon Quest: Legend of Dai may be considered a violation of Global Rule One.   Therefore, all SAG-AFTRA members are hereby informed that no member may accept work or appear on the above production. Violating this order may result in disciplinary action in accordance with the SAG-AFTRA Constitution.    SAG-AFTRA represents over 160,000 performers—including voice actors—and negotiates contracts with studios to guarantee consistent pay, working conditions, contributions toward health insurance and a pension, and preferential casting for union members.    In the wake of the Crunchyroll-Funimation merger, anime dub actors have highlighted the historical and ongoing under-representation of union dubs in the North American anime dubbing industry.    The anime of Riku Sanjō and Kōji Inada's Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai (Dragon Quest: Dai no Daibōken) manga premiered in October 2020. Crunchyroll and Hulu are streaming the anime as it airs.

Interest SAG-AFTRA Labor Union Issued ""Do Not Work"" Notice On Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai English Dub   posted on 2022-04-08 01:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Union urged members not to work on Ocean Media's dub last April    The Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) labor union issued a ""Do Not Work"" notice on the Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai English dub (listed as ""Dragon Quest: Legend of Dai"") on April 22, 2021. The statement is as follows:   Please be advised that Ocean Media, the producer of the English-language dubbing series Dragon Quest: Legend of Dai has refused to execute a basic minimum agreement that is in full force and effect for work with respect to this series. As such, SAG-AFTRA members are hereby instructed to withhold any acting services for this production until further notice. Please note, accepting employment or rendering services on Dragon Quest: Legend of Dai may be considered a violation of Global Rule One.   Therefore, all SAG-AFTRA members are hereby informed that no member may accept work or appear on the above production. Violating this order may result in disciplinary action in accordance with the SAG-AFTRA Constitution.    SAG-AFTRA represents over 160,000 performers—including voice actors—and negotiates contracts with studios to guarantee consistent pay, working conditions, contributions toward health insurance and a pension, and preferential casting for union members.    In the wake of the Crunchyroll-Funimation merger, anime dub actors have highlighted the historical and ongoing under-representation of union dubs in the North American anime dubbing industry.    The anime of Riku Sanjō and Kōji Inada's Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai (Dragon Quest: Dai no Daibōken) manga premiered in October 2020. Crunchyroll and Hulu are streaming the anime as it airs.

One in the movie and the alternative in the TV series.

Outdated quote. They had been building to the ending, which involved apocalyptic events as had been fortold throughout the whole series. They were literally about to hit the climax. Then Japan had a devastating earquake and the magazine pulled it due to similar depictions that were already in the published content. They tried to find another magazine to continue it, but none picked it back up.   They've said they still want to continue it, but will have to rebrand andvrethink the ending, like they did Drug&Drop.     Quote:    Wait, I thought that X's ""ending"" (if we can call it like that) was in Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles.   But has been literally decades since I read it so I am not sure.            That was an alternate version of semi-similar events with a lot of the same faces, but they're not the same characters and there are some huge differences in that cast and world that make treating it as a continuation of X impossible. It doesn't follow where X left off anyway, and the Tsubasa world had a twist that tied it to Tsubasa's main plot, not X's plot. It's mostly just meant to be a nod to X.

Outdated quote. They had been building to the ending, which involved apocalyptic events as had been fortold throughout the whole series. They were literally about to hit the climax. Then Japan had a devastating earquake and the magazine pulled it due to similar depictions that were already in the published content. They tried to find another magazine to continue it, but none picked it back up.   They've said they still want to continue it, but will have to rebrand andvrethink the ending, like they did Drug&Drop.     Quote:    Wait, I thought that X's ""ending"" (if we can call it like that) was in Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles.   But has been literally decades since I read it so I am not sure.            That was an alternate version of semi-similar events with a lot of the same faces, but they're not the same characters and there are some huge differences in that cast and world that make treating it as a continuation of X impossible. It doesn't follow where X left off anyway, and the Tsubasa world had a twist that tied it to Tsubasa's main plot, not X's plot. It's mostly just meant to be a nod to X.

Outdated quote. They had been building to the ending, which involved apocalyptic events as had been fortold throughout the whole series. They were literally about to hit the climax. Then Japan had a devastating earquake and the magazine pulled it due to similar depictions that were already in the published content. They tried to find another magazine to continue it, but none picked it back up.   They've said they still want to continue it, but will have to rebrand andvrethink the ending, like they did Drug&Drop.     Quote:    Wait, I thought that X's ""ending"" (if we can call it like that) was in Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles.   But has been literally decades since I read it so I am not sure.            That was an alternate version of semi-similar events with a lot of the same faces, but they're not the same characters and there are some huge differences in that cast and world that make treating it as a continuation of X impossible. It doesn't follow where X left off anyway, and the Tsubasa world had a twist that tied it to Tsubasa's main plot, not X's plot. It's mostly just meant to be a nod to X.

Outdated quote. They had been building to the ending, which involved apocalyptic events as had been fortold throughout the whole series. They were literally about to hit the climax. Then Japan had a devastating earquake and the magazine pulled it due to similar depictions that were already in the published content. They tried to find another magazine to continue it, but none picked it back up.   They've said they still want to continue it, but will have to rebrand andvrethink the ending, like they did Drug&Drop.     Quote:    Wait, I thought that X's ""ending"" (if we can call it like that) was in Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles.   But has been literally decades since I read it so I am not sure.            That was an alternate version of semi-similar events with a lot of the same faces, but they're not the same characters and there are some huge differences in that cast and world that make treating it as a continuation of X impossible. It doesn't follow where X left off anyway, and the Tsubasa world had a twist that tied it to Tsubasa's main plot, not X's plot. It's mostly just meant to be a nod to X.

Outdated quote. They had been building to the ending, which involved apocalyptic events as had been fortold throughout the whole series. They were literally about to hit the climax. Then Japan had a devastating earquake and the magazine pulled it due to similar depictions that were already in the published content. They tried to find another magazine to continue it, but none picked it back up.   They've said they still want to continue it, but will have to rebrand andvrethink the ending, like they did Drug&Drop.     Quote:    Wait, I thought that X's ""ending"" (if we can call it like that) was in Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles.   But has been literally decades since I read it so I am not sure.            That was an alternate version of semi-similar events with a lot of the same faces, but they're not the same characters and there are some huge differences in that cast and world that make treating it as a continuation of X impossible. It doesn't follow where X left off anyway, and the Tsubasa world had a twist that tied it to Tsubasa's main plot, not X's plot. It's mostly just meant to be a nod to X.

They conveniently cancelled the manga due to the game being bad on the salesfront or it may be a case of publishers being overwhelmed by new and existing manga.

It wasn't a sales juggernaut but it wasn't a massive failure or anything. And it reviewed decently. Some hardcore [email protected] fans got mad about it, but they get mad about everything, and it wasn't really a big controversial thing or anything.   Seems like it really was just other circumstances.

They conveniently cancelled the manga due to the game being bad on the salesfront or it may be a case of publishers being overwhelmed by new and existing manga.

It wasn't a sales juggernaut but it wasn't a massive failure or anything. And it reviewed decently. Some hardcore [email protected] fans got mad about it, but they get mad about everything, and it wasn't really a big controversial thing or anything.   Seems like it really was just other circumstances.

This Week in Anime When in Rome, Bathe as the Romans Do  by Jean-Karlo Lemus & Monique Thomas, Apr  5th 2022           Thermae Romae Novae looks to reinvigorate Mari Yamazaki's historical comedy manga about bath culture with a brand new series on Netflix. Does this version manage to bring the silly charm or is its topic too niche?

Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans!

This Week in Anime When in Rome, Bathe as the Romans Do  by Jean-Karlo Lemus & Monique Thomas, Apr  5th 2022           Thermae Romae Novae looks to reinvigorate Mari Yamazaki's historical comedy manga about bath culture with a brand new series on Netflix. Does this version manage to bring the silly charm or is its topic too niche?    This series is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Heyyo, Jean-Karlo! Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans!

This Week in Anime When in Rome, Bathe as the Romans Do  by Jean-Karlo Lemus & Monique Thomas, Apr  5th 2022           Thermae Romae Novae looks to reinvigorate Mari Yamazaki's historical comedy manga about bath culture with a brand new series on Netflix. Does this version manage to bring the silly charm or is its topic too niche?    This series is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Heyyo, Jean-Karlo! Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans!

Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans!

With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans!

This Week in Anime When in Rome, Bathe as the Romans Do  by Jean-Karlo Lemus & Monique Thomas, Apr  5th 2022           Thermae Romae Novae looks to reinvigorate Mari Yamazaki's historical comedy manga about bath culture with a brand new series on Netflix. Does this version manage to bring the silly charm or is its topic too niche?    This series is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Heyyo, Jean-Karlo! Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work.

So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans!

Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.

And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.

It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans!

Does this version manage to bring the silly charm or is its topic too niche?    This series is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Heyyo, Jean-Karlo! Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail.

Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive.

A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese.

Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans!

Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace. There's a bit where the Senate sends Lucius on a snipe hunt to bandit-infested territory behind Mt. Vesuvius (the series takes place a few decades after Pompeii is razed). After visiting a spa town in Japan, Lucius is able to help the bandits turn over a new leaf and found a thriving tourist town in the process.    Also, in what is a very Japanese bit of humor, manzai routines make it through to Ancient Rome! As seen with these two dorks who have a whole Abbot-and-Costello bit about the price of souvenirs.      Again, we try not to think too hard about the anachronisms. Though I did really enjoy the one where Lucius ended up in an Edo period bath house and inn rather than a modern day one. And came back with a portrait of himself.    And it's small gags that really elevate the show from just edutainment. Though, there's nothing wrong from learning from something you enjoy.   The idea of Lucius ending up in the Edo period is making me want a Thermae Romae Novae/Doraemon crossover. I wanna know what Ancient Rome thinks of earless robot cats!    But I digress. Lucius also ends up at a Japanese waterpark and somehow avoids being put on a sex offender list for showing up naked at a public venue. It's a lot of fun seeing him presume the whole thing is some kind of weird training facility for children, to say nothing of how he manages to adapt it for the ancient Romans.      He's very fortunate that everyone just takes this suddenly naked man in good stride and doesn't call the cops on him immediately. I just feel bad for the poor girl running the showroom! Service jobs are bad enough without a weird time traveler you mistake for an Italian associate showing up in the buff.     Oh geez, her. She'd just started at that job and her boss tells he to keep an eye out for an Italian customer due in at any moment. So she gives Lucius the royal treatment when he shows up... but once he vanishes, she just looks like she'd been goofing off all day. I can only hope the worst she got was getting written up...   She actually handled things well all things considered, so I'd hope so. But the series is really at its best when it goes back to how people find ways to bond with each other. Even Lucius schooling a bunch of ruffians Roman-style for roughhousing in the bath too much ends up being very sweet because of how much he respects the experience when you share a space with others. But also he kicks ass with a broom.     Shout-out to the guy he fights, who apparently was an award-winning Russian fencer! Even going spear-and-board isn't enough to take him down.   Early on, there's also this elderly old man who struggles to bathe himself. Confusing Lucius for a caretaker, he walks Lucius through the process of at-home bathing. Lucius walks away convinced this old man could easily trump most of Rome by virtue of how decadent his lifestyle is.       He also gets the very unique experience of using a Japanese bidet toilet for the first time. Truly the modern world is full of wonders.     To be fair, that's about everyone's experience when they try a Japanese toilet for the first time. We also get to see Lucius experience ramen for the first time, which is also a treat because hey, good ramen will reduce anyone to tears.     But I think the real lesson is Lucius' incredible presence of mind towards his experiences. He doesn't think too hard about it. He takes everything in stride. And sometimes, he and the audience really get to enjoy themselves. You know what they say about being in Rome. Which is key to enjoying any series about life. He may be serious about his work but these pleasures are key to keeping him from being a boring workaholic even if they are part of his work!   Part of why Emperor Hadrian's requests of Lucius work so well at pacifying the populace is because... yeah, people do need these simple pleasures, and sometimes just feeling clean and warm is enough to improve your outlook. It's easy to take them for granted but they are nevertheless important and they can change your entire day.     They also talk a lot about the health benefits, and while I don't buy into some of the series' wellness culture talk (too many hot baths will actually dry out your skin), doing something that relaxes you, does improve both your mental and physical health immensely and will help reduce the toll of daily life.     It's a bit of a shame that Thermae Romae Novae only skims the surface of the manga because the story does go into interesting territory, but for what it does cover it is still nevertheless a surprisingly engaging series. The wit is sharp and charming, the set-up is wildly creative, and the series has a deep respect of everyone and the very idea of cultural exchange. This is the kind of thing that only could have come from a manga because I can't think of any other medium where this kind of concept would have been able to flourish.   I enjoyed the anime as a meditative experience, but I also prefer manga for this kind of informative dump because it's something I can go at my own pace about while enjoying the art. It's a lot more of a contemplative state than sitting in front of my computer desk. Especially when I don't have to binge a series because Netflix demands it. But I can still see people enjoying this on a casual level, and that's the exact spirit you should take away from Thermae Romae Novae. Once again, I implore you you to defy Netflix's dumb algorithm and enjoy anime at your own pace and keep talking about them even after the week that they air! Unlike bath water, anime doesn't become lukewarm just because it's not ""The New Hotness.""     Anime is a medium, not a genre or a fad. It's been here longer than a lot of us, and it'll be here when many of the out-of-touch execs are gone. Just like the ancient ruins of the Romans! As the ancient scribe once said, ""People called Romanes, they go the houses!""      ",positive,en,{}

Does this version manage to bring the silly charm or is its topic too niche?    This series is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Heyyo, Jean-Karlo! Finally, the past anime season is over and the new season is just beginning. It's really nice to be able to chill out reflect, and take some time off while we wait for the new shows to start up. Let me just check out the schedule to see if there isn't any surprise upcoming drops—Oh, Okay. Time to cancel my vacation plans because it seems that Netflix has other ideas.      Jean-Karlo  My heart goes out to our colleagues working on Preview Guide, they're definitely feeling the grind. I think we can all afford to take it easy and relax with a nice, long bath with the boys...     I think I'd rather be hunting some megafauna but mostly because that involves slightly less nudity. Anyways, This Week we're taking a deep soak in the experience of Thermae Romae Novae .      Thermae Romae is one of those weird concepts you could only really get away with in the world of anime and manga, a historical-fiction-slash-speculative-fiction story about an ancient Roman architect slipping through time to bring contemporary bathroom tech to the Ancient Romans. It shouldn't be as engaging as it is, and yet not only did Yen Press bring over the manga a few years back but it's had two animated adaptations—this one, Thermae Romae Novae, being the second one. And man, did this one surprise me!     The first adaption was a series of shorts animated in flash by DLE and those are surprisingly still available both for streaming on Crunchyroll and just released by our pals at Discotek. Thermae Romae Novae, on the other hand is a full series distributed by Netflix and animated by NAZ.   The last thing I fully watched by NAZ was the DRAMAtical Murder anime only because the animation was SO horrendous I couldn't stop laughing. So I wasn't really having high expectations for the shows production values dipping into this. I was actually a little worried. Mari Yamazaki is a wonderful artist and mangaka and there's a real charm to her original work. I'm still unsure if the anime transfers all the appeal but I don't think the show looks low quality either. Even a few of the CG sections impressed me with their creativity.      COVID has no doubt complicated the animation production system worldwide, hence why there are so many CG scenes in Thermae Romae Novae, but I wanna second their creativity. Most of the CG is otherwise kept to crowd shots (animating the passers-by) or tricky rotation shots that would be a lot harder to do with traditional animation. It's a far cry from DRAMAtical Murder for sure. Pic related, it's DRAMAtical Murder.     Not that studio is always directly tied to production values, mind. But the other staff credits weren't impressing me either. Some parts of the show still feel stiff and there's a grainy filter on everything but everything looses up once we enter the influence of the bathtub. Lucius Modestus is an aspiring bath architect living in Rome during the year 128 A.D. Being a third gen Bath Building Boy, he's very passionate about the power of being naked in some warm hot can have on people's lives. Something both Japanese and Ancient Roman cultures seem to have deeply in common, despite being separated by more than just time and space.     I don't know how true-to-life the Roman obsession with bathing is, but the show claims that the first things many armies do while marching is construct a bath at the frontlines. With Lucius living in Emperor Hadrian's era of Pax Romana (a time in Roman history where they pulled back a little on bellicose conquest), the population seeks out comfort even further, giving Lucius plenty of opportunities to work. His problem when the show begins is that he loves baths a little too much: being inspired by the constructions his father and grandfather made, Lucius's traditional designs come off as dull and old-fashioned to contemporary Romans enjoying the influx of new aesthetics and cultures absorbed by Rome's expansion.         There's definitely a lot about the setting that seems exaggerated to be more friendly to Japanese viewers but there's other aspects about their daily lives that feel really well researched and detail-oriented as well. And if you're a westerner who's a stranger to both cultures, it can lead to learning a lot of novel information.   There's definitely quite a bit that's accurate to the era—like the Roman-era toilets and how they scrubbed themselves with brushes on sticks. Rome was no stranger to advanced engineering feats like aqueducts and heating, so it's not hard to buy into some of the other feats achieved in this series. But that nevertheless leaves poor Lucius in a bind: finding new, innovative bath designs for the spoiled Roman population.      Yeah, as of now he needs inspiration for the new era. But where is he supposed to get it? Fortunate for him fate has other ideas and transports him to another world of modern Japan using the power of baths.     There's no explanation for Lucius getting transported to modern day Japan, and there doesn't have to be because it's just hilarious to see a bunch of pruney old Japanese people nodding sagely at a temporally-displaced Roman and going, ""Oh man, we got a poor foreigner here who's never seen a Japanese bath before. He's a real looker though, you could iron your laundry on those abs. Wouldn't mind that spread out on a cracker. He's a tall glass of water and I love moisture."" Meanwhile, in a bit of extremely-era-accurate-but-nevertheless-politically-incorrect humor, Lucius is convinced that all of the ""flat-faced"" Japanese people he meets are slaves and deigns it appropriate for him to pick and choose the bits of their engineering that suit him best.      The period-accurate racism is very uncomfortable if the whole thing wasn't so damn silly and really about teaching the dumb foreigner about the simple pleasures of Japanese culture like the power of fruity milk drinks. But it's also low-stakes to see everyone be nice to this extremely muscular fish out of water and try to teach him how to kick back and enjoy himself in a strange land. It has a similar vibe to something like Restaurant in Another World only instead of a lizard dude, he's just white.     This also ties into my thesis that the appeal of many isekai is actually just experiencing culture shock.   It's quite cute how so many of the Japanese people Lucius meets are simply pleasantly amused at this poor foreigner who doesn't speak the language. Also, being that he usually appears at bathhouses (with the exception of the time he pops up at a water park and a bathroom display store—we'll get to that later), not many people have to be freaked out about him being in the buff. As Terminator taught us, time travel has to be done in the nude.    It's also quite fortuitous that many of the people Lucius meets are of the older generation; many younger people in Japan are no doubt used to indoor bathing, but older Japanese people no doubt grew up in an era where many houses probably didn't have actual tubs or showers, leaving people to go to the local bathhouse for their bathing. There's a tradition that many younger folks probably can't appreciate; through Lucius, we don't just get to see how a foreign culture reacts to Japanese bathing, but we as an audience are able to see these old traditions kept alive.   Also, nothing to do with nothing but: I'm tickled pink by the Godzilla vs Hedorah poster in that one bathhouse. Also, Jaws and Enter the Dragon. Some old traditional place in Japan would definitely have movie posters from the 1970s up on the walls that haven't been taken down since they went up in the Nixon administration.      That's all part of the charm! Lucius even brings over that bit along with mural. It's a bit of a travelogue series mixed with heavy amounts of ""what if"" for what Lucius reverse engineers from modern day to his current era. Don't think too hard about the Butterfly Effect or anything.      It's funny because Lucius thinks the mural in the bathhouse is Mt. Vesuvius when it's actually Mt Fuji! But we'll let him think he's still in Rome.   But even with his misconceptions, he doesn't take these experiences for granted, he recognizes that even mundane objects are their own pieces of technology and convenience just like how a medieval peasant would shit themselves silly if you taught them how to properly season their food.      I love Lucius's attention to detail. He sees a cat-shaped shampoo bottle, he thinks, ""Clearly, the cat shape is what brings the thing together!""—and so he recreates novelty toiletries in Ancient Rome. A pity he never discovered the rubber duckie.     Even if he doesn't 100% understand the technology he understands the functions and the appeal and tries to mirror that to create a greater quality of life. Like he may not understand what a TV is but he understands that images are soothing. Other things are more universal even with the gap of thousands of years, like the experience of good food paired with some booze. I would kill for a hot spring egg and some sake.    After each episode there's also a segment where Yamazaki herself travels to different Japanese hot springs. It's a kind of variety segment we don't get to see very much. I love seeing her draw on her tablet after. She seems like a nice lady who like Lucius, really cares about the details and enjoying life.      What's sweetest about these segments is how much Yamazaki herself learns from her travels and how much it motivates her to potentially draw new adventures for Lucius! Yamazaki is a very curious person and it's just as fun seeing her experience all the lovely cultural aspects of Japanese bathing as it is to simply see them in action.    Again, there's definitely a spirit of wanting to keep these old traditions alive. There's a curious moment where Yamazaki discovers that water at a hot spring takes 30 years to travel through the ground, and another where she visits an inn that's over 100 years old. A lot of Japanese bathing itself feels like time-travel in its own way.     Both the travelogue segments and the main character of Lucius are voiced by the smooth Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Recently, I praised him for his gravely as all hell mobster characters in the past, but as Lucius he is at the opposite end of the spectrum as this serious and contemplative man with a very refined voice. Most of the series is listening to him monologue as he mentally tries to process whatever's in front of him, so it's key that his voice be interesting. David Wald gave an equally pleasant performance in the dub but these tour segments remain sub-only.   Speaking of sounds, I actually thought the music was an understated element. The show opens with a blasting aria, and we hear many interesting mixes of both classical and modern genres of both eastern and western influences until you can no longer separate them.    I was just amused to hear Tsuda's voice after his grave narration for To Your Eternity and him voicing a dog-boy in Sonny Boy. It's very amusing to hear him voice the comedically-unfunny Lucius, as well as his attempts at pronouncing Latin. Tsuda is really good at rolling those ""R""s.   Oh, I guess we should mention that our boy Lucius doesn't know a LICK of Japanese of course and is just constantly floundering through the language barrier through other people's extreme hospitality? Poor guy, not many people who took high school Latin around, I guess? Though, you'd only notice this during the modern-day segments. In Rome, everyone speaks Japanese for the audience's sake.      It's like The Hunt for Red October where Sean Connery and Sam Neill start speaking English when the camera zooms into their mouths. There is a gag in the manga that someone who is otherwise very passionate about Roman culture manages to learn Latin to communicate with Lucius, but this anime doesn't cover that part of the series in the adaptation. The most we get is a cute bit of bonding between Lucius and a young architect who is tasked with building a gaudy ""Roman-inspired"" bathhouse by a nouveaux-rich old man with more dollars than sense. The two bond over being hired by rich old men with absolutely no taste.     We watch him bond more than he ever does his own wife! The poor girl. He doesn't see her for three years while working on baths. Definitely the biggest points down for Lucius' character. Dude should learn to take a real day off sometime. And not just the forced-time traveling ones.   I'm getting ahead of myself, but the series ends with Livia reconciling with Lucius after the Roman Emperor Hadrian explains the importance of Lucius's work as an architect. Which... yeah, no. The series has Livia abscond to her parents' house because of how neglectful Lucius is, and even in the manga they divorce (the circumstances of Lucius' remarrying in the manga are hilarious).     In my opinion, he might have a better chance getting it on Emperor Hadrian HIMSELF than winning back the favor of his actual wife after how badly he treated her. Hadrian is actually noted as a pretty good emperor by history standards (a rarity for roman emperors) and the show portrays him as such, and one who deeply cares about trying to keep the empire at peace instead of expanding more territory. But it also notes early on that he was notoriously in love with men, even deifying the young Antinous after he died. So basically, I think Lucius has a chance.     Shout out to Antinous' statue butt!!     Emperor Hadrian having a good head on his shoulders is noted often in the series; the Senate actively plots against him—and by extension Lucius—by virtue of being his favorite architect. Neither of Hadrian's heirs, Ceionus or Marcus Aurelius (seen in the series as a fifteen-year-old boy), are safe from the Senate, hence why Hadrian tasks Lucius with building baths in order to keep the peace.

Re:Dive Season 2 Episode 12  by Richard Eisenbeis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Princess Connect! Re:Dive (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5           This, the final episode of Princess Connect! Re:Dive, is a roller coaster. It's fast-paced, flashy, and hits all the emotional ups and downs you'd expect. It's easy to get caught up in cheering for our heroes in their final battle and feel satisfied at the happy end they've earned.    Pecorine saves the people of Landsol, reunites with her family, and even manages to do it without killing anyone. Kayrl, on the other hand, is able to stand with her new friends, establish the personal connection with Kaiser she's always wanted, and save Kaiser's life—even if that means Kaiser will be imprisoned indefinitely. Lastly, Yuuki is able to do what he wasn't able to do in the previous loop—put it all on the line for his friends and come out victorious. These are all good, solid endings to our heroes and their character arcs—and we even get a ton of extra fanservice as every character we've met so far shows up either in the climax or gets a little epilogue still-frame (or both).    Unfortunately, this episode comes with one major problem—one that has plagued the series as a whole on one level or another: It only really works beyond a surface level if you've played the game. For anime-only viewers, it's got to feel like you're missing major swaths of the story even as the main credits roll. You know that there is some sort of bigger tale going on with Kaiser, Labyrista, and Neneka but nothing about the specifics.    This hurts the anime in a massive way—especially as the series never truly dives into the main villain's motivations. Oh sure, we are told Kaiser is tired from having lived the looping world so many times—and that she hopes to make a utopia. But what does this mean exactly? What is a utopia for Kaiser? Who is the “Minerva” she prays to and what part would Minerva play in all this? And what does pulling Sol Tower down have to do with anything? Heck, beyond the last reset (which was done for Yuuki's sake) we don't even know why loops occur in the first place!    Of course, mentioning important things in passing while never explaining them is hardly new for the show. What are the “Seven Crowns”? What does it mean to be a “Princess Knight”? How/why did Yuuki become Labyrista's? These are important questions and not knowing the answers leaves more than a few holes in this episode's climax.    Overall, the series has tried to make a show that works for both Princess Connect newbies and players of the game—and on some level it has. The emotional character arcs for the Gourmet Guild are well-build and well-defined. We've come to know their goals, motivations, and backstories—and it's easy to root for them. However, the lack of a clear explanation for the setting and the villain's motivations leaves the show with a giant hole in the middle. Though, given that this anime exists largely to get people to play the game, maybe that's the point: “Confused? I guess you'll just have to download the game then, won't you?”    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	We never did find out what the shadow did and what the real kaiser did in the story overall. Oh well!    •	Looking back, it's odd but Kokkoro didn't really get an arc. She was more just the kind, loving, straight-man.    •	I don't know why Little Lyrical of all possible guilds got so much of the spotlight in these final three episodes but the payoff of them getting to do a classic GINAX Pose was well worth it.    •	I loved the effect of Jun's platemail rippling like liquid from Kaiser's attack.    •	If you didn't know that Jun was voiced by Ayako Kawasumi, having her do the classic Fate Stay/night Saber pose probably spelled it out for you.    •	I am shocked that Twinkle Wish did not appear—implying they are well and truly dead. I did not expect that. Knowing that they are dead and not coming back makes Yuuki's depression a few episodes back far more powerful. Unfortunately, at the time, the thought of the original game's three main characters actually being dead was so unbelievable that I rejected the concept outright and all the drama was lost.    •	All in all, this season was much better than I expected it would be. I had a lot of fun writing these reviews and I hope you enjoyed reading them just as much.       Princess Connect! Re:Dive is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

Re:Dive Season 2 Episode 12  by Richard Eisenbeis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Princess Connect! Re:Dive (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5           This, the final episode of Princess Connect! Re:Dive, is a roller coaster. It's fast-paced, flashy, and hits all the emotional ups and downs you'd expect. It's easy to get caught up in cheering for our heroes in their final battle and feel satisfied at the happy end they've earned.    Pecorine saves the people of Landsol, reunites with her family, and even manages to do it without killing anyone. Kayrl, on the other hand, is able to stand with her new friends, establish the personal connection with Kaiser she's always wanted, and save Kaiser's life—even if that means Kaiser will be imprisoned indefinitely. Lastly, Yuuki is able to do what he wasn't able to do in the previous loop—put it all on the line for his friends and come out victorious. These are all good, solid endings to our heroes and their character arcs—and we even get a ton of extra fanservice as every character we've met so far shows up either in the climax or gets a little epilogue still-frame (or both).    Unfortunately, this episode comes with one major problem—one that has plagued the series as a whole on one level or another: It only really works beyond a surface level if you've played the game. For anime-only viewers, it's got to feel like you're missing major swaths of the story even as the main credits roll. You know that there is some sort of bigger tale going on with Kaiser, Labyrista, and Neneka but nothing about the specifics.    This hurts the anime in a massive way—especially as the series never truly dives into the main villain's motivations. Oh sure, we are told Kaiser is tired from having lived the looping world so many times—and that she hopes to make a utopia. But what does this mean exactly? What is a utopia for Kaiser? Who is the “Minerva” she prays to and what part would Minerva play in all this? And what does pulling Sol Tower down have to do with anything? Heck, beyond the last reset (which was done for Yuuki's sake) we don't even know why loops occur in the first place!    Of course, mentioning important things in passing while never explaining them is hardly new for the show. What are the “Seven Crowns”? What does it mean to be a “Princess Knight”? How/why did Yuuki become Labyrista's? These are important questions and not knowing the answers leaves more than a few holes in this episode's climax.    Overall, the series has tried to make a show that works for both Princess Connect newbies and players of the game—and on some level it has. The emotional character arcs for the Gourmet Guild are well-build and well-defined. We've come to know their goals, motivations, and backstories—and it's easy to root for them. However, the lack of a clear explanation for the setting and the villain's motivations leaves the show with a giant hole in the middle. Though, given that this anime exists largely to get people to play the game, maybe that's the point: “Confused? I guess you'll just have to download the game then, won't you?”    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	We never did find out what the shadow did and what the real kaiser did in the story overall. Oh well!    •	Looking back, it's odd but Kokkoro didn't really get an arc. She was more just the kind, loving, straight-man.    •	I don't know why Little Lyrical of all possible guilds got so much of the spotlight in these final three episodes but the payoff of them getting to do a classic GINAX Pose was well worth it.    •	I loved the effect of Jun's platemail rippling like liquid from Kaiser's attack.    •	If you didn't know that Jun was voiced by Ayako Kawasumi, having her do the classic Fate Stay/night Saber pose probably spelled it out for you.    •	I am shocked that Twinkle Wish did not appear—implying they are well and truly dead. I did not expect that. Knowing that they are dead and not coming back makes Yuuki's depression a few episodes back far more powerful. Unfortunately, at the time, the thought of the original game's three main characters actually being dead was so unbelievable that I rejected the concept outright and all the drama was lost.    •	All in all, this season was much better than I expected it would be. I had a lot of fun writing these reviews and I hope you enjoyed reading them just as much.       Princess Connect! Re:Dive is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

Re:Dive Season 2 Episode 12  by Richard Eisenbeis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Princess Connect! Re:Dive (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5           This, the final episode of Princess Connect! Re:Dive, is a roller coaster. It's fast-paced, flashy, and hits all the emotional ups and downs you'd expect. It's easy to get caught up in cheering for our heroes in their final battle and feel satisfied at the happy end they've earned.    Pecorine saves the people of Landsol, reunites with her family, and even manages to do it without killing anyone. Kayrl, on the other hand, is able to stand with her new friends, establish the personal connection with Kaiser she's always wanted, and save Kaiser's life—even if that means Kaiser will be imprisoned indefinitely. Lastly, Yuuki is able to do what he wasn't able to do in the previous loop—put it all on the line for his friends and come out victorious. These are all good, solid endings to our heroes and their character arcs—and we even get a ton of extra fanservice as every character we've met so far shows up either in the climax or gets a little epilogue still-frame (or both).    Unfortunately, this episode comes with one major problem—one that has plagued the series as a whole on one level or another: It only really works beyond a surface level if you've played the game. For anime-only viewers, it's got to feel like you're missing major swaths of the story even as the main credits roll. You know that there is some sort of bigger tale going on with Kaiser, Labyrista, and Neneka but nothing about the specifics.    This hurts the anime in a massive way—especially as the series never truly dives into the main villain's motivations. Oh sure, we are told Kaiser is tired from having lived the looping world so many times—and that she hopes to make a utopia. But what does this mean exactly? What is a utopia for Kaiser? Who is the “Minerva” she prays to and what part would Minerva play in all this? And what does pulling Sol Tower down have to do with anything? Heck, beyond the last reset (which was done for Yuuki's sake) we don't even know why loops occur in the first place!    Of course, mentioning important things in passing while never explaining them is hardly new for the show. What are the “Seven Crowns”? What does it mean to be a “Princess Knight”? How/why did Yuuki become Labyrista's? These are important questions and not knowing the answers leaves more than a few holes in this episode's climax.    Overall, the series has tried to make a show that works for both Princess Connect newbies and players of the game—and on some level it has. The emotional character arcs for the Gourmet Guild are well-build and well-defined. We've come to know their goals, motivations, and backstories—and it's easy to root for them. However, the lack of a clear explanation for the setting and the villain's motivations leaves the show with a giant hole in the middle. Though, given that this anime exists largely to get people to play the game, maybe that's the point: “Confused? I guess you'll just have to download the game then, won't you?”    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	We never did find out what the shadow did and what the real kaiser did in the story overall. Oh well!    •	Looking back, it's odd but Kokkoro didn't really get an arc. She was more just the kind, loving, straight-man.    •	I don't know why Little Lyrical of all possible guilds got so much of the spotlight in these final three episodes but the payoff of them getting to do a classic GINAX Pose was well worth it.    •	I loved the effect of Jun's platemail rippling like liquid from Kaiser's attack.    •	If you didn't know that Jun was voiced by Ayako Kawasumi, having her do the classic Fate Stay/night Saber pose probably spelled it out for you.    •	I am shocked that Twinkle Wish did not appear—implying they are well and truly dead. I did not expect that. Knowing that they are dead and not coming back makes Yuuki's depression a few episodes back far more powerful. Unfortunately, at the time, the thought of the original game's three main characters actually being dead was so unbelievable that I rejected the concept outright and all the drama was lost.    •	All in all, this season was much better than I expected it would be. I had a lot of fun writing these reviews and I hope you enjoyed reading them just as much.       Princess Connect! Re:Dive is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

Kayrl, on the other hand, is able to stand with her new friends, establish the personal connection with Kaiser she's always wanted, and save Kaiser's life—even if that means Kaiser will be imprisoned indefinitely. Lastly, Yuuki is able to do what he wasn't able to do in the previous loop—put it all on the line for his friends and come out victorious. These are all good, solid endings to our heroes and their character arcs—and we even get a ton of extra fanservice as every character we've met so far shows up either in the climax or gets a little epilogue still-frame (or both).    Unfortunately, this episode comes with one major problem—one that has plagued the series as a whole on one level or another: It only really works beyond a surface level if you've played the game. For anime-only viewers, it's got to feel like you're missing major swaths of the story even as the main credits roll. You know that there is some sort of bigger tale going on with Kaiser, Labyrista, and Neneka but nothing about the specifics.    This hurts the anime in a massive way—especially as the series never truly dives into the main villain's motivations. Oh sure, we are told Kaiser is tired from having lived the looping world so many times—and that she hopes to make a utopia. But what does this mean exactly? What is a utopia for Kaiser? Who is the “Minerva” she prays to and what part would Minerva play in all this? And what does pulling Sol Tower down have to do with anything? Heck, beyond the last reset (which was done for Yuuki's sake) we don't even know why loops occur in the first place!    Of course, mentioning important things in passing while never explaining them is hardly new for the show. What are the “Seven Crowns”? What does it mean to be a “Princess Knight”? How/why did Yuuki become Labyrista's? These are important questions and not knowing the answers leaves more than a few holes in this episode's climax.    Overall, the series has tried to make a show that works for both Princess Connect newbies and players of the game—and on some level it has. The emotional character arcs for the Gourmet Guild are well-build and well-defined. We've come to know their goals, motivations, and backstories—and it's easy to root for them. However, the lack of a clear explanation for the setting and the villain's motivations leaves the show with a giant hole in the middle. Though, given that this anime exists largely to get people to play the game, maybe that's the point: “Confused? I guess you'll just have to download the game then, won't you?”    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	We never did find out what the shadow did and what the real kaiser did in the story overall. Oh well!    •	Looking back, it's odd but Kokkoro didn't really get an arc. She was more just the kind, loving, straight-man.    •	I don't know why Little Lyrical of all possible guilds got so much of the spotlight in these final three episodes but the payoff of them getting to do a classic GINAX Pose was well worth it.    •	I loved the effect of Jun's platemail rippling like liquid from Kaiser's attack.    •	If you didn't know that Jun was voiced by Ayako Kawasumi, having her do the classic Fate Stay/night Saber pose probably spelled it out for you.    •	I am shocked that Twinkle Wish did not appear—implying they are well and truly dead. I did not expect that. Knowing that they are dead and not coming back makes Yuuki's depression a few episodes back far more powerful. Unfortunately, at the time, the thought of the original game's three main characters actually being dead was so unbelievable that I rejected the concept outright and all the drama was lost.    •	All in all, this season was much better than I expected it would be. I had a lot of fun writing these reviews and I hope you enjoyed reading them just as much.       Princess Connect! Re:Dive is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

She was more just the kind, loving, straight-man.    •	I don't know why Little Lyrical of all possible guilds got so much of the spotlight in these final three episodes but the payoff of them getting to do a classic GINAX Pose was well worth it.    •	I loved the effect of Jun's platemail rippling like liquid from Kaiser's attack.    •	If you didn't know that Jun was voiced by Ayako Kawasumi, having her do the classic Fate Stay/night Saber pose probably spelled it out for you.    •	I am shocked that Twinkle Wish did not appear—implying they are well and truly dead. I did not expect that. Knowing that they are dead and not coming back makes Yuuki's depression a few episodes back far more powerful. Unfortunately, at the time, the thought of the original game's three main characters actually being dead was so unbelievable that I rejected the concept outright and all the drama was lost.    •	All in all, this season was much better than I expected it would be.

Re:Dive Season 2 - Anime News Network:SEA,"             How would you rate episode 12 of Princess Connect! Re:Dive (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5           This, the final episode of Princess Connect! Re:Dive, is a roller coaster. It's fast-paced, flashy, and hits all the emotional ups and downs you'd expect. It's easy to get caught up in cheering for our heroes in their final battle and feel satisfied at the happy end they've earned.    Pecorine saves the people of Landsol, reunites with her family, and even manages to do it without killing anyone. Kayrl, on the other hand, is able to stand with her new friends, establish the personal connection with Kaiser she's always wanted, and save Kaiser's life—even if that means Kaiser will be imprisoned indefinitely. Lastly, Yuuki is able to do what he wasn't able to do in the previous loop—put it all on the line for his friends and come out victorious. These are all good, solid endings to our heroes and their character arcs—and we even get a ton of extra fanservice as every character we've met so far shows up either in the climax or gets a little epilogue still-frame (or both).    Unfortunately, this episode comes with one major problem—one that has plagued the series as a whole on one level or another: It only really works beyond a surface level if you've played the game. For anime-only viewers, it's got to feel like you're missing major swaths of the story even as the main credits roll. You know that there is some sort of bigger tale going on with Kaiser, Labyrista, and Neneka but nothing about the specifics.    This hurts the anime in a massive way—especially as the series never truly dives into the main villain's motivations. Oh sure, we are told Kaiser is tired from having lived the looping world so many times—and that she hopes to make a utopia. But what does this mean exactly? What is a utopia for Kaiser? Who is the “Minerva” she prays to and what part would Minerva play in all this? And what does pulling Sol Tower down have to do with anything? Heck, beyond the last reset (which was done for Yuuki's sake) we don't even know why loops occur in the first place!    Of course, mentioning important things in passing while never explaining them is hardly new for the show. What are the “Seven Crowns”? What does it mean to be a “Princess Knight”? How/why did Yuuki become Labyrista's? These are important questions and not knowing the answers leaves more than a few holes in this episode's climax.    Overall, the series has tried to make a show that works for both Princess Connect newbies and players of the game—and on some level it has. The emotional character arcs for the Gourmet Guild are well-build and well-defined. We've come to know their goals, motivations, and backstories—and it's easy to root for them. However, the lack of a clear explanation for the setting and the villain's motivations leaves the show with a giant hole in the middle. Though, given that this anime exists largely to get people to play the game, maybe that's the point: “Confused? I guess you'll just have to download the game then, won't you?”    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	We never did find out what the shadow did and what the real kaiser did in the story overall.

Tokyo 24th Ward Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Tokyo 24th Ward ?                     Community score: 3.2            I definitely had my concerns going into the finale of Tokyo 24th Ward, not so much with whether it would achieve any measurable quality after all this time on the downtrend, but more on how much it would ask of me, evaluation-wise. I don't think I've made any secret of how exhausting I've come to find this show as its weeks wore on, the series repeatedly detailing its views on a bifurcated political system and me having to regularly re-explain why I thought those articulations were stupid. So here at the end of this excruciating thought exercise, would the series throw out some complex domino-arrangement of a solution to its social struggles that I would then have to extend similar effort in knocking down? The answer turns out to be 'no', thankfully, though I suppose I probably never should have expected so much from this series in the first place.    It's kind of a wonder to watch Tokyo 24th Ward sprint so quickly from its own ambitions at this point that you almost forget it ever had any. Perhaps that was the reason for such an order of operations. As the RGB boys close in on her, Asumi expresses shock, disbelief, that they could seek a third path, a compromise between the binary choices of the trolley problem they'd been presented with. That might ring as a properly true surprise had a teamwork-based fix-everything solution not been shown off for the very first problem she issued to them. Since then the one-or-the-other failures have come about as a result of more complicated plot factors as well as disagreements between the boys themselves, so it only makes sense that the show is able to articulate the possibility of things working out so long as conditions are perfect and people are able to work together. That all sets up for the show's final lesson, by the way, and it really is all we get.    Instead, so much of the episode's time is filled, perhaps appropriately for a big series finale, with spectacle of the more conventional variety. There's a high-speed van race to get the kids to the system so they can have their chat with Asumi. There's a ticking clock in the form of the intensifying protests that Mayor Gori can't quell as 0th hangs outside his office and yells ""Debate me, coward!"". Some of the vehicular CGI in all this action looks a bit skippy, and the character models (especially for faces or any crowd characters who aren't protagonists) are as loose and unchecked as things have been since the beginning of this show. But there are still some fluid segments of stunt-based action, and as long as this show has basically stopped thinking about any of its concepts at this point, I'll respect it for having the graciousness to instead occupy us by showing Shu using rocket-rollerblades to Rider Kick a big rig. Plus I just think it's funny that after all the potential doomsaying about this show's production melting down that was bandied about throughout its run (something I'm as guilty of as anyone else) it's seemingly held together as well as possible here to the end, and it was the writing of this dang thing that ended up being the massive let-down. You never know, I guess.    But the trio does need to get to Asumi eventually, and while the VR cyberscape they occupy for their conversation looks as nice as any of the other nicer parts of this show, the actual content is almost shockingly thin conceptually. Say what you will about the execution of Tokyo 24th Ward's idea, at least it seemed to have ambition, and a smattering of socio-political vocabulary with which to express it. But as with the bleating beat-down the boys gave each other at the climax of last week's episode, the writing has now decided to also cap off the climaxes of its plot in simpler, character-based terms rather than any grand, detailed reform suggestions. Most of what's detailed here is the boys understanding the efforts that Asumi suffered through as proxy for the choices that should be made by humans, and thus resolving to…allow humans to make those choices. Yes, the big compromising solution at the heart of ""KANAE System 2.0"" turns out to be…voting! Regular old democratic voting. They don't even spend any time talking about what kind of systemic overhaul this represents for the people of the 24th Ward, instead resolving with some light platitudes about making sure people choose what's best, then waving goodbye to Asumi's ghost-in-the-machine as they confirm how she was basically the most awesome person ever and they all loved her. Seriously, that's the big triumphant moment of this climax, as all the people around the Ward watching the livestream of RGB hashing things out with the Minority Report Vtuber unilaterally declare how much they love her, and that love is the unifying factor that makes them all abandon those hasty violent reform options in favor of going back to good old voting. Or something.    And that's it! All the wrap-ups that follow are embarrassingly basic, from the show flashing forward to the real-world date it ended on of April 6th, 2022, because that's how clever it thinks it is, to Shantytown getting torn down anyway, but it's okay because in this case it was because of seismic resistance issues. After all its build-up and Big Questions presented by the recurring trolley problem format, the series seems uninterested in provoking answers even from the audience, settling on ""Things aren't perfect, but they'll probably be ok if you just let people figure it out"". It's bizarrely flippant and optimistic for a story that clearly had some understanding of the complex societal factors that led to so many of the ills it was illustrating in the first place. But then, as I said, I almost respect the show more for realizing right at the finish line that it had neither the concept nor ability to waste our time with more complicated, ill-fated illustrative solutions. So that's where it lands: A show that weeks ago was able to make the salient point that crime rates in lower-income areas are an inflated result of various baked-in socioeconomic prejudices, now declares all societal issues solved when we see Shu head-butt a mugger and hand a kid some bread. I guess the only thing that stops a bad guy with a knife is a good guy with a bun.    Rating:                 Tokyo 24th Ward is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

After all its build-up and Big Questions presented by the recurring trolley problem format, the series seems uninterested in provoking answers even from the audience, settling on ""Things aren't perfect, but they'll probably be ok if you just let people figure it out"". It's bizarrely flippant and optimistic for a story that clearly had some understanding of the complex societal factors that led to so many of the ills it was illustrating in the first place. But then, as I said, I almost respect the show more for realizing right at the finish line that it had neither the concept nor ability to waste our time with more complicated, ill-fated illustrative solutions. So that's where it lands: A show that weeks ago was able to make the salient point that crime rates in lower-income areas are an inflated result of various baked-in socioeconomic prejudices, now declares all societal issues solved when we see Shu head-butt a mugger and hand a kid some bread. I guess the only thing that stops a bad guy with a knife is a good guy with a bun.    Rating:                 Tokyo 24th Ward is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

Tokyo 24th Ward Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Tokyo 24th Ward ?                     Community score: 3.2            I definitely had my concerns going into the finale of Tokyo 24th Ward, not so much with whether it would achieve any measurable quality after all this time on the downtrend, but more on how much it would ask of me, evaluation-wise. I don't think I've made any secret of how exhausting I've come to find this show as its weeks wore on, the series repeatedly detailing its views on a bifurcated political system and me having to regularly re-explain why I thought those articulations were stupid. So here at the end of this excruciating thought exercise, would the series throw out some complex domino-arrangement of a solution to its social struggles that I would then have to extend similar effort in knocking down? The answer turns out to be 'no', thankfully, though I suppose I probably never should have expected so much from this series in the first place.    It's kind of a wonder to watch Tokyo 24th Ward sprint so quickly from its own ambitions at this point that you almost forget it ever had any. Perhaps that was the reason for such an order of operations. As the RGB boys close in on her, Asumi expresses shock, disbelief, that they could seek a third path, a compromise between the binary choices of the trolley problem they'd been presented with. That might ring as a properly true surprise had a teamwork-based fix-everything solution not been shown off for the very first problem she issued to them. Since then the one-or-the-other failures have come about as a result of more complicated plot factors as well as disagreements between the boys themselves, so it only makes sense that the show is able to articulate the possibility of things working out so long as conditions are perfect and people are able to work together. That all sets up for the show's final lesson, by the way, and it really is all we get.    Instead, so much of the episode's time is filled, perhaps appropriately for a big series finale, with spectacle of the more conventional variety. There's a high-speed van race to get the kids to the system so they can have their chat with Asumi. There's a ticking clock in the form of the intensifying protests that Mayor Gori can't quell as 0th hangs outside his office and yells ""Debate me, coward!"". Some of the vehicular CGI in all this action looks a bit skippy, and the character models (especially for faces or any crowd characters who aren't protagonists) are as loose and unchecked as things have been since the beginning of this show. But there are still some fluid segments of stunt-based action, and as long as this show has basically stopped thinking about any of its concepts at this point, I'll respect it for having the graciousness to instead occupy us by showing Shu using rocket-rollerblades to Rider Kick a big rig. Plus I just think it's funny that after all the potential doomsaying about this show's production melting down that was bandied about throughout its run (something I'm as guilty of as anyone else) it's seemingly held together as well as possible here to the end, and it was the writing of this dang thing that ended up being the massive let-down. You never know, I guess.    But the trio does need to get to Asumi eventually, and while the VR cyberscape they occupy for their conversation looks as nice as any of the other nicer parts of this show, the actual content is almost shockingly thin conceptually. Say what you will about the execution of Tokyo 24th Ward's idea, at least it seemed to have ambition, and a smattering of socio-political vocabulary with which to express it. But as with the bleating beat-down the boys gave each other at the climax of last week's episode, the writing has now decided to also cap off the climaxes of its plot in simpler, character-based terms rather than any grand, detailed reform suggestions. Most of what's detailed here is the boys understanding the efforts that Asumi suffered through as proxy for the choices that should be made by humans, and thus resolving to…allow humans to make those choices. Yes, the big compromising solution at the heart of ""KANAE System 2.0"" turns out to be…voting! Regular old democratic voting. They don't even spend any time talking about what kind of systemic overhaul this represents for the people of the 24th Ward, instead resolving with some light platitudes about making sure people choose what's best, then waving goodbye to Asumi's ghost-in-the-machine as they confirm how she was basically the most awesome person ever and they all loved her. Seriously, that's the big triumphant moment of this climax, as all the people around the Ward watching the livestream of RGB hashing things out with the Minority Report Vtuber unilaterally declare how much they love her, and that love is the unifying factor that makes them all abandon those hasty violent reform options in favor of going back to good old voting. Or something.    And that's it! All the wrap-ups that follow are embarrassingly basic, from the show flashing forward to the real-world date it ended on of April 6th, 2022, because that's how clever it thinks it is, to Shantytown getting torn down anyway, but it's okay because in this case it was because of seismic resistance issues.

Tokyo 24th Ward Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Tokyo 24th Ward ?                     Community score: 3.2            I definitely had my concerns going into the finale of Tokyo 24th Ward, not so much with whether it would achieve any measurable quality after all this time on the downtrend, but more on how much it would ask of me, evaluation-wise. I don't think I've made any secret of how exhausting I've come to find this show as its weeks wore on, the series repeatedly detailing its views on a bifurcated political system and me having to regularly re-explain why I thought those articulations were stupid. So here at the end of this excruciating thought exercise, would the series throw out some complex domino-arrangement of a solution to its social struggles that I would then have to extend similar effort in knocking down? The answer turns out to be 'no', thankfully, though I suppose I probably never should have expected so much from this series in the first place.    It's kind of a wonder to watch Tokyo 24th Ward sprint so quickly from its own ambitions at this point that you almost forget it ever had any. Perhaps that was the reason for such an order of operations. As the RGB boys close in on her, Asumi expresses shock, disbelief, that they could seek a third path, a compromise between the binary choices of the trolley problem they'd been presented with. That might ring as a properly true surprise had a teamwork-based fix-everything solution not been shown off for the very first problem she issued to them. Since then the one-or-the-other failures have come about as a result of more complicated plot factors as well as disagreements between the boys themselves, so it only makes sense that the show is able to articulate the possibility of things working out so long as conditions are perfect and people are able to work together. That all sets up for the show's final lesson, by the way, and it really is all we get.    Instead, so much of the episode's time is filled, perhaps appropriately for a big series finale, with spectacle of the more conventional variety. There's a high-speed van race to get the kids to the system so they can have their chat with Asumi. There's a ticking clock in the form of the intensifying protests that Mayor Gori can't quell as 0th hangs outside his office and yells ""Debate me, coward!"". Some of the vehicular CGI in all this action looks a bit skippy, and the character models (especially for faces or any crowd characters who aren't protagonists) are as loose and unchecked as things have been since the beginning of this show. But there are still some fluid segments of stunt-based action, and as long as this show has basically stopped thinking about any of its concepts at this point, I'll respect it for having the graciousness to instead occupy us by showing Shu using rocket-rollerblades to Rider Kick a big rig. Plus I just think it's funny that after all the potential doomsaying about this show's production melting down that was bandied about throughout its run (something I'm as guilty of as anyone else) it's seemingly held together as well as possible here to the end, and it was the writing of this dang thing that ended up being the massive let-down. You never know, I guess.    But the trio does need to get to Asumi eventually, and while the VR cyberscape they occupy for their conversation looks as nice as any of the other nicer parts of this show, the actual content is almost shockingly thin conceptually. Say what you will about the execution of Tokyo 24th Ward's idea, at least it seemed to have ambition, and a smattering of socio-political vocabulary with which to express it. But as with the bleating beat-down the boys gave each other at the climax of last week's episode, the writing has now decided to also cap off the climaxes of its plot in simpler, character-based terms rather than any grand, detailed reform suggestions. Most of what's detailed here is the boys understanding the efforts that Asumi suffered through as proxy for the choices that should be made by humans, and thus resolving to…allow humans to make those choices. Yes, the big compromising solution at the heart of ""KANAE System 2.0"" turns out to be…voting! Regular old democratic voting. They don't even spend any time talking about what kind of systemic overhaul this represents for the people of the 24th Ward, instead resolving with some light platitudes about making sure people choose what's best, then waving goodbye to Asumi's ghost-in-the-machine as they confirm how she was basically the most awesome person ever and they all loved her. Seriously, that's the big triumphant moment of this climax, as all the people around the Ward watching the livestream of RGB hashing things out with the Minority Report Vtuber unilaterally declare how much they love her, and that love is the unifying factor that makes them all abandon those hasty violent reform options in favor of going back to good old voting. Or something.    And that's it! All the wrap-ups that follow are embarrassingly basic, from the show flashing forward to the real-world date it ended on of April 6th, 2022, because that's how clever it thinks it is, to Shantytown getting torn down anyway, but it's okay because in this case it was because of seismic resistance issues. After all its build-up and Big Questions presented by the recurring trolley problem format, the series seems uninterested in provoking answers even from the audience, settling on ""Things aren't perfect, but they'll probably be ok if you just let people figure it out"". It's bizarrely flippant and optimistic for a story that clearly had some understanding of the complex societal factors that led to so many of the ills it was illustrating in the first place. But then, as I said, I almost respect the show more for realizing right at the finish line that it had neither the concept nor ability to waste our time with more complicated, ill-fated illustrative solutions. So that's where it lands: A show that weeks ago was able to make the salient point that crime rates in lower-income areas are an inflated result of various baked-in socioeconomic prejudices, now declares all societal issues solved when we see Shu head-butt a mugger and hand a kid some bread. I guess the only thing that stops a bad guy with a knife is a good guy with a bun.    Rating:                 Tokyo 24th Ward is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

News City Hunter Series Gets New Anime Film   posted on 2022-04-08 05:04 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Trailer reveals return of TM Network's original ""Get Wild"" ending theme song    The official Twitter account for the City Hunter franchise announced on Friday that the series is getting a new movie to commemorate the television anime's 35th anniversary. The account began streaming a trailer, which lists the movie as ""coming soon."" The video reveals and previews TM Network's ending theme song ""Get Wild,"" which is the same as the original anime's ending. The video also confirms that Akira Kamiya will return to play Ryo Saeba.      Tsukasa Hojo's City Hunter manga ran from 1985 to 1991 and has 35 volumes. The manga inspired four television anime series, one anime film, and several video and television specials including a 2015 original anime DVD. ADV Films released most of these anime projects in North America. The original anime premiered in April 1987. The City Hunter: Shinjuku Private Eyes anime film opened in Japan in February 2019.    Discotek Media announced its license of the original City Hunter anime projects and the recent City Hunter: Shinjuku Private Eyes film in April 2019. Crunchyroll is streaming the City Hunter television anime series, specials, and films.    Coamix and Imagineer's MangaHot app and website is publishing the City Hunter manga in English.    MangaHot describes the story:  Ryo Saeba, a.k.a. City Hunter. A sweeper who fulfills all his client's needs. He'll do anything from bodyguarding to contract killing, but he'll only take the job if a pretty woman is involved, or the client's sincerity makes his heart tremble. Together with his partner Kaori Makimura, the kid sister of his late best friend, Ryo fights the evil haunting the shadows of the city!!  Jackie Chan starred in a 1993 Hong Kong live-action film that very loosely adapts the original manga. A Korean live-action television series adaptation premiered in 2011, and Hulu streamed this version in the United States. A French live-action film adaptation opened in France on February 2019. A separate Chinese live-action film adaptation has been green-lit in China.

ADV Films released most of these anime projects in North America. The original anime premiered in April 1987. The City Hunter: Shinjuku Private Eyes anime film opened in Japan in February 2019.    Discotek Media announced its license of the original City Hunter anime projects and the recent City Hunter: Shinjuku Private Eyes film in April 2019. Crunchyroll is streaming the City Hunter television anime series, specials, and films.    Coamix and Imagineer's MangaHot app and website is publishing the City Hunter manga in English.    MangaHot describes the story:  Ryo Saeba, a.k.a. City Hunter. A sweeper who fulfills all his client's needs. He'll do anything from bodyguarding to contract killing, but he'll only take the job if a pretty woman is involved, or the client's sincerity makes his heart tremble. Together with his partner Kaori Makimura, the kid sister of his late best friend, Ryo fights the evil haunting the shadows of the city!!  Jackie Chan starred in a 1993 Hong Kong live-action film that very loosely adapts the original manga. A Korean live-action television series adaptation premiered in 2011, and Hulu streamed this version in the United States. A French live-action film adaptation opened in France on February 2019. A separate Chinese live-action film adaptation has been green-lit in China.
