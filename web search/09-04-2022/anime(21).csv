News Crunchyroll to Stream Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth Anime   posted on 2022-04-08 04:12 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Anime premieres in July    Crunchyroll announced on Thursday that it will stream the television anime adaptation of AQUAPLUS' Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth (Utawarerumono: Futari no Hakuoro) game in July in North America, Central America, South America, Europe, Africa, Oceania, the Middle East, and the Commonwealth of Independent States.    The anime premieres in July in Japan.    The cast includes:    Kentarō Tone (replacing the late Keiji Fujiwara) as Oshtor (Haku)   Risa Taneda as Kuon   Chinatsu Akasaki as Anju   Inori Minase as Nekone    Tone previously played Ukon in Utawarerumono: The False Faces.    Kenichi Kawamura (storyboard artist on Utawarerumono: The False Faces) is directing the anime at WHITE FOX. Itsuki Yokoyama (Hina Logic - from Luck & Logic script) is overseeing the series scripts, and Masahiko Nakata (Utawarerumono, Utawarerumono: The False Faces) is the character designer and chief animation director. AQUAPLUS is composing the music.    Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth is the last game in the Utawarerumono trilogy. Atlus describes the story:    Chaos has taken hold of the land in Mask of Truth as a conniving general has unlawfully seized the throne of the mighty Yamato Empire. The only ones that stand in his way are a couple of familiar faces who must rally different kingdoms together and fight against the powerful Imperial army. An 80+ hours long visual novel/SRPG experience awaits as you'll get close with a new cast of colorful characters, fight in numerous exciting engagements with an enhanced battle system, explore intriguing new lands, and more.   The game launched in North America and Europe on the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in September 2017. The game shipped in Japan for PlayStation 3, PS4, and PS Vita in September 2016.    AQUAPLUS released the original Utawarerumono game in 2002 for the PC. The game inspired a 2006 television anime series and a 2009 original video anime series. ADV Films released the television series in North America in 2007, and Funimation has since picked up the North American release rights.    Utawarerumono: Mask of Deception (Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen), the second game in the series, launched in Japan in September 2015.

News Crunchyroll to Stream Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth Anime   posted on 2022-04-08 04:12 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Anime premieres in July    Crunchyroll announced on Thursday that it will stream the television anime adaptation of AQUAPLUS' Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth (Utawarerumono: Futari no Hakuoro) game in July in North America, Central America, South America, Europe, Africa, Oceania, the Middle East, and the Commonwealth of Independent States.    The anime premieres in July in Japan.    The cast includes:    Kentarō Tone (replacing the late Keiji Fujiwara) as Oshtor (Haku)   Risa Taneda as Kuon   Chinatsu Akasaki as Anju   Inori Minase as Nekone    Tone previously played Ukon in Utawarerumono: The False Faces.    Kenichi Kawamura (storyboard artist on Utawarerumono: The False Faces) is directing the anime at WHITE FOX. Itsuki Yokoyama (Hina Logic - from Luck & Logic script) is overseeing the series scripts, and Masahiko Nakata (Utawarerumono, Utawarerumono: The False Faces) is the character designer and chief animation director. AQUAPLUS is composing the music.    Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth is the last game in the Utawarerumono trilogy. Atlus describes the story:    Chaos has taken hold of the land in Mask of Truth as a conniving general has unlawfully seized the throne of the mighty Yamato Empire. The only ones that stand in his way are a couple of familiar faces who must rally different kingdoms together and fight against the powerful Imperial army. An 80+ hours long visual novel/SRPG experience awaits as you'll get close with a new cast of colorful characters, fight in numerous exciting engagements with an enhanced battle system, explore intriguing new lands, and more.   The game launched in North America and Europe on the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in September 2017. The game shipped in Japan for PlayStation 3, PS4, and PS Vita in September 2016.    AQUAPLUS released the original Utawarerumono game in 2002 for the PC. The game inspired a 2006 television anime series and a 2009 original video anime series. ADV Films released the television series in North America in 2007, and Funimation has since picked up the North American release rights.    Utawarerumono: Mask of Deception (Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen), the second game in the series, launched in Japan in September 2015. The game's anime adaptation, Utawarerumono: The False Faces, debuted in October 2015. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Sentai Filmworks released the series on home video.    AQUAPLUS is developing a new game Monochrome Moebius: Toki no Taika to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its Utawarerumono franchise. The game will launch in 2022.

News Crunchyroll to Stream Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth Anime   posted on 2022-04-08 04:12 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Anime premieres in July    Crunchyroll announced on Thursday that it will stream the television anime adaptation of AQUAPLUS' Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth (Utawarerumono: Futari no Hakuoro) game in July in North America, Central America, South America, Europe, Africa, Oceania, the Middle East, and the Commonwealth of Independent States.    The anime premieres in July in Japan.    The cast includes:    Kentarō Tone (replacing the late Keiji Fujiwara) as Oshtor (Haku)   Risa Taneda as Kuon   Chinatsu Akasaki as Anju   Inori Minase as Nekone    Tone previously played Ukon in Utawarerumono: The False Faces.    Kenichi Kawamura (storyboard artist on Utawarerumono: The False Faces) is directing the anime at WHITE FOX. Itsuki Yokoyama (Hina Logic - from Luck & Logic script) is overseeing the series scripts, and Masahiko Nakata (Utawarerumono, Utawarerumono: The False Faces) is the character designer and chief animation director. AQUAPLUS is composing the music.    Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth is the last game in the Utawarerumono trilogy. Atlus describes the story:    Chaos has taken hold of the land in Mask of Truth as a conniving general has unlawfully seized the throne of the mighty Yamato Empire. The only ones that stand in his way are a couple of familiar faces who must rally different kingdoms together and fight against the powerful Imperial army. An 80+ hours long visual novel/SRPG experience awaits as you'll get close with a new cast of colorful characters, fight in numerous exciting engagements with an enhanced battle system, explore intriguing new lands, and more.   The game launched in North America and Europe on the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in September 2017. The game shipped in Japan for PlayStation 3, PS4, and PS Vita in September 2016.    AQUAPLUS released the original Utawarerumono game in 2002 for the PC. The game inspired a 2006 television anime series and a 2009 original video anime series. ADV Films released the television series in North America in 2007, and Funimation has since picked up the North American release rights.    Utawarerumono: Mask of Deception (Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen), the second game in the series, launched in Japan in September 2015. The game's anime adaptation, Utawarerumono: The False Faces, debuted in October 2015. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Sentai Filmworks released the series on home video.    AQUAPLUS is developing a new game Monochrome Moebius: Toki no Taika to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its Utawarerumono franchise. The game will launch in 2022.

The game's anime adaptation, Utawarerumono: The False Faces, debuted in October 2015. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Sentai Filmworks released the series on home video.    AQUAPLUS is developing a new game Monochrome Moebius: Toki no Taika to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its Utawarerumono franchise. The game will launch in 2022.

GN 1                      Synopsis:             Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?      Review:         Synopsis:        Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?     Review:            It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise. When a story about a blossoming romance between two characters starts with one of them very directly taking advantage of the other, it has to do a lot of legwork to dig itself out of that hole. Handle that poorly and readers may be left wondering why they should root for these characters by the second chapter. While I don't think that all of the legwork was achieved in this first volume, I was nevertheless surprised at just how subtle yet involved the series is in raising some rather realistic questions about non-heteronormative sexual orientations and how society views them.    A lot of this doesn't come from our main character Chiyo (though there is some bicuriosity starting to bloom there) but rather from the landlord that is placing her in this situation. Despite being younger, there is a clear power imbalance between the two characters and the manga very much treads the line of making sure that the situation doesn't come across as too malicious. A lot of the “favors” being requested range from the mundane to the surprisingly wholesome, and you do get a strong feeling that the landlord isn't going into this arrangement with sex as the primary goal. The manga goes out of its way to highlight that Chiyo's landlord is simply feeling very lonely and a lot of this is borne out of her desperation to fill the void. It is honestly rather refreshing to have a female character that is so blunt about only being into women, but what I found just as fascinating was the occasional snide comment about other sexualities and how people view her.    The manga does not spell out everything for the reader which I appreciate. You get the sense that this was written for an audience that is willing to look past the uncomfortable premise to see where the story actually goes, and what you'll discover beneath that facade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society where their attractions are frowned upon, as well as what it's like to live through a world of microaggressions from people that probably didn't mean to be hurtful but still end up accomplishing just that. That said, I personally think that there are certain lines that should never be crossed regardless of circumstance, and this landlord crossed at least two of them throughout this first volume alone. But surprisingly, I didn't walk away thinking that she was a terrible person, but rather a lonely and misguided soul, which is an accomplishment given my trepidations about the material. If anything, I am interested in seeing where this story goes and if it can pull off the difficult task of having me fully buy into this developing relationship.    However, while I appreciate how the landlord's character is written as she is far and away the most interesting thing about this manga, I can't say the same about our actual named protagonist. She is very much the typical wide-eyed screw-up manga lead that is comedically incapable of taking care of herself despite being the oldest of the two. She definitely means well, and she is willing to step outside her comfort zone for the sake of making up for her own shortcomings, which is endearing. However, the jokes about her incompetence could get a little tiring towards the end. There's nothing necessarily wrong with her character; it's just that this first volume was a little lopsided in its characterization – the bulk of that very subtle character-building went to the landlord whereas Chiyo is clearly meant to counterbalance that as a source of levity. Still, I think that levity could have had more variety towards the end. There are hints towards the end that imply something deeper is beginning to develop – and I hope that goes somewhere – but aside from that, there's just not a lot to Chiyo in this first volume.    Repressed sexuality and sexual desire, non-heterosexual curiosity, societal commentary on different types of sexual orientation – I must admit, none of these are things I was expecting this manga to really touch upon when I originally picked it up to review. While it's impossible to resolve such heavy issues within a single 188-page volume, the fact that there is a clear setup for the story to explore them more deeply made me look at the volume in a more favorable light than I initially had. It is uncomfortable and as I alluded to before, ethical lines like consent or subtle manipulation are muddied more than I think the story really needed to. Unlike the larger societal issues, these more interpersonal dynamics are not treated with the seriousness they deserve, being accompanied by an overall lighter, almost comedic tone. Sometimes it's a nice blend, but mostly they feel incongruous with the at times cartoonish sense of humor the manga has.    This could also be a stylistic issue as the manga will occasionally use simplified character expressions for the sake of brevity. Things like Chiyo's rounded, airheaded expressions are nice and it's not like the art tries too hard to be cute or funny. However, similar to Chiyo's characterization, these don't have a lot of variety to them. That's not true for the whole manga as there are plenty of other instances where the paneling and character framing are being used in subtle ways to elevate the heavier moments. But whenever the style shifts away from that, it can sometimes get jarring and even disappointing to see engaging artwork being undercut by something more typical and repetitive. I hope the balance is improved in future columes.    All in all I Can't Believe I Slept With You! left me pleasantly surprised. It could be because my expectations weren't exactly positive going in, but I do think there are some genuine attempts at leveraging that initial discomfort to talk about some pretty relevant stuff. The mileage on whether or not those conversation starters are worth the shiftier implications of some of our characters' actions will vary from person to person. For me personally though, I think it's a step in the right direction and while I'm not sure if the story will fully redeem itself from the place where it starts, there is enough competency and thoughtfulness on display here that at the very least makes me believe there's a chance that might happen. Guess the manga is forcing me to check out the other volumes to see if my assumptions were right.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B  + A morally questionable lead that's able to generate a surprising amount of sympathy, subtle yet relevant social commentary on sexuality and loneliness − Not much to Chiyo's character for most of the book, humor lacks variety and can clash with more serious moments            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Miyako Miyahara   Full encyclopedia details aboutI Can't Believe I Slept With You!

GN 1                      Synopsis:             Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?      Review:         Synopsis:        Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?     Review:            It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise. When a story about a blossoming romance between two characters starts with one of them very directly taking advantage of the other, it has to do a lot of legwork to dig itself out of that hole. Handle that poorly and readers may be left wondering why they should root for these characters by the second chapter. While I don't think that all of the legwork was achieved in this first volume, I was nevertheless surprised at just how subtle yet involved the series is in raising some rather realistic questions about non-heteronormative sexual orientations and how society views them.    A lot of this doesn't come from our main character Chiyo (though there is some bicuriosity starting to bloom there) but rather from the landlord that is placing her in this situation. Despite being younger, there is a clear power imbalance between the two characters and the manga very much treads the line of making sure that the situation doesn't come across as too malicious. A lot of the “favors” being requested range from the mundane to the surprisingly wholesome, and you do get a strong feeling that the landlord isn't going into this arrangement with sex as the primary goal. The manga goes out of its way to highlight that Chiyo's landlord is simply feeling very lonely and a lot of this is borne out of her desperation to fill the void. It is honestly rather refreshing to have a female character that is so blunt about only being into women, but what I found just as fascinating was the occasional snide comment about other sexualities and how people view her.    The manga does not spell out everything for the reader which I appreciate. You get the sense that this was written for an audience that is willing to look past the uncomfortable premise to see where the story actually goes, and what you'll discover beneath that facade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society where their attractions are frowned upon, as well as what it's like to live through a world of microaggressions from people that probably didn't mean to be hurtful but still end up accomplishing just that. That said, I personally think that there are certain lines that should never be crossed regardless of circumstance, and this landlord crossed at least two of them throughout this first volume alone. But surprisingly, I didn't walk away thinking that she was a terrible person, but rather a lonely and misguided soul, which is an accomplishment given my trepidations about the material. If anything, I am interested in seeing where this story goes and if it can pull off the difficult task of having me fully buy into this developing relationship.    However, while I appreciate how the landlord's character is written as she is far and away the most interesting thing about this manga, I can't say the same about our actual named protagonist. She is very much the typical wide-eyed screw-up manga lead that is comedically incapable of taking care of herself despite being the oldest of the two. She definitely means well, and she is willing to step outside her comfort zone for the sake of making up for her own shortcomings, which is endearing. However, the jokes about her incompetence could get a little tiring towards the end. There's nothing necessarily wrong with her character; it's just that this first volume was a little lopsided in its characterization – the bulk of that very subtle character-building went to the landlord whereas Chiyo is clearly meant to counterbalance that as a source of levity. Still, I think that levity could have had more variety towards the end. There are hints towards the end that imply something deeper is beginning to develop – and I hope that goes somewhere – but aside from that, there's just not a lot to Chiyo in this first volume.    Repressed sexuality and sexual desire, non-heterosexual curiosity, societal commentary on different types of sexual orientation – I must admit, none of these are things I was expecting this manga to really touch upon when I originally picked it up to review. While it's impossible to resolve such heavy issues within a single 188-page volume, the fact that there is a clear setup for the story to explore them more deeply made me look at the volume in a more favorable light than I initially had. It is uncomfortable and as I alluded to before, ethical lines like consent or subtle manipulation are muddied more than I think the story really needed to. Unlike the larger societal issues, these more interpersonal dynamics are not treated with the seriousness they deserve, being accompanied by an overall lighter, almost comedic tone. Sometimes it's a nice blend, but mostly they feel incongruous with the at times cartoonish sense of humor the manga has.    This could also be a stylistic issue as the manga will occasionally use simplified character expressions for the sake of brevity. Things like Chiyo's rounded, airheaded expressions are nice and it's not like the art tries too hard to be cute or funny. However, similar to Chiyo's characterization, these don't have a lot of variety to them. That's not true for the whole manga as there are plenty of other instances where the paneling and character framing are being used in subtle ways to elevate the heavier moments. But whenever the style shifts away from that, it can sometimes get jarring and even disappointing to see engaging artwork being undercut by something more typical and repetitive. I hope the balance is improved in future columes.    All in all I Can't Believe I Slept With You! left me pleasantly surprised. It could be because my expectations weren't exactly positive going in, but I do think there are some genuine attempts at leveraging that initial discomfort to talk about some pretty relevant stuff. The mileage on whether or not those conversation starters are worth the shiftier implications of some of our characters' actions will vary from person to person. For me personally though, I think it's a step in the right direction and while I'm not sure if the story will fully redeem itself from the place where it starts, there is enough competency and thoughtfulness on display here that at the very least makes me believe there's a chance that might happen. Guess the manga is forcing me to check out the other volumes to see if my assumptions were right.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B  + A morally questionable lead that's able to generate a surprising amount of sympathy, subtle yet relevant social commentary on sexuality and loneliness − Not much to Chiyo's character for most of the book, humor lacks variety and can clash with more serious moments            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Miyako Miyahara   Full encyclopedia details aboutI Can't Believe I Slept With You!

Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?     Review:            It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise. When a story about a blossoming romance between two characters starts with one of them very directly taking advantage of the other, it has to do a lot of legwork to dig itself out of that hole. Handle that poorly and readers may be left wondering why they should root for these characters by the second chapter. While I don't think that all of the legwork was achieved in this first volume, I was nevertheless surprised at just how subtle yet involved the series is in raising some rather realistic questions about non-heteronormative sexual orientations and how society views them.    A lot of this doesn't come from our main character Chiyo (though there is some bicuriosity starting to bloom there) but rather from the landlord that is placing her in this situation. Despite being younger, there is a clear power imbalance between the two characters and the manga very much treads the line of making sure that the situation doesn't come across as too malicious. A lot of the “favors” being requested range from the mundane to the surprisingly wholesome, and you do get a strong feeling that the landlord isn't going into this arrangement with sex as the primary goal. The manga goes out of its way to highlight that Chiyo's landlord is simply feeling very lonely and a lot of this is borne out of her desperation to fill the void. It is honestly rather refreshing to have a female character that is so blunt about only being into women, but what I found just as fascinating was the occasional snide comment about other sexualities and how people view her.    The manga does not spell out everything for the reader which I appreciate. You get the sense that this was written for an audience that is willing to look past the uncomfortable premise to see where the story actually goes, and what you'll discover beneath that facade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society where their attractions are frowned upon, as well as what it's like to live through a world of microaggressions from people that probably didn't mean to be hurtful but still end up accomplishing just that. That said, I personally think that there are certain lines that should never be crossed regardless of circumstance, and this landlord crossed at least two of them throughout this first volume alone. But surprisingly, I didn't walk away thinking that she was a terrible person, but rather a lonely and misguided soul, which is an accomplishment given my trepidations about the material. If anything, I am interested in seeing where this story goes and if it can pull off the difficult task of having me fully buy into this developing relationship.    However, while I appreciate how the landlord's character is written as she is far and away the most interesting thing about this manga, I can't say the same about our actual named protagonist. She is very much the typical wide-eyed screw-up manga lead that is comedically incapable of taking care of herself despite being the oldest of the two. She definitely means well, and she is willing to step outside her comfort zone for the sake of making up for her own shortcomings, which is endearing. However, the jokes about her incompetence could get a little tiring towards the end. There's nothing necessarily wrong with her character; it's just that this first volume was a little lopsided in its characterization – the bulk of that very subtle character-building went to the landlord whereas Chiyo is clearly meant to counterbalance that as a source of levity. Still, I think that levity could have had more variety towards the end. There are hints towards the end that imply something deeper is beginning to develop – and I hope that goes somewhere – but aside from that, there's just not a lot to Chiyo in this first volume.    Repressed sexuality and sexual desire, non-heterosexual curiosity, societal commentary on different types of sexual orientation – I must admit, none of these are things I was expecting this manga to really touch upon when I originally picked it up to review. While it's impossible to resolve such heavy issues within a single 188-page volume, the fact that there is a clear setup for the story to explore them more deeply made me look at the volume in a more favorable light than I initially had. It is uncomfortable and as I alluded to before, ethical lines like consent or subtle manipulation are muddied more than I think the story really needed to. Unlike the larger societal issues, these more interpersonal dynamics are not treated with the seriousness they deserve, being accompanied by an overall lighter, almost comedic tone. Sometimes it's a nice blend, but mostly they feel incongruous with the at times cartoonish sense of humor the manga has.    This could also be a stylistic issue as the manga will occasionally use simplified character expressions for the sake of brevity. Things like Chiyo's rounded, airheaded expressions are nice and it's not like the art tries too hard to be cute or funny. However, similar to Chiyo's characterization, these don't have a lot of variety to them. That's not true for the whole manga as there are plenty of other instances where the paneling and character framing are being used in subtle ways to elevate the heavier moments. But whenever the style shifts away from that, it can sometimes get jarring and even disappointing to see engaging artwork being undercut by something more typical and repetitive. I hope the balance is improved in future columes.    All in all I Can't Believe I Slept With You! left me pleasantly surprised. It could be because my expectations weren't exactly positive going in, but I do think there are some genuine attempts at leveraging that initial discomfort to talk about some pretty relevant stuff. The mileage on whether or not those conversation starters are worth the shiftier implications of some of our characters' actions will vary from person to person. For me personally though, I think it's a step in the right direction and while I'm not sure if the story will fully redeem itself from the place where it starts, there is enough competency and thoughtfulness on display here that at the very least makes me believe there's a chance that might happen. Guess the manga is forcing me to check out the other volumes to see if my assumptions were right.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B  + A morally questionable lead that's able to generate a surprising amount of sympathy, subtle yet relevant social commentary on sexuality and loneliness − Not much to Chiyo's character for most of the book, humor lacks variety and can clash with more serious moments            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Miyako Miyahara   Full encyclopedia details aboutI Can't Believe I Slept With You!

The Funimation name is being pretty much done away with entirely. Even the new ADR studio building Funimation has been slowly moving into the past couple years or so recently changed all the branding/signage in the building to include more orange and use ""Crunchyroll.""   I 100% get why a parent company would want everything under one name and given its international name recognition there's no reason it shouldn't be CR. But I can't lie, it is a little sad considering how longstanding the Funimation name has been since the 90s. One of the few to survive the worst years of the anime industry. Obviously there are bigger issues at hand, especially regarding employees actually working for/contracted with CR, but I can't deny it's sad to see even the ADR studio as a whole lose the name.   I'm not saying Funimation as studio was perfect (I don't think any studio could be with that high an output, especially a non-union one with tiered rates which is most anime-focused studios) but they spent decades and resources into maintaining a dub audience. Also steadily improving upon their work by establishing certain standards, finally changing directors and writers into salaried positions, and not treating said audience like an afterthought even with streaming becoming more the norm over home releases.    To see that name being replaced specifically when it comes to dubs by a company who has shown for years that they couldn't really give a crap about that audience (rarely dubbing outside a specific genre/targeted demographic, very poor promotion if its there at all, barely crediting anyone aside from leads, even most articles highlighting CR-exclusive dubs were bait-y as hell, etc...), yeah it is a bit sad in a way I don't think most people who aren't mindful of that side of the industry really get.    But at the end of the day, it's business, and there are more important matters for audiences to encourage some actual change that actually matters and for the first time in a long time feels like it's possible.

Totally agree.  I get that it's a branding thing, but my first thought seeing this was, ""Uh, no those are Funimation dubs.""  Especially since it was on Funimation's youtube channel, so Crunchyroll had nothing to do with it.  It's kind of weird to see how a company that could come through those collapse years better than any of the competition could just sort of disappear rather unceremoniously when the decision comes down.

Have I mentioned I hate Crunchyroll lately? I have? Too bad, they're still hot garbage.   Funimation succeeded itself into non existence.            Just thought I'd point out that ""Dubbed"" in this context can only be read as a verb in the past tense, while ""Dubs"" can be read either as a noun, verb, or an adjective. If you don't like something, that's fine. But when it starts warping your perception and you start forcing reasons to be upset where they don't exist, you may need to take a step back.

As much as I absolutely hate this merger, at the very least the FUNimation name should have stuck for home video. You can have the streaming service and the home video publisher be named differently. Sentai Filmworks has made that work with The Anime Network, later HIDIVE, with ads for said streaming services on the disc startups.   On another note, even the ADV Films name has managed to stick around more than 12 years after the restructure. ADV's 30th birthday is this August. There's currently 3 in-print Blu-rays with their logo on it: Elfen Lied, Kino's Journey, and Lady Death: The Motion Picture      Back to top                     Mirko The Bunny Gamer    Joined: 17 Mar 2022 		    Posts: 11       Posted: Thu Apr 07, 2022 10:56 pm              Greed1914 wrote:       KitKat1721 wrote:    Not surprised at all.

Totally agree.  I get that it's a branding thing, but my first thought seeing this was, ""Uh, no those are Funimation dubs.""  Especially since it was on Funimation's youtube channel, so Crunchyroll had nothing to do with it.  It's kind of weird to see how a company that could come through those collapse years better than any of the competition could just sort of disappear rather unceremoniously when the decision comes down.            yeah that's my issue here too..it really comes off as trying to take credit for what funimation's done when crunchyroll had nothing to do with it   they simply absorbed funimation and it was rebranded as another division of crunchyroll...   I Can't see MHA As A CR Dub because it was done by funimation and will continue to be done by funimation no matter what anyone tells me   rebranding it ""CR Dubs"" doesn't mean crunchyroll dubbed them      Back to top                  Gemnist    Joined: 10 Feb 2016 		    Posts: 1684       Posted: Thu Apr 07, 2022 11:55 pm            Focusing on dubs is a pretty logical step, and it's good to see the channel won't be deleted since that's where I get my daily Unravel fix.   Guess the big question now is what will happen to home media (they could reasonably keep it open since Crunchyroll doesn't have its own home media service like Funimation).

It's kind of weird to see how a company that could come through those collapse years better than any of the competition could just sort of disappear rather unceremoniously when the decision comes down.

I 100% get why a parent company would want everything under one name and given its international name recognition there's no reason it shouldn't be CR. But I can't lie, it is a little sad considering how longstanding the Funimation name has been since the 90s. One of the few to survive the worst years of the anime industry. Obviously there are bigger issues at hand, especially regarding employees actually working for/contracted with CR, but I can't deny it's sad to see even the ADR studio as a whole lose the name.   I'm not saying Funimation as studio was perfect (I don't think any studio could be with that high an output, especially a non-union one with tiered rates which is most anime-focused studios) but they spent decades and resources into maintaining a dub audience. Also steadily improving upon their work by establishing certain standards, finally changing directors and writers into salaried positions, and not treating said audience like an afterthought even with streaming becoming more the norm over home releases.    To see that name being replaced specifically when it comes to dubs by a company who has shown for years that they couldn't really give a crap about that audience (rarely dubbing outside a specific genre/targeted demographic, very poor promotion if its there at all, barely crediting anyone aside from leads, even most articles highlighting CR-exclusive dubs were bait-y as hell, etc...), yeah it is a bit sad in a way I don't think most people who aren't mindful of that side of the industry really get.    But at the end of the day, it's business, and there are more important matters for audiences to encourage some actual change that actually matters and for the first time in a long time feels like it's possible.            I also agree with what you had to say. Regardless, hopefully things will continue to work out in regards to the dubs and home video release.

Just thought I'd point out that ""Dubbed"" in this context can only be read as a verb in the past tense, while ""Dubs"" can be read either as a noun, verb, or an adjective. If you don't like something, that's fine. But when it starts warping your perception and you start forcing reasons to be upset where they don't exist, you may need to take a step back.

As much as I absolutely hate this merger, at the very least the FUNimation name should have stuck for home video. You can have the streaming service and the home video publisher be named differently. Sentai Filmworks has made that work with The Anime Network, later HIDIVE, with ads for said streaming services on the disc startups.   On another note, even the ADV Films name has managed to stick around more than 12 years after the restructure. ADV's 30th birthday is this August.

Especially since it was on Funimation's youtube channel, so Crunchyroll had nothing to do with it.  It's kind of weird to see how a company that could come through those collapse years better than any of the competition could just sort of disappear rather unceremoniously when the decision comes down.

Just thought I'd point out that ""Dubbed"" in this context can only be read as a verb in the past tense, while ""Dubs"" can be read either as a noun, verb, or an adjective. If you don't like something, that's fine. But when it starts warping your perception and you start forcing reasons to be upset where they don't exist, you may need to take a step back.

As much as I absolutely hate this merger, at the very least the FUNimation name should have stuck for home video. You can have the streaming service and the home video publisher be named differently. Sentai Filmworks has made that work with The Anime Network, later HIDIVE, with ads for said streaming services on the disc startups.   On another note, even the ADV Films name has managed to stick around more than 12 years after the restructure. ADV's 30th birthday is this August.

Just thought I'd point out that ""Dubbed"" in this context can only be read as a verb in the past tense, while ""Dubs"" can be read either as a noun, verb, or an adjective. If you don't like something, that's fine. But when it starts warping your perception and you start forcing reasons to be upset where they don't exist, you may need to take a step back.

As much as I absolutely hate this merger, at the very least the FUNimation name should have stuck for home video. You can have the streaming service and the home video publisher be named differently. Sentai Filmworks has made that work with The Anime Network, later HIDIVE, with ads for said streaming services on the disc startups.   On another note, even the ADV Films name has managed to stick around more than 12 years after the restructure. ADV's 30th birthday is this August.

Just thought I'd point out that ""Dubbed"" in this context can only be read as a verb in the past tense, while ""Dubs"" can be read either as a noun, verb, or an adjective. If you don't like something, that's fine. But when it starts warping your perception and you start forcing reasons to be upset where they don't exist, you may need to take a step back.

As much as I absolutely hate this merger, at the very least the FUNimation name should have stuck for home video. You can have the streaming service and the home video publisher be named differently. Sentai Filmworks has made that work with The Anime Network, later HIDIVE, with ads for said streaming services on the disc startups.   On another note, even the ADV Films name has managed to stick around more than 12 years after the restructure. ADV's 30th birthday is this August.

I'm not saying Funimation as studio was perfect (I don't think any studio could be with that high an output, especially a non-union one with tiered rates which is most anime-focused studios) but they spent decades and resources into maintaining a dub audience. Also steadily improving upon their work by establishing certain standards, finally changing directors and writers into salaried positions, and not treating said audience like an afterthought even with streaming becoming more the norm over home releases.    To see that name being replaced specifically when it comes to dubs by a company who has shown for years that they couldn't really give a crap about that audience (rarely dubbing outside a specific genre/targeted demographic, very poor promotion if its there at all, barely crediting anyone aside from leads, even most articles highlighting CR-exclusive dubs were bait-y as hell, etc...), yeah it is a bit sad in a way I don't think most people who aren't mindful of that side of the industry really get.    But at the end of the day, it's business, and there are more important matters for audiences to encourage some actual change that actually matters and for the first time in a long time feels like it's possible.

To see that name being replaced specifically when it comes to dubs by a company who has shown for years that they couldn't really give a crap about that audience (rarely dubbing outside a specific genre/targeted demographic, very poor promotion if its there at all, barely crediting anyone aside from leads, even most articles highlighting CR-exclusive dubs were bait-y as hell, etc...), yeah it is a bit sad in a way I don't think most people who aren't mindful of that side of the industry really get.    But at the end of the day, it's business, and there are more important matters for audiences to encourage some actual change that actually matters and for the first time in a long time feels like it's possible.            Totally agree.  I get that it's a branding thing, but my first thought seeing this was, ""Uh, no those are Funimation dubs.""  Especially since it was on Funimation's youtube channel, so Crunchyroll had nothing to do with it.  It's kind of weird to see how a company that could come through those collapse years better than any of the competition could just sort of disappear rather unceremoniously when the decision comes down.            yeah that's my issue here too..it really comes off as trying to take credit for what funimation's done when crunchyroll had nothing to do with it   they simply absorbed funimation and it was rebranded as another division of crunchyroll...   I Can't see MHA As A CR Dub because it was done by funimation and will continue to be done by funimation no matter what anyone tells me   rebranding it ""CR Dubs"" doesn't mean crunchyroll dubbed them      Back to top                  Gemnist    Joined: 10 Feb 2016 		    Posts: 1684       Posted: Thu Apr 07, 2022 11:55 pm            Focusing on dubs is a pretty logical step, and it's good to see the channel won't be deleted since that's where I get my daily Unravel fix.   Guess the big question now is what will happen to home media (they could reasonably keep it open since Crunchyroll doesn't have its own home media service like Funimation).

Just thought I'd point out that ""Dubbed"" in this context can only be read as a verb in the past tense, while ""Dubs"" can be read either as a noun, verb, or an adjective. If you don't like something, that's fine. But when it starts warping your perception and you start forcing reasons to be upset where they don't exist, you may need to take a step back.

As much as I absolutely hate this merger, at the very least the FUNimation name should have stuck for home video. You can have the streaming service and the home video publisher be named differently. Sentai Filmworks has made that work with The Anime Network, later HIDIVE, with ads for said streaming services on the disc startups.   On another note, even the ADV Films name has managed to stick around more than 12 years after the restructure. ADV's 30th birthday is this August.

Have I mentioned I hate Crunchyroll lately? I have? Too bad, they're still hot garbage.   Funimation succeeded itself into non existence.

Just thought I'd point out that ""Dubbed"" in this context can only be read as a verb in the past tense, while ""Dubs"" can be read either as a noun, verb, or an adjective. If you don't like something, that's fine. But when it starts warping your perception and you start forcing reasons to be upset where they don't exist, you may need to take a step back.

As much as I absolutely hate this merger, at the very least the FUNimation name should have stuck for home video. You can have the streaming service and the home video publisher be named differently. Sentai Filmworks has made that work with The Anime Network, later HIDIVE, with ads for said streaming services on the disc startups.   On another note, even the ADV Films name has managed to stick around more than 12 years after the restructure. ADV's 30th birthday is this August. There's currently 3 in-print Blu-rays with their logo on it: Elfen Lied, Kino's Journey, and Lady Death: The Motion Picture      Back to top                     Mirko The Bunny Gamer    Joined: 17 Mar 2022 		    Posts: 11       Posted: Thu Apr 07, 2022 10:56 pm              Greed1914 wrote:       KitKat1721 wrote:    Not surprised at all.

REVIEW: Tokyo 24th Ward             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        Spider3PO    Joined: 08 Jan 2022 		    Posts: 16       Posted: Thu Jan 20, 2022 3:55 pm            A fair review. I enjoyed ep 1 & 2. But with 3, that tornado was left field. I didn't like that twist.   They had already started foreshadowing two different groups as being shady. And neither of them played into being at the heart of the crisis this week. Not even the group that tried to cheat.   It's as if the showrunner thought a unexpected plot twist was more important then putting in the work via foreshadowing to make it a meaningful payoff. Just to subvert expectations on what the crisis was going to be. It bugs me.    Unless there was some clue I missed in 2 & 3 to suggest a natural disaster was coming this episode? Cause I don't remember anything like that.

I don't know, everywhere? This is an A++ series for me but I don't even know where to begin in explaining how great I think it is...   Yes, you picked up on the Trolley one and the show pointed it out but the second chaos point was centered around... political ideals of all things, the Libertarian versus the Liberal. Survival of the fittest versus protecting the weak. ""Taking the third option"" in the Trolley problem is par for the course but it's a lot more nuanced when it comes to politics built into your blood.    It's not ""working together"" though, it should be working parallel.

Well, Lupin III already gave us a ""Gun of Jigen"" in episode 8 last month, so it wouldn't be surprising for the idea to show up here too.

The foreshadowing sets up the next crisis (as it spoiler[bleepin] should). Rather then coming out of left field with the tornado the last episode and killing off a semi-important support character. But I'm sure there's still time for the next episode to mess that up. Thanks episode 3 for planting that seed of doubt in me. Anyways...   Someone pointed out that the Hazard Cast machine maybe a macguffin that creates these chaotic scenarios. It's possible. But I've got a different theory involving Carneades.    The big bad Carneades is going to be a Moriarty like figure in this, exploiting Hazard Cast. With the Tornado, he likely prevented the radar from doing it's job. Rather then create a tornado with unknown tech.    With this new crisis involving the ship, I'm just going to wait and see before diving too deep into how this could connect to Carneades, Hazard Cast, and Asumi.   Random notes:  - Ran continues to baffle me. In episode 2, he's dunking bread crusts into an energy drink (gross).   - In this episode, Ran is like ""screw physics"" while his skateboard remains magically glued to his feet as he swings through the air like Tarzan in the Concrete Jungle.   - So Drug D is basically PCP (Angel Dust)?   To close, this series is pretty good. It's a B- for me so far. Maybe it can become an A+ in the future. We'll see.      Back to top                  Animegomaniac    Joined: 16 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 3891       Posted: Fri Jan 28, 2022 12:58 pm            I went into this series with one simple fact: Red, blue and green are a spectrum and these reviews that keep trying to break this analogue set up into digital descriptions is frustrating. The problems are broken down into binary, yes, but the solution should be more of a spectrum. To paraphrase what Mari aid about RBG: Everything can handle everything. But what about the individual colors?   ""Shu's in the middle."" Yes""... and that makes him central good."" No, that should make him True Neutral. Looking at Red we have Chaotic Good and at green, it's lawful evil.  Koki's an unapologetic fascist, can we come out and admit that? He's also a Libertarian but I feel that would kicking him while he's down already.    But why is Shu the superhero and not Ran? Something something responsibility, something power right? With great responsibility comes great power... and somebody went out of their way to make it into a superhero series. So Shu has to be the hero with hour of power because he's the responsible one.   That leaves Ran, who's interestingly no Robin Hood. He's self involved, he's particular, he's selective. Token Evil Teammate, the Heart and to top it off, the Lovable Rogue. No, I'm missing something about Ran because that should be heroic but something about Ran isn't, just like Koki by himself isn't a hero... Red should be hero, Blue should be lancer, hmm...   Is it really that simple? That Ran isn't dependable? ... and even the teamings are balanced; Ran has a group of Individuals he represents more than leads, Koki has no power over those SERG agents or the woman who's tied to, well, that but he does seem to lead them when the time comes to lead them.   Take this next problem... and review on it please. Shu is not going to be the one to decides who lives and who dies like Ran or Koki, the chaotic and evil people. He's going to save all of them because it's the right thing to do.   And I probably could keep going about this series as I do love it but not for what it's saying but what it says when it's not saying anything meaningful. So you'll see your politics reinforced because they're your politics and you can pick apart ones you disagree with because they're not.   Also... leaving this for last: the 24 ward is a manufactured place so all problems plaguing it are also manufactured, that's the point. The plot.

Quote:    The best it can offer is Ran trying to talk Kunai down with the base argument of ""This isn't how we do things"" because killing is badong.            So like this... but the part that came after it which negates it.  These reviews are awful.

As politely as possible. Cause there's some overthinking in there (eps 4 & 5), like Tokyo 24th Ward is supposed to be Shakespere when the level of writing is closer to Die Hard.   I don't know what you were expecting when a story arc is typically only an hour long (two episodes). They were never going to go deep into the division of classes. If that's what you were expecting. The first episode should have clued you in on how ""deep"" this show was going to be.     Quote:    But Tokyo 24th Ward can only articulate the world's stupidest moral dilemmas...            I would say specializes in simplified moral dilemmas that have to be solved in an hour of runtime. Maybe if this was Netflix, they could dedicate a season to a trolley dilemma. To really get to the heart of the issues the story may have brought up that led to the dilemma. But I imagine much of the audience would check out. Few showrunners could pull that off.     Quote:    ""I can't protect criminals,"" Koki intones at the end of this week's episode. It's a laugh given that we know the drug-dealing, land-sharking rich people on the ship are hardly law-abiding either            Do we though? Is the Captain of the ship in on it? The ship staff? The entertainment? Some of the plus ones invited to this? You're telling me they're all in on the shady deals? That just by being on the ship with shady people that it would be fine if the ship blew up?   Okay, if you say so.     Quote:    ...but it doesn't seem like any of the characters, nor the writer, nor the audience, walked away actually having learned anything about the ethics of these supposedly hard choices.            Yeah, I never expected that. Again, it should have been clear early on that this show was never going to be that deep or dramatic.

Given how much time is spent on the background of the supposed antagonist here, I was basically crushed when he was killed, though ofc not everyone on that boat was in any sense guilty. We aren’t meant to uncritically laud either the cops or the black-and-white thinking of Koki more generally here. Honestly, the amazing thing is that Ran and Koki can get along at all given their outlooks are so disparate, but it looks like this might be the thing that actually drives a wedge (which, good). Other than that, I didn’t love that Shu is kind of useless in this ep, but at the same time, I kind of like that action-man can’t just fix everything, too.

Quote:    how much of these events they actually set in motion purposefully            It's easy to mix up purposely and purposefully.  One trick is to think about their opposites, which are quite different:   purposely means ""on purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""by accident"" or ""unintentionally.""   purposefully means ""full of purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""pointlessly"" or ""aimlessly.""

Every week I'm ready to drop this, but then I don't and now we're half way through I'll probably stick with it (unless someone tells me it's slated for 24 or a split cour, in which case I'm out right now).

I thought in a series trying to point out binary choices in an analogue world would have Azumi both alive, really alive, and 100% dead.... and then the series took a further step I didn't expect.   ""The system is called KANAE and its receptacle is BRAIN.""  My reaction was not and I mean not ""OMG, that is Azumi."" This isn't that kind of series; Ran's a coward, Koki's a fascist because they are what they look like as this is not a nuanced or subtle series. So if they give you Azumi's body but call her by her mother's name, it's time to ask yourself ""What's in the Brain Box?!""

As it was presented, lightning would strike the cranes making them fall and lightning would strike the only person who could prevent them from falling. So save the person from the lightning and then they can stop the cranes?  Where's the difficult choice?   I think my brain is just too clogged with general crap to function any more, so no one need waste their time explaining something that's obvious to the average viewer.  I probably won't be able to understand that either, and it's not like I'm losing sleep over this.

My first thought was, ""Um, didn't we already know all this before?""  I guess the origin of the stupid name ""0th"" was kinda new, but I hadn't been wondering about that at all before now.   Sadly, my main takeaway from this was wondering how he got cut on the right side of his face when the broken car window was on his left.

I enjoyed ep 1 & 2. But with 3, that tornado was left field. I didn't like that twist.   They had already started foreshadowing two different groups as being shady. And neither of them played into being at the heart of the crisis this week. Not even the group that tried to cheat.   It's as if the showrunner thought a unexpected plot twist was more important then putting in the work via foreshadowing to make it a meaningful payoff. Just to subvert expectations on what the crisis was going to be. It bugs me.    Unless there was some clue I missed in 2 & 3 to suggest a natural disaster was coming this episode? Cause I don't remember anything like that.

I don't know, everywhere? This is an A++ series for me but I don't even know where to begin in explaining how great I think it is...   Yes, you picked up on the Trolley one and the show pointed it out but the second chaos point was centered around... political ideals of all things, the Libertarian versus the Liberal. Survival of the fittest versus protecting the weak. ""Taking the third option"" in the Trolley problem is par for the course but it's a lot more nuanced when it comes to politics built into your blood.    It's not ""working together"" though, it should be working parallel.

Well, Lupin III already gave us a ""Gun of Jigen"" in episode 8 last month, so it wouldn't be surprising for the idea to show up here too.       Back to top                  Spider3PO    Joined: 08 Jan 2022 		    Posts: 16       Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2022 3:32 pm            Episode 4: Corrects the ship, so to speak. The foreshadowing sets up the next crisis (as it spoiler[bleepin] should). Rather then coming out of left field with the tornado the last episode and killing off a semi-important support character. But I'm sure there's still time for the next episode to mess that up. Thanks episode 3 for planting that seed of doubt in me. Anyways...   Someone pointed out that the Hazard Cast machine maybe a macguffin that creates these chaotic scenarios. It's possible. But I've got a different theory involving Carneades.    The big bad Carneades is going to be a Moriarty like figure in this, exploiting Hazard Cast. With the Tornado, he likely prevented the radar from doing it's job. Rather then create a tornado with unknown tech.    With this new crisis involving the ship, I'm just going to wait and see before diving too deep into how this could connect to Carneades, Hazard Cast, and Asumi.   Random notes:  - Ran continues to baffle me. In episode 2, he's dunking bread crusts into an energy drink (gross).   - In this episode, Ran is like ""screw physics"" while his skateboard remains magically glued to his feet as he swings through the air like Tarzan in the Concrete Jungle.   - So Drug D is basically PCP (Angel Dust)?   To close, this series is pretty good. It's a B- for me so far. Maybe it can become an A+ in the future. We'll see.      Back to top                  Animegomaniac    Joined: 16 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 3891       Posted: Fri Jan 28, 2022 12:58 pm            I went into this series with one simple fact: Red, blue and green are a spectrum and these reviews that keep trying to break this analogue set up into digital descriptions is frustrating. The problems are broken down into binary, yes, but the solution should be more of a spectrum. To paraphrase what Mari aid about RBG: Everything can handle everything. But what about the individual colors?   ""Shu's in the middle."" Yes""... and that makes him central good."" No, that should make him True Neutral. Looking at Red we have Chaotic Good and at green, it's lawful evil.  Koki's an unapologetic fascist, can we come out and admit that? He's also a Libertarian but I feel that would kicking him while he's down already.    But why is Shu the superhero and not Ran? Something something responsibility, something power right? With great responsibility comes great power... and somebody went out of their way to make it into a superhero series. So Shu has to be the hero with hour of power because he's the responsible one.   That leaves Ran, who's interestingly no Robin Hood. He's self involved, he's particular, he's selective. Token Evil Teammate, the Heart and to top it off, the Lovable Rogue. No, I'm missing something about Ran because that should be heroic but something about Ran isn't, just like Koki by himself isn't a hero... Red should be hero, Blue should be lancer, hmm...   Is it really that simple? That Ran isn't dependable? ... and even the teamings are balanced; Ran has a group of Individuals he represents more than leads, Koki has no power over those SERG agents or the woman who's tied to, well, that but he does seem to lead them when the time comes to lead them.   Take this next problem... and review on it please. Shu is not going to be the one to decides who lives and who dies like Ran or Koki, the chaotic and evil people. He's going to save all of them because it's the right thing to do.   And I probably could keep going about this series as I do love it but not for what it's saying but what it says when it's not saying anything meaningful. So you'll see your politics reinforced because they're your politics and you can pick apart ones you disagree with because they're not.   Also... leaving this for last: the 24 ward is a manufactured place so all problems plaguing it are also manufactured, that's the point. The plot.

Quote:    The best it can offer is Ran trying to talk Kunai down with the base argument of ""This isn't how we do things"" because killing is badong.            So like this... but the part that came after it which negates it.  These reviews are awful.

As politely as possible. Cause there's some overthinking in there (eps 4 & 5), like Tokyo 24th Ward is supposed to be Shakespere when the level of writing is closer to Die Hard.   I don't know what you were expecting when a story arc is typically only an hour long (two episodes). They were never going to go deep into the division of classes. If that's what you were expecting. The first episode should have clued you in on how ""deep"" this show was going to be.     Quote:    But Tokyo 24th Ward can only articulate the world's stupidest moral dilemmas...            I would say specializes in simplified moral dilemmas that have to be solved in an hour of runtime. Maybe if this was Netflix, they could dedicate a season to a trolley dilemma. To really get to the heart of the issues the story may have brought up that led to the dilemma. But I imagine much of the audience would check out. Few showrunners could pull that off.     Quote:    ""I can't protect criminals,"" Koki intones at the end of this week's episode. It's a laugh given that we know the drug-dealing, land-sharking rich people on the ship are hardly law-abiding either            Do we though? Is the Captain of the ship in on it? The ship staff? The entertainment? Some of the plus ones invited to this? You're telling me they're all in on the shady deals? That just by being on the ship with shady people that it would be fine if the ship blew up?   Okay, if you say so.     Quote:    ...but it doesn't seem like any of the characters, nor the writer, nor the audience, walked away actually having learned anything about the ethics of these supposedly hard choices.            Yeah, I never expected that. Again, it should have been clear early on that this show was never going to be that deep or dramatic.

Given how much time is spent on the background of the supposed antagonist here, I was basically crushed when he was killed, though ofc not everyone on that boat was in any sense guilty. We aren’t meant to uncritically laud either the cops or the black-and-white thinking of Koki more generally here. Honestly, the amazing thing is that Ran and Koki can get along at all given their outlooks are so disparate, but it looks like this might be the thing that actually drives a wedge (which, good). Other than that, I didn’t love that Shu is kind of useless in this ep, but at the same time, I kind of like that action-man can’t just fix everything, too.

Quote:    how much of these events they actually set in motion purposefully            It's easy to mix up purposely and purposefully.  One trick is to think about their opposites, which are quite different:   purposely means ""on purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""by accident"" or ""unintentionally.""   purposefully means ""full of purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""pointlessly"" or ""aimlessly.""

I thought in a series trying to point out binary choices in an analogue world would have Azumi both alive, really alive, and 100% dead.... and then the series took a further step I didn't expect.   ""The system is called KANAE and its receptacle is BRAIN.""  My reaction was not and I mean not ""OMG, that is Azumi."" This isn't that kind of series; Ran's a coward, Koki's a fascist because they are what they look like as this is not a nuanced or subtle series. So if they give you Azumi's body but call her by her mother's name, it's time to ask yourself ""What's in the Brain Box?!""

As it was presented, lightning would strike the cranes making them fall and lightning would strike the only person who could prevent them from falling. So save the person from the lightning and then they can stop the cranes?  Where's the difficult choice?   I think my brain is just too clogged with general crap to function any more, so no one need waste their time explaining something that's obvious to the average viewer.  I probably won't be able to understand that either, and it's not like I'm losing sleep over this.

My first thought was, ""Um, didn't we already know all this before?""  I guess the origin of the stupid name ""0th"" was kinda new, but I hadn't been wondering about that at all before now.   Sadly, my main takeaway from this was wondering how he got cut on the right side of his face when the broken car window was on his left.

I enjoyed ep 1 & 2. But with 3, that tornado was left field. I didn't like that twist.   They had already started foreshadowing two different groups as being shady. And neither of them played into being at the heart of the crisis this week. Not even the group that tried to cheat.   It's as if the showrunner thought a unexpected plot twist was more important then putting in the work via foreshadowing to make it a meaningful payoff. Just to subvert expectations on what the crisis was going to be. It bugs me.    Unless there was some clue I missed in 2 & 3 to suggest a natural disaster was coming this episode? Cause I don't remember anything like that.

I don't know, everywhere? This is an A++ series for me but I don't even know where to begin in explaining how great I think it is...   Yes, you picked up on the Trolley one and the show pointed it out but the second chaos point was centered around... political ideals of all things, the Libertarian versus the Liberal. Survival of the fittest versus protecting the weak.

Someone pointed out that the Hazard Cast machine maybe a macguffin that creates these chaotic scenarios. It's possible. But I've got a different theory involving Carneades.

Looking at Red we have Chaotic Good and at green, it's lawful evil.  Koki's an unapologetic fascist, can we come out and admit that? He's also a Libertarian but I feel that would kicking him while he's down already.    But why is Shu the superhero and not Ran? Something something responsibility, something power right? With great responsibility comes great power... and somebody went out of their way to make it into a superhero series. So Shu has to be the hero with hour of power because he's the responsible one.   That leaves Ran, who's interestingly no Robin Hood. He's self involved, he's particular, he's selective. Token Evil Teammate, the Heart and to top it off, the Lovable Rogue. No, I'm missing something about Ran because that should be heroic but something about Ran isn't, just like Koki by himself isn't a hero... Red should be hero, Blue should be lancer, hmm...   Is it really that simple? That Ran isn't dependable? ... and even the teamings are balanced; Ran has a group of Individuals he represents more than leads, Koki has no power over those SERG agents or the woman who's tied to, well, that but he does seem to lead them when the time comes to lead them.   Take this next problem... and review on it please. Shu is not going to be the one to decides who lives and who dies like Ran or Koki, the chaotic and evil people. He's going to save all of them because it's the right thing to do.   And I probably could keep going about this series as I do love it but not for what it's saying but what it says when it's not saying anything meaningful. So you'll see your politics reinforced because they're your politics and you can pick apart ones you disagree with because they're not.   Also... leaving this for last: the 24 ward is a manufactured place so all problems plaguing it are also manufactured, that's the point. The plot.

As politely as possible. Cause there's some overthinking in there (eps 4 & 5), like Tokyo 24th Ward is supposed to be Shakespere when the level of writing is closer to Die Hard.   I don't know what you were expecting when a story arc is typically only an hour long (two episodes). They were never going to go deep into the division of classes. If that's what you were expecting. The first episode should have clued you in on how ""deep"" this show was going to be.     Quote:    But Tokyo 24th Ward can only articulate the world's stupidest moral dilemmas...            I would say specializes in simplified moral dilemmas that have to be solved in an hour of runtime. Maybe if this was Netflix, they could dedicate a season to a trolley dilemma. To really get to the heart of the issues the story may have brought up that led to the dilemma. But I imagine much of the audience would check out. Few showrunners could pull that off.     Quote:    ""I can't protect criminals,"" Koki intones at the end of this week's episode. It's a laugh given that we know the drug-dealing, land-sharking rich people on the ship are hardly law-abiding either            Do we though? Is the Captain of the ship in on it? The ship staff? The entertainment? Some of the plus ones invited to this? You're telling me they're all in on the shady deals? That just by being on the ship with shady people that it would be fine if the ship blew up?   Okay, if you say so.     Quote:    ...but it doesn't seem like any of the characters, nor the writer, nor the audience, walked away actually having learned anything about the ethics of these supposedly hard choices.            Yeah, I never expected that. Again, it should have been clear early on that this show was never going to be that deep or dramatic.

Given how much time is spent on the background of the supposed antagonist here, I was basically crushed when he was killed, though ofc not everyone on that boat was in any sense guilty. We aren’t meant to uncritically laud either the cops or the black-and-white thinking of Koki more generally here. Honestly, the amazing thing is that Ran and Koki can get along at all given their outlooks are so disparate, but it looks like this might be the thing that actually drives a wedge (which, good). Other than that, I didn’t love that Shu is kind of useless in this ep, but at the same time, I kind of like that action-man can’t just fix everything, too.

Quote:    how much of these events they actually set in motion purposefully            It's easy to mix up purposely and purposefully.  One trick is to think about their opposites, which are quite different:   purposely means ""on purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""by accident"" or ""unintentionally.""   purposefully means ""full of purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""pointlessly"" or ""aimlessly.""

I thought in a series trying to point out binary choices in an analogue world would have Azumi both alive, really alive, and 100% dead.... and then the series took a further step I didn't expect.   ""The system is called KANAE and its receptacle is BRAIN.""  My reaction was not and I mean not ""OMG, that is Azumi."" This isn't that kind of series; Ran's a coward, Koki's a fascist because they are what they look like as this is not a nuanced or subtle series. So if they give you Azumi's body but call her by her mother's name, it's time to ask yourself ""What's in the Brain Box?!""

As it was presented, lightning would strike the cranes making them fall and lightning would strike the only person who could prevent them from falling. So save the person from the lightning and then they can stop the cranes?  Where's the difficult choice?   I think my brain is just too clogged with general crap to function any more, so no one need waste their time explaining something that's obvious to the average viewer.  I probably won't be able to understand that either, and it's not like I'm losing sleep over this.

My first thought was, ""Um, didn't we already know all this before?""  I guess the origin of the stupid name ""0th"" was kinda new, but I hadn't been wondering about that at all before now.   Sadly, my main takeaway from this was wondering how he got cut on the right side of his face when the broken car window was on his left.

I enjoyed ep 1 & 2. But with 3, that tornado was left field. I didn't like that twist.   They had already started foreshadowing two different groups as being shady. And neither of them played into being at the heart of the crisis this week. Not even the group that tried to cheat.   It's as if the showrunner thought a unexpected plot twist was more important then putting in the work via foreshadowing to make it a meaningful payoff. Just to subvert expectations on what the crisis was going to be. It bugs me.    Unless there was some clue I missed in 2 & 3 to suggest a natural disaster was coming this episode? Cause I don't remember anything like that.

I don't know, everywhere? This is an A++ series for me but I don't even know where to begin in explaining how great I think it is...   Yes, you picked up on the Trolley one and the show pointed it out but the second chaos point was centered around... political ideals of all things, the Libertarian versus the Liberal. Survival of the fittest versus protecting the weak. ""Taking the third option"" in the Trolley problem is par for the course but it's a lot more nuanced when it comes to politics built into your blood.    It's not ""working together"" though, it should be working parallel.

Quote:    The best it can offer is Ran trying to talk Kunai down with the base argument of ""This isn't how we do things"" because killing is badong.

As politely as possible. Cause there's some overthinking in there (eps 4 & 5), like Tokyo 24th Ward is supposed to be Shakespere when the level of writing is closer to Die Hard.   I don't know what you were expecting when a story arc is typically only an hour long (two episodes). They were never going to go deep into the division of classes. If that's what you were expecting. The first episode should have clued you in on how ""deep"" this show was going to be.     Quote:    But Tokyo 24th Ward can only articulate the world's stupidest moral dilemmas...            I would say specializes in simplified moral dilemmas that have to be solved in an hour of runtime. Maybe if this was Netflix, they could dedicate a season to a trolley dilemma. To really get to the heart of the issues the story may have brought up that led to the dilemma. But I imagine much of the audience would check out. Few showrunners could pull that off.     Quote:    ""I can't protect criminals,"" Koki intones at the end of this week's episode. It's a laugh given that we know the drug-dealing, land-sharking rich people on the ship are hardly law-abiding either            Do we though? Is the Captain of the ship in on it? The ship staff? The entertainment? Some of the plus ones invited to this? You're telling me they're all in on the shady deals? That just by being on the ship with shady people that it would be fine if the ship blew up?   Okay, if you say so.     Quote:    ...but it doesn't seem like any of the characters, nor the writer, nor the audience, walked away actually having learned anything about the ethics of these supposedly hard choices.            Yeah, I never expected that. Again, it should have been clear early on that this show was never going to be that deep or dramatic.

Given how much time is spent on the background of the supposed antagonist here, I was basically crushed when he was killed, though ofc not everyone on that boat was in any sense guilty. We aren’t meant to uncritically laud either the cops or the black-and-white thinking of Koki more generally here. Honestly, the amazing thing is that Ran and Koki can get along at all given their outlooks are so disparate, but it looks like this might be the thing that actually drives a wedge (which, good). Other than that, I didn’t love that Shu is kind of useless in this ep, but at the same time, I kind of like that action-man can’t just fix everything, too.

Quote:    how much of these events they actually set in motion purposefully            It's easy to mix up purposely and purposefully.  One trick is to think about their opposites, which are quite different:   purposely means ""on purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""by accident"" or ""unintentionally.""   purposefully means ""full of purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""pointlessly"" or ""aimlessly.""

Every week I'm ready to drop this, but then I don't and now we're half way through I'll probably stick with it (unless someone tells me it's slated for 24 or a split cour, in which case I'm out right now).

I thought in a series trying to point out binary choices in an analogue world would have Azumi both alive, really alive, and 100% dead.... and then the series took a further step I didn't expect.   ""The system is called KANAE and its receptacle is BRAIN.""  My reaction was not and I mean not ""OMG, that is Azumi."" This isn't that kind of series; Ran's a coward, Koki's a fascist because they are what they look like as this is not a nuanced or subtle series. So if they give you Azumi's body but call her by her mother's name, it's time to ask yourself ""What's in the Brain Box?!""

As it was presented, lightning would strike the cranes making them fall and lightning would strike the only person who could prevent them from falling. So save the person from the lightning and then they can stop the cranes?  Where's the difficult choice?   I think my brain is just too clogged with general crap to function any more, so no one need waste their time explaining something that's obvious to the average viewer.  I probably won't be able to understand that either, and it's not like I'm losing sleep over this.

My first thought was, ""Um, didn't we already know all this before?""  I guess the origin of the stupid name ""0th"" was kinda new, but I hadn't been wondering about that at all before now.   Sadly, my main takeaway from this was wondering how he got cut on the right side of his face when the broken car window was on his left.

News A Couple of Cuckoos Anime Reveals Half-Year Run, Mini-Anime, Opening Sequence   posted on 2022-04-06 19:53 UTC-8 by Egan Loo          Kiyoe Yoshioka performs opening song ""Dekoboko""    The official website for the television anime of Miki Yoshikawa's A Couple of Cuckoos (Kakkō no Iinazuke) manga posted the main anime's continuous half-year run, mini-anime, and clean opening sequence on Wednesday. Kiyoe Yoshioka performs the opening theme song ""Dekoboko"" (Bumpy).        The anime will run for two cours (quarters of the year) with no breaks in between. The spinoff mini anime Kakkō no Iikagen will premiere on Kadokawa Anime's YouTube channel on April 28.       Kodansha Comics publishes the manga in English, and it describes the romantic comedy:    16-year-old super-studier Nagi Umino, second-year student at the Megurogawa Academy high school, was switched at birth. On his way to a dinner to meet his birth parents, he accidentally meets the brash, outspoken, Erika Amano, who is determined to make Nagi her fake boyfriend as she never wants to actually marry. But once Nagi makes it to dinner, he finds his parents have decided to resolve the hospital switch by conveniently having him marry the daughter his birth parents raised...who turns out to be none other than Erika herself!   The anime will star Kaito Ishikawa as Nagi Umino, Akari Kitō as Erika Amano, and Nao Tōyama as Hiro Segawa. Other cast members include:     Ryohei Kimura as Yōhei Umino, Nagi's father  Yōko Hikasa as Namie Umino, Nagi's mother  Toshiyuki Morikawa as Sōichirō Amano, Erika's father  Yukiko Aruga as Rituko Amano, Erika's mother   Hiroaki Akagi (Karakai Jōzu no Takagi-san, Those Snow White Notes) is the chief director of the anime and Yoshiyuki Shirahata (episode director for Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle, Great Pretender) is directing the anime at Shinei Animation and Synergy SP. Yasuhiro Nakanishi (Kaguya-sama: Love is War both seasons, Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun) is overseeing the series scripts, and Aya Takano (Karakai Jōzu no Takagi-san, Polar Bear's Café) is designing the characters. Ikimono-gakari vocalist Kiyoe Yoshioka performs the opening theme song ""Dekoboko"" (Rough), as heard in the video above.    Sangatsu no Phantasia performs the anime's ending theme song ""Shikaku Unmei"" (Square Destiny).    The anime will premiere in the NUMAnimation programming block on TV Asahi and its affiliates on April 23. Crunchyroll will stream the anime outside Japan.    Yoshikawa (Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches, Yankee-kun to Megane-chan) launched the A Couple of Cuckoos (Kakkō no Iinazuke) manga in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine in January 2020. Kodansha published the manga's 11th compiled book volume on Thursday. The manga received a novel that shipped in April 2021.    Shueisha's Young Jump magazine revealed in February that Yoshikawa's manga will have a collaboration with Aka Akasaka and Mengo Yokoyari's Oshi no Ko manga.

News A Couple of Cuckoos Anime Reveals Half-Year Run, Mini-Anime, Opening Sequence   posted on 2022-04-06 19:53 UTC-8 by Egan Loo          Kiyoe Yoshioka performs opening song ""Dekoboko""    The official website for the television anime of Miki Yoshikawa's A Couple of Cuckoos (Kakkō no Iinazuke) manga posted the main anime's continuous half-year run, mini-anime, and clean opening sequence on Wednesday. Kiyoe Yoshioka performs the opening theme song ""Dekoboko"" (Bumpy).        The anime will run for two cours (quarters of the year) with no breaks in between. The spinoff mini anime Kakkō no Iikagen will premiere on Kadokawa Anime's YouTube channel on April 28.       Kodansha Comics publishes the manga in English, and it describes the romantic comedy:    16-year-old super-studier Nagi Umino, second-year student at the Megurogawa Academy high school, was switched at birth. On his way to a dinner to meet his birth parents, he accidentally meets the brash, outspoken, Erika Amano, who is determined to make Nagi her fake boyfriend as she never wants to actually marry. But once Nagi makes it to dinner, he finds his parents have decided to resolve the hospital switch by conveniently having him marry the daughter his birth parents raised...who turns out to be none other than Erika herself!   The anime will star Kaito Ishikawa as Nagi Umino, Akari Kitō as Erika Amano, and Nao Tōyama as Hiro Segawa. Other cast members include:     Ryohei Kimura as Yōhei Umino, Nagi's father  Yōko Hikasa as Namie Umino, Nagi's mother  Toshiyuki Morikawa as Sōichirō Amano, Erika's father  Yukiko Aruga as Rituko Amano, Erika's mother   Hiroaki Akagi (Karakai Jōzu no Takagi-san, Those Snow White Notes) is the chief director of the anime and Yoshiyuki Shirahata (episode director for Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle, Great Pretender) is directing the anime at Shinei Animation and Synergy SP. Yasuhiro Nakanishi (Kaguya-sama: Love is War both seasons, Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun) is overseeing the series scripts, and Aya Takano (Karakai Jōzu no Takagi-san, Polar Bear's Café) is designing the characters. Ikimono-gakari vocalist Kiyoe Yoshioka performs the opening theme song ""Dekoboko"" (Rough), as heard in the video above.    Sangatsu no Phantasia performs the anime's ending theme song ""Shikaku Unmei"" (Square Destiny).    The anime will premiere in the NUMAnimation programming block on TV Asahi and its affiliates on April 23. Crunchyroll will stream the anime outside Japan.

News A Couple of Cuckoos Anime Reveals Half-Year Run, Mini-Anime, Opening Sequence   posted on 2022-04-06 19:53 UTC-8 by Egan Loo          Kiyoe Yoshioka performs opening song ""Dekoboko""    The official website for the television anime of Miki Yoshikawa's A Couple of Cuckoos (Kakkō no Iinazuke) manga posted the main anime's continuous half-year run, mini-anime, and clean opening sequence on Wednesday. Kiyoe Yoshioka performs the opening theme song ""Dekoboko"" (Bumpy).        The anime will run for two cours (quarters of the year) with no breaks in between. The spinoff mini anime Kakkō no Iikagen will premiere on Kadokawa Anime's YouTube channel on April 28.       Kodansha Comics publishes the manga in English, and it describes the romantic comedy:    16-year-old super-studier Nagi Umino, second-year student at the Megurogawa Academy high school, was switched at birth. On his way to a dinner to meet his birth parents, he accidentally meets the brash, outspoken, Erika Amano, who is determined to make Nagi her fake boyfriend as she never wants to actually marry. But once Nagi makes it to dinner, he finds his parents have decided to resolve the hospital switch by conveniently having him marry the daughter his birth parents raised...who turns out to be none other than Erika herself!   The anime will star Kaito Ishikawa as Nagi Umino, Akari Kitō as Erika Amano, and Nao Tōyama as Hiro Segawa. Other cast members include:     Ryohei Kimura as Yōhei Umino, Nagi's father  Yōko Hikasa as Namie Umino, Nagi's mother  Toshiyuki Morikawa as Sōichirō Amano, Erika's father  Yukiko Aruga as Rituko Amano, Erika's mother   Hiroaki Akagi (Karakai Jōzu no Takagi-san, Those Snow White Notes) is the chief director of the anime and Yoshiyuki Shirahata (episode director for Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle, Great Pretender) is directing the anime at Shinei Animation and Synergy SP. Yasuhiro Nakanishi (Kaguya-sama: Love is War both seasons, Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun) is overseeing the series scripts, and Aya Takano (Karakai Jōzu no Takagi-san, Polar Bear's Café) is designing the characters. Ikimono-gakari vocalist Kiyoe Yoshioka performs the opening theme song ""Dekoboko"" (Rough), as heard in the video above.    Sangatsu no Phantasia performs the anime's ending theme song ""Shikaku Unmei"" (Square Destiny).    The anime will premiere in the NUMAnimation programming block on TV Asahi and its affiliates on April 23. Crunchyroll will stream the anime outside Japan.    Yoshikawa (Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches, Yankee-kun to Megane-chan) launched the A Couple of Cuckoos (Kakkō no Iinazuke) manga in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine in January 2020. Kodansha published the manga's 11th compiled book volume on Thursday. The manga received a novel that shipped in April 2021.    Shueisha's Young Jump magazine revealed in February that Yoshikawa's manga will have a collaboration with Aka Akasaka and Mengo Yokoyari's Oshi no Ko manga.

Interest Cygames Supports Cat Longevity Research   posted on 2022-04-07 04:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee         ""It is said that there are nearly 10 million cats in Japan today, and for many cat owners, cats are irreplaceable companions that enrich their lives and bring them joy.""    Cygames announced on Twitter on Monday that it has made a donation to the AIM Medical Research Institute (abbreviated as IAM), a group dedicated to the research of the AIM protein. The protein is said to have the potential to expand the average lifespan of cats.     株式会社Cygames、血中タンパク質「AIM」に関する研究を行うAIM医学研究所への寄付を実施　～ネコ薬の開発により猫の寿命伸長に貢献～ | 株式会社Cygames https://t.co/kRJemAAADc— Cygames公式アカウント (@Cygames_PR) April 4, 2022     AIM (short for Apoptosis Inhibitor of Macrophage) is a protein found in macrophages. The protein has been shown to be useful in the treatment of kidney diseases, which many domestic cats develop in old age. If administered at a young age, a properly functioning dose of AIM is said to reduce the onset of kidney disease in cats, possibly doubling their average lifespan.    Toru Miyazaki, who heads the research group, had been working on the development of an AIM drug for cats, but was forced to temporarily suspend his research due to funding difficulties. In light of this, Cygames has decided to provide ongoing donation support for the research until the practical application of the drug is realized.     ""The support of companies in fields completely different from medicine and pharmaceuticals is a great encouragement to us,"" Miyazaki commented. ""We will use this donation, along with the many other donations we have received from the general public, to greatly accelerate our research on AIM. All of our researchers will do their utmost to complete the AIM drug as soon as possible.""    Yuito Kimura, Senior Managing Director of Cygames, also commented on the donation: ""It is said that there are nearly 10 million cats in Japan today, and for many cat owners, cats are irreplaceable companions that enrich their lives and bring them joy. We are happy that our donation will help them to cure their partners from incurable diseases and save many lives.""    Cygames celebrated its 10th anniversary last year. The company has produced games such as Rage of Bahamut and Granblue Fantasy. Cygames established an anime division in March 2015 and the anime production subsidiary Cygames Pictures in April 2016. The company has worked on anime productions inspired by its games including Rage of Bahamut Genesis, Rage of Bahamut: Virgin Soul, Uma Musume Pretty Derby, and Granblue Fantasy the Animation.

Interest Cygames Supports Cat Longevity Research   posted on 2022-04-07 04:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee         ""It is said that there are nearly 10 million cats in Japan today, and for many cat owners, cats are irreplaceable companions that enrich their lives and bring them joy.""    Cygames announced on Twitter on Monday that it has made a donation to the AIM Medical Research Institute (abbreviated as IAM), a group dedicated to the research of the AIM protein. The protein is said to have the potential to expand the average lifespan of cats.     株式会社Cygames、血中タンパク質「AIM」に関する研究を行うAIM医学研究所への寄付を実施　～ネコ薬の開発により猫の寿命伸長に貢献～ | 株式会社Cygames https://t.co/kRJemAAADc— Cygames公式アカウント (@Cygames_PR) April 4, 2022     AIM (short for Apoptosis Inhibitor of Macrophage) is a protein found in macrophages. The protein has been shown to be useful in the treatment of kidney diseases, which many domestic cats develop in old age. If administered at a young age, a properly functioning dose of AIM is said to reduce the onset of kidney disease in cats, possibly doubling their average lifespan.    Toru Miyazaki, who heads the research group, had been working on the development of an AIM drug for cats, but was forced to temporarily suspend his research due to funding difficulties. In light of this, Cygames has decided to provide ongoing donation support for the research until the practical application of the drug is realized.     ""The support of companies in fields completely different from medicine and pharmaceuticals is a great encouragement to us,"" Miyazaki commented. ""We will use this donation, along with the many other donations we have received from the general public, to greatly accelerate our research on AIM. All of our researchers will do their utmost to complete the AIM drug as soon as possible.""    Yuito Kimura, Senior Managing Director of Cygames, also commented on the donation: ""It is said that there are nearly 10 million cats in Japan today, and for many cat owners, cats are irreplaceable companions that enrich their lives and bring them joy. We are happy that our donation will help them to cure their partners from incurable diseases and save many lives.""    Cygames celebrated its 10th anniversary last year. The company has produced games such as Rage of Bahamut and Granblue Fantasy. Cygames established an anime division in March 2015 and the anime production subsidiary Cygames Pictures in April 2016. The company has worked on anime productions inspired by its games including Rage of Bahamut Genesis, Rage of Bahamut: Virgin Soul, Uma Musume Pretty Derby, and Granblue Fantasy the Animation.

Cygames announced on Twitter on Monday that it has made a donation to the AIM Medical Research Institute (abbreviated as IAM), a group dedicated to the research of the AIM protein. The protein is said to have the potential to expand the average lifespan of cats.     株式会社Cygames、血中タンパク質「AIM」に関する研究を行うAIM医学研究所への寄付を実施　～ネコ薬の開発により猫の寿命伸長に貢献～ | 株式会社Cygames https://t.co/kRJemAAADc— Cygames公式アカウント (@Cygames_PR) April 4, 2022     AIM (short for Apoptosis Inhibitor of Macrophage) is a protein found in macrophages. The protein has been shown to be useful in the treatment of kidney diseases, which many domestic cats develop in old age. If administered at a young age, a properly functioning dose of AIM is said to reduce the onset of kidney disease in cats, possibly doubling their average lifespan.    Toru Miyazaki, who heads the research group, had been working on the development of an AIM drug for cats, but was forced to temporarily suspend his research due to funding difficulties. In light of this, Cygames has decided to provide ongoing donation support for the research until the practical application of the drug is realized.     ""The support of companies in fields completely different from medicine and pharmaceuticals is a great encouragement to us,"" Miyazaki commented. ""We will use this donation, along with the many other donations we have received from the general public, to greatly accelerate our research on AIM. All of our researchers will do their utmost to complete the AIM drug as soon as possible.""    Yuito Kimura, Senior Managing Director of Cygames, also commented on the donation: ""It is said that there are nearly 10 million cats in Japan today, and for many cat owners, cats are irreplaceable companions that enrich their lives and bring them joy. We are happy that our donation will help them to cure their partners from incurable diseases and save many lives.""    Cygames celebrated its 10th anniversary last year.

XSEED Games Announces Story of Seasons: Pioneers of Olive Town Coming to PlayStation®4   Apr  9th 2022         Cozy Farm/Life Sim to Release This Summer  TORRANCE, Calif. – Apr. 8, 2022 – XSEED Games, the independent-minded publishing brand of Marvelous USA, Inc., today announced their popular farm/life sim title STORY OF SEASONS: Pioneers of Olive Town will be released on PlayStation®4 computer entertainment system this summer. STORY OF SEASONS: Pioneers of Olive Town will be in full bloom with HD visuals and the series' signature charm, and will be available as a standard physical edition for a MSRP of $39.99, with details on digital offerings and pricing to be announced at a later date.  STORY OF SEASONS: Pioneers of Olive Town is a charming adventure in the original farming simulation series that drops eager explorers in Olive Town, a picturesque seaside community on the edge of the untamed frontier, where they will work to breathe life back into their grandfather's dilapidated farm. They'll clear the land, repair old facilities, and place new ones wherever they see fit, leveling up their farming skills and crafting a variety of decorations and facilities, from fences and automatic feeders for livestock to sprinklers for crops! And though it may at first appear to be a sleepy burg, Olive Town is home to dozens of unique characters to befriend when players are ready to take a break from building their dream farm.    Developed by Marvelous, Inc. and published in North America by XSEED Games, STORY OF SEASONS: Pioneers of Olive Town will launch on the PS4™ system in summer 2022, following its prior launches for PC on Sept. 15, 2021, and on Nintendo Switch™ in North America on Mar. 23, 2021.

XSEED Games Announces Story of Seasons: Pioneers of Olive Town Coming to PlayStation®4   Apr  9th 2022         Cozy Farm/Life Sim to Release This Summer  TORRANCE, Calif. – Apr. 8, 2022 – XSEED Games, the independent-minded publishing brand of Marvelous USA, Inc., today announced their popular farm/life sim title STORY OF SEASONS: Pioneers of Olive Town will be released on PlayStation®4 computer entertainment system this summer. STORY OF SEASONS: Pioneers of Olive Town will be in full bloom with HD visuals and the series' signature charm, and will be available as a standard physical edition for a MSRP of $39.99, with details on digital offerings and pricing to be announced at a later date.  STORY OF SEASONS: Pioneers of Olive Town is a charming adventure in the original farming simulation series that drops eager explorers in Olive Town, a picturesque seaside community on the edge of the untamed frontier, where they will work to breathe life back into their grandfather's dilapidated farm. They'll clear the land, repair old facilities, and place new ones wherever they see fit, leveling up their farming skills and crafting a variety of decorations and facilities, from fences and automatic feeders for livestock to sprinklers for crops! And though it may at first appear to be a sleepy burg, Olive Town is home to dozens of unique characters to befriend when players are ready to take a break from building their dream farm.    Developed by Marvelous, Inc. and published in North America by XSEED Games, STORY OF SEASONS: Pioneers of Olive Town will launch on the PS4™ system in summer 2022, following its prior launches for PC on Sept. 15, 2021, and on Nintendo Switch™ in North America on Mar. 23, 2021.

XSEED Games Announces Story of Seasons: Pioneers of Olive Town Coming to PlayStation®4   Apr  9th 2022         Cozy Farm/Life Sim to Release This Summer  TORRANCE, Calif. – Apr. 8, 2022 – XSEED Games, the independent-minded publishing brand of Marvelous USA, Inc., today announced their popular farm/life sim title STORY OF SEASONS: Pioneers of Olive Town will be released on PlayStation®4 computer entertainment system this summer.

STORY OF SEASONS: Pioneers of Olive Town is a charming adventure in the original farming simulation series that drops eager explorers in Olive Town, a picturesque seaside community on the edge of the untamed frontier, where they will work to breathe life back into their grandfather's dilapidated farm. They'll clear the land, repair old facilities, and place new ones wherever they see fit, leveling up their farming skills and crafting a variety of decorations and facilities, from fences and automatic feeders for livestock to sprinklers for crops! And though it may at first appear to be a sleepy burg, Olive Town is home to dozens of unique characters to befriend when players are ready to take a break from building their dream farm.    Developed by Marvelous, Inc. and published in North America by XSEED Games, STORY OF SEASONS: Pioneers of Olive Town will launch on the PS4™ system in summer 2022, following its prior launches for PC on Sept. 15, 2021, and on Nintendo Switch™ in North America on Mar. 23, 2021.

Love of Kill Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Love of Kill ?                     Community score: 3.6            Given the sheer amount of weight this final episode needed to carry, I must admit I'm a little bit conflicted. I kinda knew going in that there was no way this episode was going to tie up the present-day plot thread of the mob boss going after everybody. If anything, it just kinda hammers home how unimportant it is both to the present-day narrative and what goes on in the flashbacks. Looking back on the season as a whole, I definitely think that the material that is adapted shouldn't have taken up as many episodes as it did. While I will admit that the final revelations for everything in the past are mostly satisfying, it wasn't worth the incredibly slow, drawn-out pace that it took to get here. It genuinely feels like the writer of the season started with the decision to end the season with said revelations and then worked backwards to try to fill in the rest of the series. I don't know if this is all handled differently in the source material but that final shot of Château and Ryang-ha squaring off against this organization didn't exactly make me excited for future installments. At the same time, however, I did walk away with some sense of dramatic and emotional pay off.    This whole time I was led to believe that Ryang-ha was only interested in Chateau for more plot-driven reasons. When he says that he's happy the events of his past weren't just a dream, I was caught off guard by its surprising emotional impact. Château was traumatized by her past and completely forgot about it for the sake of her own sense of mental and emotional stability. So it also makes sense that years later growing up, she would start to feel the weight of what she did as a child to someone who was just trying to help her. The show is still very vague on what exactly the original Ryang-ha's mission was, so it's hard to see if he was always tasked with getting her to safety or if she was meant to be delivered to somebody else.    Again the show's plotting isn't necessarily the best, and as mentioned, I think cutting out some of the bloat in the previous episodes could've allowed the show to better flesh out the good elements that were actually here. The show manages to convey the emotions that Château and Ryang-ha felt for the original Ryang-ha, but I just wish I knew him more as a character. Ultimately, he definitely comes across as a naïve albeit kind-hearted kid that was just trying to help people regardless of whether or not he knew what Donny had planned for him all along. There is a sense of tragedy and sadness in him doing everything he can but alas, the show wasn't really about this boy. It has always been more interested in the current Ryang-ha and Château, and I think the reason why I feel so emotionally invested towards things in the end is because of what they're feeling, rather than the narrative putting me in a similar headspace to their emotional investment. A part of me does want to go back and rewatch the show now that I have this added context for why Ryang-ha was doing the things that he did, although I might also pick apart some of the really REALLY strong narrative conveniences that made them meet in the first place. I think the show excelled as a mystery and as a callback to that classic noir, “being in love with danger” aesthetic that we don't really see a lot of these days. I can see all of the building blocks to a successful thriller here but unfortunately, the show holds itself back from successfully landing the kill.

Love of Kill Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Love of Kill ?                     Community score: 3.6            Given the sheer amount of weight this final episode needed to carry, I must admit I'm a little bit conflicted. I kinda knew going in that there was no way this episode was going to tie up the present-day plot thread of the mob boss going after everybody. If anything, it just kinda hammers home how unimportant it is both to the present-day narrative and what goes on in the flashbacks. Looking back on the season as a whole, I definitely think that the material that is adapted shouldn't have taken up as many episodes as it did. While I will admit that the final revelations for everything in the past are mostly satisfying, it wasn't worth the incredibly slow, drawn-out pace that it took to get here. It genuinely feels like the writer of the season started with the decision to end the season with said revelations and then worked backwards to try to fill in the rest of the series. I don't know if this is all handled differently in the source material but that final shot of Château and Ryang-ha squaring off against this organization didn't exactly make me excited for future installments. At the same time, however, I did walk away with some sense of dramatic and emotional pay off.    This whole time I was led to believe that Ryang-ha was only interested in Chateau for more plot-driven reasons. When he says that he's happy the events of his past weren't just a dream, I was caught off guard by its surprising emotional impact. Château was traumatized by her past and completely forgot about it for the sake of her own sense of mental and emotional stability. So it also makes sense that years later growing up, she would start to feel the weight of what she did as a child to someone who was just trying to help her. The show is still very vague on what exactly the original Ryang-ha's mission was, so it's hard to see if he was always tasked with getting her to safety or if she was meant to be delivered to somebody else.    Again the show's plotting isn't necessarily the best, and as mentioned, I think cutting out some of the bloat in the previous episodes could've allowed the show to better flesh out the good elements that were actually here. The show manages to convey the emotions that Château and Ryang-ha felt for the original Ryang-ha, but I just wish I knew him more as a character. Ultimately, he definitely comes across as a naïve albeit kind-hearted kid that was just trying to help people regardless of whether or not he knew what Donny had planned for him all along. There is a sense of tragedy and sadness in him doing everything he can but alas, the show wasn't really about this boy. It has always been more interested in the current Ryang-ha and Château, and I think the reason why I feel so emotionally invested towards things in the end is because of what they're feeling, rather than the narrative putting me in a similar headspace to their emotional investment. A part of me does want to go back and rewatch the show now that I have this added context for why Ryang-ha was doing the things that he did, although I might also pick apart some of the really REALLY strong narrative conveniences that made them meet in the first place. I think the show excelled as a mystery and as a callback to that classic noir, “being in love with danger” aesthetic that we don't really see a lot of these days. I can see all of the building blocks to a successful thriller here but unfortunately, the show holds itself back from successfully landing the kill.

The show is still very vague on what exactly the original Ryang-ha's mission was, so it's hard to see if he was always tasked with getting her to safety or if she was meant to be delivered to somebody else.    Again the show's plotting isn't necessarily the best, and as mentioned, I think cutting out some of the bloat in the previous episodes could've allowed the show to better flesh out the good elements that were actually here. The show manages to convey the emotions that Château and Ryang-ha felt for the original Ryang-ha, but I just wish I knew him more as a character. Ultimately, he definitely comes across as a naïve albeit kind-hearted kid that was just trying to help people regardless of whether or not he knew what Donny had planned for him all along. There is a sense of tragedy and sadness in him doing everything he can but alas, the show wasn't really about this boy. It has always been more interested in the current Ryang-ha and Château, and I think the reason why I feel so emotionally invested towards things in the end is because of what they're feeling, rather than the narrative putting me in a similar headspace to their emotional investment. A part of me does want to go back and rewatch the show now that I have this added context for why Ryang-ha was doing the things that he did, although I might also pick apart some of the really REALLY strong narrative conveniences that made them meet in the first place. I think the show excelled as a mystery and as a callback to that classic noir, “being in love with danger” aesthetic that we don't really see a lot of these days. I can see all of the building blocks to a successful thriller here but unfortunately, the show holds itself back from successfully landing the kill.

The new cast does sound quite good in the promo, but it will still tale some time to get used to them after listening to the original cast these past 35 years since I first saw UY. I'd love to see some of the original cast making an appearance as some of the minor characters. I'd love to see Lum and Ataru's original voice actors playing Ataru's parents!

Some of the individual plots wouldn't work in the smartphone era, but I think the characterization would translate pretty well. (""Daaarliiing, that's the FIFTH girl I've seen you ask for her name and LINE handle, TODAY, while WALKING TO SCHOOL!"")   …I wonder what kind of mayhem could ensue from Lum whipping up a Twitter bot. Or hacking the server for an Apex Legends knockoff. (Possibly one published by the Mendo Conglomerate.) Or what excuse Ataru might come up with for needing another hard drive after he's filled his up with porn.

The new cast does sound quite good in the promo, but it will still tale some time to get used to them after listening to the original cast these past 35 years since I first saw UY. I'd love to see some of the original cast making an appearance as some of the minor characters. I'd love to see Lum and Ataru's original voice actors playing Ataru's parents!

Some of the individual plots wouldn't work in the smartphone era, but I think the characterization would translate pretty well. (""Daaarliiing, that's the FIFTH girl I've seen you ask for her name and LINE handle, TODAY, while WALKING TO SCHOOL!"")   …I wonder what kind of mayhem could ensue from Lum whipping up a Twitter bot. Or hacking the server for an Apex Legends knockoff. (Possibly one published by the Mendo Conglomerate.) Or what excuse Ataru might come up with for needing another hard drive after he's filled his up with porn.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).

Manga Goes on Hiatus   posted on 2022-04-08 03:30 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Ai Takahashi cites ""personal circumstances"" as reason for hiatus    Ai Takahashi's manga adaptation of Sai Sumimori's Am I Actually the Strongest? (Jitsu wa Ore, Saikyō deshita?) novel series updated on Wednesday to announce that the manga will go on hiatus due to ""personal circumstances"" affecting Takahashi. The manga will reveal a continuation date at a later time.    Kodansha Comics is publishing the manga digitally in English, and it describes the series:    To be reincarnated into another world with the promise of a ""cheat"" power is one thing... but to be reborn as a baby, and then left for dead after your royal parents think you're powerless?? That's another thing entirely! Now the newly-born Reinhart—or Hart to his new friends—must find his way through a dangerous world...but luckily he's got magic that's quite literally off the charts!   Takahashi launched the manga in the Kodansha's Suiyōbi no Sirius section of the Nico Nico Seiga website in April 2019. Kodansha published the manga's sixth compiled book volume in November 2021. Kodansha Comics published the fifth volume digitally in September 2021.    Sumimori began serializing the story in the Shōsetsuka ni Narō website in September 2018, where it is still ongoing. Kodansha published the first print novel volume with illustrations also by Ai Takahashi in May 2019, and it published the fifth novel volume in October 2021.

Manga Goes on Hiatus   posted on 2022-04-08 03:30 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Ai Takahashi cites ""personal circumstances"" as reason for hiatus    Ai Takahashi's manga adaptation of Sai Sumimori's Am I Actually the Strongest? (Jitsu wa Ore, Saikyō deshita?) novel series updated on Wednesday to announce that the manga will go on hiatus due to ""personal circumstances"" affecting Takahashi. The manga will reveal a continuation date at a later time.    Kodansha Comics is publishing the manga digitally in English, and it describes the series:    To be reincarnated into another world with the promise of a ""cheat"" power is one thing... but to be reborn as a baby, and then left for dead after your royal parents think you're powerless?? That's another thing entirely! Now the newly-born Reinhart—or Hart to his new friends—must find his way through a dangerous world...but luckily he's got magic that's quite literally off the charts!   Takahashi launched the manga in the Kodansha's Suiyōbi no Sirius section of the Nico Nico Seiga website in April 2019. Kodansha published the manga's sixth compiled book volume in November 2021. Kodansha Comics published the fifth volume digitally in September 2021.    Sumimori began serializing the story in the Shōsetsuka ni Narō website in September 2018, where it is still ongoing. Kodansha published the first print novel volume with illustrations also by Ai Takahashi in May 2019, and it published the fifth novel volume in October 2021.

News Tesla Note Manga Ends in Next Chapter   posted on 2022-04-07 00:00 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Manga launched in January 2021, inspired TV anime in October 2021    The 57th chapter of Kōta Sannomiya, Masafumi Nishida, and Tadayoshi Kubo's Tesla Note manga revealed on Wednesday that the manga will end in its next chapter. The manga updates every Wednesday, so if there are no delays, the manga will end on April 13.    Kodansha Comics is publishing the manga in English, and it describes the story:    Botan Negoro is not your average high school girl—she's been trained to be an elite government agent since she was young. She's also an expert on the ""Tesla Fragment"", which appear throughout the world to cause supernatural chaos. Her mission is to retrieve these fragments, and to do so she teams up with the smarmy, self-proclaimed top agent Kuruma. But this is no easy mission, even for an elite team...   Sannomiya, Masafumi Nishida, and Tadayoshi Kubo launched the manga in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine in January 2021. The manga transferred to Kodansha's Magazine Pocket app in August 2021. Nishida and Kubo are credited with the original work, while Sannomiya is drawing the art. Kodansha published the manga's fifth volume on January 17, and will publish the sixth volume on April 15. Sannomiya previously tweeted that the manga had reached  ""pretty much the halfway point"" of its story by the fourth volume. Kodansha Comics published the manga's third volume digitally on February 22.    The manga inspired a television anime that premiered in October 2021. Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan.

News Tesla Note Manga Ends in Next Chapter   posted on 2022-04-07 00:00 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Manga launched in January 2021, inspired TV anime in October 2021    The 57th chapter of Kōta Sannomiya, Masafumi Nishida, and Tadayoshi Kubo's Tesla Note manga revealed on Wednesday that the manga will end in its next chapter. The manga updates every Wednesday, so if there are no delays, the manga will end on April 13.    Kodansha Comics is publishing the manga in English, and it describes the story:    Botan Negoro is not your average high school girl—she's been trained to be an elite government agent since she was young. She's also an expert on the ""Tesla Fragment"", which appear throughout the world to cause supernatural chaos. Her mission is to retrieve these fragments, and to do so she teams up with the smarmy, self-proclaimed top agent Kuruma. But this is no easy mission, even for an elite team...   Sannomiya, Masafumi Nishida, and Tadayoshi Kubo launched the manga in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine in January 2021. The manga transferred to Kodansha's Magazine Pocket app in August 2021. Nishida and Kubo are credited with the original work, while Sannomiya is drawing the art. Kodansha published the manga's fifth volume on January 17, and will publish the sixth volume on April 15. Sannomiya previously tweeted that the manga had reached  ""pretty much the halfway point"" of its story by the fourth volume. Kodansha Comics published the manga's third volume digitally on February 22.    The manga inspired a television anime that premiered in October 2021. Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan.

Her mission is to retrieve these fragments, and to do so she teams up with the smarmy, self-proclaimed top agent Kuruma. But this is no easy mission, even for an elite team...   Sannomiya, Masafumi Nishida, and Tadayoshi Kubo launched the manga in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine in January 2021. The manga transferred to Kodansha's Magazine Pocket app in August 2021. Nishida and Kubo are credited with the original work, while Sannomiya is drawing the art. Kodansha published the manga's fifth volume on January 17, and will publish the sixth volume on April 15. Sannomiya previously tweeted that the manga had reached  ""pretty much the halfway point"" of its story by the fourth volume. Kodansha Comics published the manga's third volume digitally on February 22.    The manga inspired a television anime that premiered in October 2021. Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan.

Kodansha Comics is publishing the manga in English, and it describes the story:    Botan Negoro is not your average high school girl—she's been trained to be an elite government agent since she was young. She's also an expert on the ""Tesla Fragment"", which appear throughout the world to cause supernatural chaos. Her mission is to retrieve these fragments, and to do so she teams up with the smarmy, self-proclaimed top agent Kuruma. But this is no easy mission, even for an elite team...   Sannomiya, Masafumi Nishida, and Tadayoshi Kubo launched the manga in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine in January 2021. The manga transferred to Kodansha's Magazine Pocket app in August 2021. Nishida and Kubo are credited with the original work, while Sannomiya is drawing the art. Kodansha published the manga's fifth volume on January 17, and will publish the sixth volume on April 15. Sannomiya previously tweeted that the manga had reached  ""pretty much the halfway point"" of its story by the fourth volume. Kodansha Comics published the manga's third volume digitally on February 22.    The manga inspired a television anime that premiered in October 2021. Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan.

Can Eren be saved?                    ep. review          31 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ SEASON FINALE   Apr  4, 02:30 31 comments                 anime    Change to the company is coming to the Monster Development Department here in this final episode.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ SEASON FINALE   Apr  3, 01:30 95 comments                 anime    But if this final confrontation does anything apart from solidify Noé's and Vanitas' relationship, that would be to finally make Vanitas start moving forward again.                    ep. review          36 comments       Love of Kill ‒ SEASON FINALE   Apr  3, 00:30 36 comments                 anime    I don't know if this is all handled differently in the source material but that final shot of Château and Ryang-ha squaring off against this organization didn't exactly make me excited for future installments.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ SEASON FINALE   Apr  2, 01:30 47 comments                 anime    The series had its growing pains, but Arifureta's second season manages to wrap in a mostly satisfying way.                    ep. review          168 comments       Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ‒ Episode 86   Apr  2, 00:30 168 comments                 anime    “Retrospective” features some of the goriest and impressively choreographed action that The Final Season has ever delivered, and every character gets a moment to shine.                    ep. review          15 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 11   Mar 31, 23:30 15 comments                 anime    Would this anime have actually worked if it was a video game instead?                    ep. review          27 comments       Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 31, 05:30 27 comments                 anime    “March 14th” is one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime.                    ep. review          48 comments       Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 31, 03:30 48 comments                 anime    Fantasy Knockout reminds its viewers that it's important to tell your friends that you care about them...and maybe a little more.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 31, 02:30 89 comments                 anime    Wein is facing a war that Natra cannot hope to win and that is the crux of his latest genius plan—well, one of them at least.                    ep. review          81 comments       Akebi's Sailor Uniform ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 06:30 81 comments                 anime    Episode 12 feels like a celebration of three months with the world's most charming middle schooler                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 05:30 19 comments                 anime    I love a last-minute heel turn (with GUNS!), even if it's crammed into twenty-four minutes of not the best paced scripting. But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 04:30 18 comments                 anime    In Slow Loop's naturally gentle way, an empty photo album becomes a perfect way to hint at a new adventure: picking out pictures from the past few seasons together to fill the album with not just as sisters, but as friends.                    ep. review          76 comments       Princess Connect! Re:Dive Season 2 ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 03:30 76 comments                 anime    This, the final episode of Princess Connect! Re:Dive, is a roller coaster.                    ep. review          58 comments       Sasaki and Miyano ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 02:30 58 comments                 anime    This entire episode is a single-minded lead-up to the confession scene we've been waiting weeks to see.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 01:30 51 comments                 anime    After last week's stunner, there aren't a whole lot of surprises left in Sabikui Bisco's bag of tricks, but it doesn't need them to pull together a satisfying and highly fungal finale.                    ep. review          42 comments       Requiem of the Rose King ‒ Episode 12   Mar 30, 00:30 42 comments                 anime    Now we approach the winter of our discontent as we see Richard turn to violence, which has become his go-to method for coping with things he can't actually handle.                    ep. review          31 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ Episode 11   Mar 29, 02:30 31 comments                 anime    Miss Kuroitsu has routinely turned in great comedic episodes, but this one felt exceptionally mediocre for a series approaching its finale.                    ep. review          145 comments       How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 ‒ Episode 12   Mar 29, 01:30 145 comments                 anime    There's really no getting around it: I found the first half of this episode bizarre and dull.                    ep. review          341 comments       My Dress-Up Darling ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 28, 23:30 341 comments                 anime    This episode cements My Dress-Up Darling as a romance about two characters coming into their own all along and makes for one of the best season finales one could hope for.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 23   Mar 26, 05:30 95 comments                 anime    Mikhaïl's machinations are pushing Noé and Vanitas into a position they may not be able to recover from. Like Vanitas' hourglass, all the sand is in one section. Maybe it's time to flip it over and start moving.                    ep. review          36 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 11   Mar 26, 04:30 36 comments                 anime    We have one final episode left and I’m starting to have trepidation that the conclusion won’t be as satisfactory as I think I wanted it to but at least it might end up satiating my curiosity.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 26, 03:30 45 comments                 anime    Here we are at the true proper conclusion of the land of Leadale and… I still have no idea what this show was trying to do or even who it was for.                    ep. review          177 comments       Ranking of Kings ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 26, 02:30 177 comments                 anime    The series often showed that while the world includes unimaginable depths of cruelty, a community can still be forged in empathy and kindness. I think all of us need to know that.                    ep. review          81 comments       Akebi's Sailor Uniform ‒ Episodes 10-11   Mar 26, 01:30 81 comments                 anime    There's this lovely everyday tension in episode 11 that really makes it a solid penultimate episode.

Leadale can't seem to decide if it wants to be a compelling mystery or just a really basic escapist power fantasy                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 00:30 19 comments                 anime    I swear, “Let the Chaos Begin” (the title of episode 8) is exactly what I muttered as I opened the Funimation tab to stream this episode of Tribe Nine, a show full of Danganronpa expy characters that's quickly lost a lot of its flavor.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 20   Mar  5, 03:30 95 comments                 anime    There may be more than one person's time being measured by Vanitas' dwindling hourglass, and human or vampire, not every body part can be reattached with some bandages and a sling.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 8   Mar  5, 02:30 47 comments                 anime    Arifureta's plot marches forward at breakneck speed...can't things chill a little?                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 21   Mar  5, 01:30 107 comments                 anime    Some moments are crucial to understanding a work, and viewers just aren't getting the full Platinum End experience if they don't see Yuri's totally unhinged, unprompted rant about why it's OK for her to not like gay people.                    ep. review          15 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 8   Mar  4, 01:30 15 comments                 anime    In the midst of this near-comical deployment of what it thinks commentary is, I'll give Tokyo 24th Ward this: You can tell that this is probably the episode they actually took that extra week off to work on.

Can Eren be saved?                    ep. review          31 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ SEASON FINALE   Apr  4, 02:30 31 comments                 anime    Change to the company is coming to the Monster Development Department here in this final episode.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ SEASON FINALE   Apr  3, 01:30 95 comments                 anime    But if this final confrontation does anything apart from solidify Noé's and Vanitas' relationship, that would be to finally make Vanitas start moving forward again.                    ep. review          36 comments       Love of Kill ‒ SEASON FINALE   Apr  3, 00:30 36 comments                 anime    I don't know if this is all handled differently in the source material but that final shot of Château and Ryang-ha squaring off against this organization didn't exactly make me excited for future installments.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ SEASON FINALE   Apr  2, 01:30 47 comments                 anime    The series had its growing pains, but Arifureta's second season manages to wrap in a mostly satisfying way.                    ep. review          168 comments       Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ‒ Episode 86   Apr  2, 00:30 168 comments                 anime    “Retrospective” features some of the goriest and impressively choreographed action that The Final Season has ever delivered, and every character gets a moment to shine.                    ep. review          15 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 11   Mar 31, 23:30 15 comments                 anime    Would this anime have actually worked if it was a video game instead?                    ep. review          27 comments       Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 31, 05:30 27 comments                 anime    “March 14th” is one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime.                    ep. review          48 comments       Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 31, 03:30 48 comments                 anime    Fantasy Knockout reminds its viewers that it's important to tell your friends that you care about them...and maybe a little more.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 31, 02:30 89 comments                 anime    Wein is facing a war that Natra cannot hope to win and that is the crux of his latest genius plan—well, one of them at least.                    ep. review          81 comments       Akebi's Sailor Uniform ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 06:30 81 comments                 anime    Episode 12 feels like a celebration of three months with the world's most charming middle schooler                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 05:30 19 comments                 anime    I love a last-minute heel turn (with GUNS!), even if it's crammed into twenty-four minutes of not the best paced scripting. But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 04:30 18 comments                 anime    In Slow Loop's naturally gentle way, an empty photo album becomes a perfect way to hint at a new adventure: picking out pictures from the past few seasons together to fill the album with not just as sisters, but as friends.                    ep. review          76 comments       Princess Connect! Re:Dive Season 2 ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 03:30 76 comments                 anime    This, the final episode of Princess Connect! Re:Dive, is a roller coaster.                    ep. review          58 comments       Sasaki and Miyano ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 02:30 58 comments                 anime    This entire episode is a single-minded lead-up to the confession scene we've been waiting weeks to see.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 01:30 51 comments                 anime    After last week's stunner, there aren't a whole lot of surprises left in Sabikui Bisco's bag of tricks, but it doesn't need them to pull together a satisfying and highly fungal finale.                    ep. review          42 comments       Requiem of the Rose King ‒ Episode 12   Mar 30, 00:30 42 comments                 anime    Now we approach the winter of our discontent as we see Richard turn to violence, which has become his go-to method for coping with things he can't actually handle.                    ep. review          31 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ Episode 11   Mar 29, 02:30 31 comments                 anime    Miss Kuroitsu has routinely turned in great comedic episodes, but this one felt exceptionally mediocre for a series approaching its finale.                    ep. review          145 comments       How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 ‒ Episode 12   Mar 29, 01:30 145 comments                 anime    There's really no getting around it: I found the first half of this episode bizarre and dull.                    ep. review          341 comments       My Dress-Up Darling ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 28, 23:30 341 comments                 anime    This episode cements My Dress-Up Darling as a romance about two characters coming into their own all along and makes for one of the best season finales one could hope for.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 23   Mar 26, 05:30 95 comments                 anime    Mikhaïl's machinations are pushing Noé and Vanitas into a position they may not be able to recover from. Like Vanitas' hourglass, all the sand is in one section.

Then, all of a sudden, here comes Teasing Master Takagi-san, hell-bent on getting my grinchy ol' heart to grow three sizes in the middle of freaking March.                    ep. review          31 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 03:30 31 comments                 anime    I'm thoroughly convinced it's Megistus who is the secret sauce. The dude is basically the walking embodiment of a single great joke, that of a villainous commander actually being an excellent, caring boss.                    ep. review          36 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 02:30 36 comments                 anime    We've got another death fake-out this week, but this one felt inexcusably lazy.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 01:30 45 comments                 anime    I've been pretty harsh on In the Land of Leadale for the majority of its run, and a lot of that comes down to the show's identity crisis. Leadale can't seem to decide if it wants to be a compelling mystery or just a really basic escapist power fantasy                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 00:30 19 comments                 anime    I swear, “Let the Chaos Begin” (the title of episode 8) is exactly what I muttered as I opened the Funimation tab to stream this episode of Tribe Nine, a show full of Danganronpa expy characters that's quickly lost a lot of its flavor.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 20   Mar  5, 03:30 95 comments                 anime    There may be more than one person's time being measured by Vanitas' dwindling hourglass, and human or vampire, not every body part can be reattached with some bandages and a sling.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 8   Mar  5, 02:30 47 comments                 anime    Arifureta's plot marches forward at breakneck speed...can't things chill a little?                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 21   Mar  5, 01:30 107 comments                 anime    Some moments are crucial to understanding a work, and viewers just aren't getting the full Platinum End experience if they don't see Yuri's totally unhinged, unprompted rant about why it's OK for her to not like gay people.                    ep. review          15 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 8   Mar  4, 01:30 15 comments                 anime    In the midst of this near-comical deployment of what it thinks commentary is, I'll give Tokyo 24th Ward this: You can tell that this is probably the episode they actually took that extra week off to work on.

But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 04:30 18 comments                 anime    In Slow Loop's naturally gentle way, an empty photo album becomes a perfect way to hint at a new adventure: picking out pictures from the past few seasons together to fill the album with not just as sisters, but as friends.                    ep. review          76 comments       Princess Connect!

Like Vanitas' hourglass, all the sand is in one section.

Then, all of a sudden, here comes Teasing Master Takagi-san, hell-bent on getting my grinchy ol' heart to grow three sizes in the middle of freaking March.                    ep. review          31 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 03:30 31 comments                 anime    I'm thoroughly convinced it's Megistus who is the secret sauce. The dude is basically the walking embodiment of a single great joke, that of a villainous commander actually being an excellent, caring boss.                    ep. review          36 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 02:30 36 comments                 anime    We've got another death fake-out this week, but this one felt inexcusably lazy.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 01:30 45 comments                 anime    I've been pretty harsh on In the Land of Leadale for the majority of its run, and a lot of that comes down to the show's identity crisis. Leadale can't seem to decide if it wants to be a compelling mystery or just a really basic escapist power fantasy                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 00:30 19 comments                 anime    I swear, “Let the Chaos Begin” (the title of episode 8) is exactly what I muttered as I opened the Funimation tab to stream this episode of Tribe Nine, a show full of Danganronpa expy characters that's quickly lost a lot of its flavor.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 20   Mar  5, 03:30 95 comments                 anime    There may be more than one person's time being measured by Vanitas' dwindling hourglass, and human or vampire, not every body part can be reattached with some bandages and a sling.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 8   Mar  5, 02:30 47 comments                 anime    Arifureta's plot marches forward at breakneck speed...can't things chill a little?                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 21   Mar  5, 01:30 107 comments                 anime    Some moments are crucial to understanding a work, and viewers just aren't getting the full Platinum End experience if they don't see Yuri's totally unhinged, unprompted rant about why it's OK for her to not like gay people.                    ep. review          15 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 8   Mar  4, 01:30 15 comments                 anime    In the midst of this near-comical deployment of what it thinks commentary is, I'll give Tokyo 24th Ward this: You can tell that this is probably the episode they actually took that extra week off to work on.

But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 04:30 18 comments                 anime    In Slow Loop's naturally gentle way, an empty photo album becomes a perfect way to hint at a new adventure: picking out pictures from the past few seasons together to fill the album with not just as sisters, but as friends.                    ep. review          76 comments       Princess Connect!

Re:Dive, is a roller coaster.                    ep. review          58 comments       Sasaki and Miyano ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 02:30 58 comments                 anime    This entire episode is a single-minded lead-up to the confession scene we've been waiting weeks to see.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 01:30 51 comments                 anime    After last week's stunner, there aren't a whole lot of surprises left in Sabikui Bisco's bag of tricks, but it doesn't need them to pull together a satisfying and highly fungal finale.                    ep. review          42 comments       Requiem of the Rose King ‒ Episode 12   Mar 30, 00:30 42 comments                 anime    Now we approach the winter of our discontent as we see Richard turn to violence, which has become his go-to method for coping with things he can't actually handle.                    ep. review          31 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ Episode 11   Mar 29, 02:30 31 comments                 anime    Miss Kuroitsu has routinely turned in great comedic episodes, but this one felt exceptionally mediocre for a series approaching its finale.                    ep. review          145 comments       How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 ‒ Episode 12   Mar 29, 01:30 145 comments                 anime    There's really no getting around it: I found the first half of this episode bizarre and dull.                    ep. review          341 comments       My Dress-Up Darling ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 28, 23:30 341 comments                 anime    This episode cements My Dress-Up Darling as a romance about two characters coming into their own all along and makes for one of the best season finales one could hope for.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 23   Mar 26, 05:30 95 comments                 anime    Mikhaïl's machinations are pushing Noé and Vanitas into a position they may not be able to recover from. Like Vanitas' hourglass, all the sand is in one section. Maybe it's time to flip it over and start moving.                    ep. review          36 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 11   Mar 26, 04:30 36 comments                 anime    We have one final episode left and I’m starting to have trepidation that the conclusion won’t be as satisfactory as I think I wanted it to but at least it might end up satiating my curiosity.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 26, 03:30 45 comments                 anime    Here we are at the true proper conclusion of the land of Leadale and… I still have no idea what this show was trying to do or even who it was for.                    ep. review          177 comments       Ranking of Kings ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 26, 02:30 177 comments                 anime    The series often showed that while the world includes unimaginable depths of cruelty, a community can still be forged in empathy and kindness. I think all of us need to know that.                    ep. review          81 comments       Akebi's Sailor Uniform ‒ Episodes 10-11   Mar 26, 01:30 81 comments                 anime    There's this lovely everyday tension in episode 11 that really makes it a solid penultimate episode.

Leadale can't seem to decide if it wants to be a compelling mystery or just a really basic escapist power fantasy                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 00:30 19 comments                 anime    I swear, “Let the Chaos Begin” (the title of episode 8) is exactly what I muttered as I opened the Funimation tab to stream this episode of Tribe Nine, a show full of Danganronpa expy characters that's quickly lost a lot of its flavor.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 20   Mar  5, 03:30 95 comments                 anime    There may be more than one person's time being measured by Vanitas' dwindling hourglass, and human or vampire, not every body part can be reattached with some bandages and a sling.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 8   Mar  5, 02:30 47 comments                 anime    Arifureta's plot marches forward at breakneck speed...can't things chill a little?                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 21   Mar  5, 01:30 107 comments                 anime    Some moments are crucial to understanding a work, and viewers just aren't getting the full Platinum End experience if they don't see Yuri's totally unhinged, unprompted rant about why it's OK for her to not like gay people.                    ep. review          15 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 8   Mar  4, 01:30 15 comments                 anime    In the midst of this near-comical deployment of what it thinks commentary is, I'll give Tokyo 24th Ward this: You can tell that this is probably the episode they actually took that extra week off to work on.

But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 04:30 18 comments                 anime    In Slow Loop's naturally gentle way, an empty photo album becomes a perfect way to hint at a new adventure: picking out pictures from the past few seasons together to fill the album with not just as sisters, but as friends.                    ep. review          76 comments       Princess Connect!

Like Vanitas' hourglass, all the sand is in one section. Maybe it's time to flip it over and start moving.                    ep. review          36 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 11   Mar 26, 04:30 36 comments                 anime    We have one final episode left and I’m starting to have trepidation that the conclusion won’t be as satisfactory as I think I wanted it to but at least it might end up satiating my curiosity.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 26, 03:30 45 comments                 anime    Here we are at the true proper conclusion of the land of Leadale and… I still have no idea what this show was trying to do or even who it was for.                    ep. review          177 comments       Ranking of Kings ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 26, 02:30 177 comments                 anime    The series often showed that while the world includes unimaginable depths of cruelty, a community can still be forged in empathy and kindness. I think all of us need to know that.                    ep. review          81 comments       Akebi's Sailor Uniform ‒ Episodes 10-11   Mar 26, 01:30 81 comments                 anime    There's this lovely everyday tension in episode 11 that really makes it a solid penultimate episode. It's subtle, almost mundane, yet is the cream of slice of life this season because of the emotionality of Komichi's world.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 11   Mar 26, 00:30 47 comments                 anime    Eri reveals her big plot and what set her on the path of villainy this week.                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ SERIES FINALE   Mar 25, 23:30 107 comments                 anime    Y'know, in hindsight, maybe electing a suicidal 12-year-old to become God was a bad idea.                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ Episode 11   Mar 25, 03:30 18 comments                 anime    Slow Loop brings us a Koi-centric episode that's all about reminiscing while in the moment.                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 11   Mar 25, 02:30 19 comments                 anime    Our lord and savior Lord Ojiro is ready to make an appearance after definitely doing a murder, but first, it Minato Tribe must be deemed worthy enough to face off against our bemasked liege.                    ep. review          48 comments       Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout ‒ Episode 11   Mar 25, 01:30 48 comments                 anime    Now that Vizzd and Maid-chan have dropped the act and revealed their evil intentions, I'm glad to report they're just as funny – and stupid – as our heroes.                    ep. review          15 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 10   Mar 25, 00:30 15 comments                 anime    At this point you don't need me to keep coming in and telling you that Tokyo 24th Ward's sociopolitical analyses are as fundamentally broken as the corpse-powered computer at the center of its narrative.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ Episode 11   Mar 24, 01:30 51 comments                 anime    The season's climactic battle against the reanimated and Kurokawa-possessed Tetsujin continues into its second week, with both predictable and surprising developments.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ Episode 11   Mar 24, 00:30 89 comments                 anime    Now that we're in the middle of the final arc of the season, we get introduced to another flaw of our titular genius prince: his lack of experience.                    ep. review          145 comments       How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 ‒ Episode 11   Mar 23, 01:30 145 comments                 anime    How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom addresses a refugee crisis and childbirth in one episode with mixed results.                    ep. review          76 comments       Princess Connect!

Like Vanitas' hourglass, all the sand is in one section. Maybe it's time to flip it over and start moving.                    ep. review          36 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 11   Mar 26, 04:30 36 comments                 anime    We have one final episode left and I’m starting to have trepidation that the conclusion won’t be as satisfactory as I think I wanted it to but at least it might end up satiating my curiosity.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 26, 03:30 45 comments                 anime    Here we are at the true proper conclusion of the land of Leadale and… I still have no idea what this show was trying to do or even who it was for.                    ep. review          177 comments       Ranking of Kings ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 26, 02:30 177 comments                 anime    The series often showed that while the world includes unimaginable depths of cruelty, a community can still be forged in empathy and kindness. I think all of us need to know that.                    ep. review          81 comments       Akebi's Sailor Uniform ‒ Episodes 10-11   Mar 26, 01:30 81 comments                 anime    There's this lovely everyday tension in episode 11 that really makes it a solid penultimate episode. It's subtle, almost mundane, yet is the cream of slice of life this season because of the emotionality of Komichi's world.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 11   Mar 26, 00:30 47 comments                 anime    Eri reveals her big plot and what set her on the path of villainy this week.                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ SERIES FINALE   Mar 25, 23:30 107 comments                 anime    Y'know, in hindsight, maybe electing a suicidal 12-year-old to become God was a bad idea.                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ Episode 11   Mar 25, 03:30 18 comments                 anime    Slow Loop brings us a Koi-centric episode that's all about reminiscing while in the moment.                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 11   Mar 25, 02:30 19 comments                 anime    Our lord and savior Lord Ojiro is ready to make an appearance after definitely doing a murder, but first, it Minato Tribe must be deemed worthy enough to face off against our bemasked liege.                    ep. review          48 comments       Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout ‒ Episode 11   Mar 25, 01:30 48 comments                 anime    Now that Vizzd and Maid-chan have dropped the act and revealed their evil intentions, I'm glad to report they're just as funny – and stupid – as our heroes.                    ep. review          15 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 10   Mar 25, 00:30 15 comments                 anime    At this point you don't need me to keep coming in and telling you that Tokyo 24th Ward's sociopolitical analyses are as fundamentally broken as the corpse-powered computer at the center of its narrative.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ Episode 11   Mar 24, 01:30 51 comments                 anime    The season's climactic battle against the reanimated and Kurokawa-possessed Tetsujin continues into its second week, with both predictable and surprising developments.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ Episode 11   Mar 24, 00:30 89 comments                 anime    Now that we're in the middle of the final arc of the season, we get introduced to another flaw of our titular genius prince: his lack of experience.                    ep. review          145 comments       How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 ‒ Episode 11   Mar 23, 01:30 145 comments                 anime    How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom addresses a refugee crisis and childbirth in one episode with mixed results.                    ep. review          76 comments       Princess Connect!

I've been half-joking that the bad guys were evil feminists all along, but the show is tantalizingly close to making that its explicit reality.                    ep. review          27 comments       Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 ‒ Episode 10   Mar 15, 01:30 27 comments                 anime    This week's episode was great but it just didn't melt my heart into a puddle of pure syrup to be poured into a batter baked into a seven-layer “Dawwwwwwwwww” cake. There are much worse problems to have.                    ep. review          36 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 9   Mar 15, 00:30 36 comments                 anime    The curtain to the show's prevailing mysteries are finally starting to be pulled back, and some of the revelations we get this episode are very intriguing.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ Episode 10   Mar 14, 23:30 45 comments                 anime    Cayna's characterization in recent episodes have brought out the quirky, doting motherly side that I think Leadale has always been trying to show but got lost in her unjustified anger-filled outbursts.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 21   Mar 12, 03:30 95 comments                 anime    Louis' death affected more people than just him, and one other very, very specifically: Dominique, his sister.                    ep. review          177 comments       Ranking of Kings ‒ Episodes 20-21   Mar 12, 02:30 177 comments                 anime    I don't think it's an exaggeration to say this series, and this episode in particular, will serve as inspiration for years to come.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 9   Mar 12, 01:30 47 comments                 anime    It's time for another action-centric episode of Arifureta.

Sabikui Bisco certainly wears its influences on its sleeve as it catapults into yet another climax.                    ep. review          48 comments       Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout ‒ Episodes 8-9   Mar 10, 00:30 48 comments                 anime    While there are a few funny moments or chuckle-worthy faces hidden in there, the first half of the episode is just one big joke about how Shen is totally trying to assault Jinguuji, and it's a rough sit.                    ep. review          58 comments       Sasaki and Miyano ‒ Episode 9   Mar  9, 05:30 58 comments                 anime    What started off as largely obligation has become a chance for Miyano to explore his own anxieties about his appearance in a relatively safe – yet still public – situation.                    ep. review          76 comments       Princess Connect!

Leadale can't seem to decide if it wants to be a compelling mystery or just a really basic escapist power fantasy                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 00:30 19 comments                 anime    I swear, “Let the Chaos Begin” (the title of episode 8) is exactly what I muttered as I opened the Funimation tab to stream this episode of Tribe Nine, a show full of Danganronpa expy characters that's quickly lost a lot of its flavor.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 20   Mar  5, 03:30 95 comments                 anime    There may be more than one person's time being measured by Vanitas' dwindling hourglass, and human or vampire, not every body part can be reattached with some bandages and a sling.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 8   Mar  5, 02:30 47 comments                 anime    Arifureta's plot marches forward at breakneck speed...can't things chill a little?                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 21   Mar  5, 01:30 107 comments                 anime    Some moments are crucial to understanding a work, and viewers just aren't getting the full Platinum End experience if they don't see Yuri's totally unhinged, unprompted rant about why it's OK for her to not like gay people.                    ep. review          15 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 8   Mar  4, 01:30 15 comments                 anime    In the midst of this near-comical deployment of what it thinks commentary is, I'll give Tokyo 24th Ward this: You can tell that this is probably the episode they actually took that extra week off to work on.
