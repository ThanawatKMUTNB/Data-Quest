By setting the story in a time and place even more sexist than modern Japan, we end up with a cast of characters who spend the first several episodes being baffled that a girl would attempt to do anything other than bat her eyelashes at potential suitors, which can get repetitive. While this does present strong conflicts for Arte to overcome, the story can come across as being a little too pleased with itself for having her accomplish... well, basically anything.

It's not too much of a blemish on an otherwise engaging story, however, especially when this is one where the protagonist views even falling in love as just another obstacle getting in the way of her career.

Of course he‚Äôs nowhere near normal ‚Äì he‚Äôs the hero of  Jujutsu Kaisen (Âë™Ë°ìÂªªÊà¶, Jujutsu Kaisen), a dark fantasy manga by Gege Akutami (Ëä•Ë¶ã‰∏ã„ÄÖ, Akutami Gege) with a 24-episode anime series by MAPPA. Set in a world where sorcerers must fight deadly curses born of negative emotions,  Jujutsu Kaisen combines its dark premise with a refreshing modern setting, relatable characters and of course, plenty of action. Read on to learn more about the world of  Jujutsu Kaisen, along with its characters, keywords and more! Contents1. Story2. Setting3. Characters- 3.1¬†Jujutsu High students- 3.2 Jujutsu High faculty- 3.3 Antagonists4. Keywords5. Main media- 5.1 Manga- 5.2 TV anime series- 5.3 Anime film StoryDespite being blessed with extraordinary athleticism, fifteen-year-old Yuji Itadori refuses to have anything to do with his high school‚Äôs track team. His choice? The Occult Research Club. However, his world is thrown into chaos when a cursed talisman in the form of a rotting finger is unsealed at school. To protect his friends, Yuji swallows the finger, which is actually a fragment of legendary ""King of Curses"" Ryomen Sukuna, and becomes possessed himself. Although this effectively signs his death warrant, the intervention of powerful sorcerer Satoru Gojo sets him on a different path: to consume the rest of Sukuna‚Äôs fingers so he can destroy the curse ‚Äì and himself ‚Äì forever.  SettingTo be human is to experience not only positive feelings, but also negative emotions like sadness, regret and shame. In  Jujutsu Kaisen, such emotions produce cursed energy, which transforms into curses that can bring misfortune to the world. While normal humans cannot control this, Jujutsu Sorcerers are able to harness their own cursed energy to use certain techniques. With their supernatural powers, these sorcerers secretly protect humans from curses and the threats they pose to society.

Good-natured and always willing to help those around him, Yuji particularly values the importance of life and having a ‚Äúfair death‚Äù, which was instilled in him by his dead grandfather. As a result, he eats Sukuna‚Äôs finger to save his friends and thus becomes the present-day vessel of the ‚ÄúKing of Curses.‚Äù He then enrolls in Jujutsu High to become a sorcerer himself under the tutelage of Satoru Gojo. Through lessons and missions, he learns more about cursed energy and how to control it, boosting his already impressive physical abilities. He is voiced by Junya Enoki (Japanese) and Adam McArthur (English). Megumi Fushiguro (‰ºèÈªíÊÅµ, Fushiguro Megumi)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA first-year student.

The two are later reunited as fellow students under the tutelage of Satoru Gojo. Megumi‚Äôs sorcery talents include summoning Shikigami (spirits) for offense and exorcisms.

She is voiced by Asami Seto (Japanese) and Anne Yatco (English).Maki Zen'in (Á¶™Èô¢ÁúüÂ∏å, Zen'in Maki)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA second-year student who participates in the event with their sister school in Kyoto. Despite being born to a clan of elite Jujutsu Sorcerers, Maki doesn't have the ability to control cursed energy or even see curses. However, she compensates for this with amazing physical strength and talent with all sorts of cursed tools. She is voiced by Mikako Komatsu (Japanese) and Allegra Clark (English).Toge Inumaki (ÁãóÂ∑ªÊ£ò, Inumaki Toge)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA second-year student who participates in the sister school event. His power is channeled through cursed speech ‚Äì words imbued with his cursed energy.

After Yuji is sentenced to death for being possessed by Sukuna, Satoru proposes that they wait until all of the fingers are consumed, which would give them the chance to destroy Sukuna once and for all. He is renowned for his immense power and battle prowess to the point that his self-proclamation of being the world‚Äôs strongest Jujutsu Sorcerer goes unchallenged. He is voiced by Yuichi Nakamura (Japanese) and Kaiji Tang (English).Masamichi Yaga (Â§úËõæÊ≠£ÈÅì, Yaga Masamichi)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteJujutsu High's principal and a passionate educator who once mentored Gojo.

Also translated as ""Double Faced Specter."" Known as the ""King of Curses"", Sukuna resisted all exorcism attempts, driving sorcerers of centuries ago to cut off and hide his 20 fingers in order to seal his power. His character has roots in Japanese legend, with references to a two-faced, 8-armed and 8-legged man with supernatural strength in Nihon Shoki, the second oldest book of Japanese history. He is voiced by Junichi Suwabe (Japanese), and Ray Chase (English).Suguru Geto (Â§èÊ≤π ÂÇë, Get≈ç Suguru)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA Special Grade Jujutsu Sorcerer who wishes to transform the world into a ""paradise"" that would house sorcerers only.

Keywords ‚Äì¬†Curses (Âë™„ÅÑ, noroi) / Cursed Spirits (Âë™Èúä, jurei) Spiritual beings given form by cursed energy (see below). Particularly likely to manifest in places like hospitals and schools, they are the cause of countless mysterious deaths and disappearances in general society, with regular people unable to see them. However, Jujutsu Sorcerers are able to see, fight and exorcise them. Curses vary greatly in appearance and power, and are ranked by strength with Grades 1-4 (4 being the weakest) and Special Grade (the very strongest). They may also be sealed in artifacts as Sukuna was, becoming cursed objects (Âë™Áâ©, jubutsu) that can still emit cursed energy.  ‚Äì¬†Cursed Energy (Âë™Âäõ, juryoku)A form of energy that arises from humans‚Äô negative emotions, like hate, regret, and shame, and gives form to curses. While regular people are unable to control it, Jujutsu Sorcerers (see below) and curses are able to harness their own cursed energy for combat.  ‚Äì¬†Jujutsu Sorcerer (Âë™Ë°ìÂ∏´, jujutsu-shi)Individuals who have been trained to combat curses using Jujutsu spells and techniques at one of Japan‚Äôs two recognized Jujutsu educational institutions. They are tasked with various missions, the difficulty of which should match their grade as a sorcerer, with Grade 4 being the lowest and Special Grade being the highest. These duties may involve exorcising curses, investigating curse-related incidents, and so on.  ‚Äì¬†Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School (Êù±‰∫¨ÈÉΩÁ´ãÂë™Ë°ìÈ´òÁ≠âÂ∞ÇÈñÄÂ≠¶Ê†°, T≈çkyo Toritsu Jujutsu Senmon Gakk≈ç)A 4-year institution where aspiring Jujutsu Sorcerers gather to train their craft.

One of Japan‚Äôs only two Jujutsu schools, it is located in the suburbs of Tokyo, with the other (its sister school) located in Kyoto. However, it is disguised as a religious school and is further hidden and protected from outside threats by a protective barrier. It is common for fully-fledged sorcerers to come back to Jujutsu High to teach students, as well as manage and support missions.

His choice? The Occult Research Club. However, his world is thrown into chaos when a cursed talisman in the form of a rotting finger is unsealed at school. To protect his friends, Yuji swallows the finger, which is actually a fragment of legendary ""King of Curses"" Ryomen Sukuna, and becomes possessed himself.

While normal humans cannot control this, Jujutsu Sorcerers are able to harness their own cursed energy to use certain techniques. With their supernatural powers, these sorcerers secretly protect humans from curses and the threats they pose to society.

As a result, he eats Sukuna‚Äôs finger to save his friends and thus becomes the present-day vessel of the ‚ÄúKing of Curses.‚Äù He then enrolls in Jujutsu High to become a sorcerer himself under the tutelage of Satoru Gojo. Through lessons and missions, he learns more about cursed energy and how to control it, boosting his already impressive physical abilities. He is voiced by Junya Enoki (Japanese) and Adam McArthur (English). Megumi Fushiguro (‰ºèÈªíÊÅµ, Fushiguro Megumi)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA first-year student. Megumi‚Äôs search for a cursed object leads him to meet Yuji and witness his self-sacrifice first-hand, despite them being strangers. Secretive and calculating, he nevertheless believes in helping those who are good and kind, as seen when he vouches for Yuji in the face of the latter‚Äôs impending execution. The two are later reunited as fellow students under the tutelage of Satoru Gojo. Megumi‚Äôs sorcery talents include summoning Shikigami (spirits) for offense and exorcisms. He is voiced by Yuma Uchida (Japanese) and Robbie Daymond (English).Nobara Kugisaki (ÈáòÂ¥éÈáéËñîËñá, Kugisaki Nobara)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA first-year student hailing from the country. As one of Satoru‚Äôs students, she teams up with Yuji and Megumi for various missions. Self-confident and quick to speak her mind, she takes pride in her own identity, abilities and appearance. Nobara‚Äôs distinctive battle style includes the use of hammers and nails infused with cursed energy.  She is voiced by Asami Seto (Japanese) and Anne Yatco (English).Maki Zen'in (Á¶™Èô¢ÁúüÂ∏å, Zen'in Maki)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA second-year student who participates in the event with their sister school in Kyoto. Despite being born to a clan of elite Jujutsu Sorcerers, Maki doesn't have the ability to control cursed energy or even see curses. However, she compensates for this with amazing physical strength and talent with all sorts of cursed tools. She is voiced by Mikako Komatsu (Japanese) and Allegra Clark (English).Toge Inumaki (ÁãóÂ∑ªÊ£ò, Inumaki Toge)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA second-year student who participates in the sister school event. His power is channeled through cursed speech ‚Äì words imbued with his cursed energy. To ensure that his abilities don't affect people in everyday situations, he only uses words that can be fillings for rice balls. He is voiced by Koki Uchiyama (Japanese) and Xander Mobus (English).Panda („Éë„É≥„ÉÄ, Panda)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA second-year student who participates in the sister school event with Maki and Toge.

After Yuji is sentenced to death for being possessed by Sukuna, Satoru proposes that they wait until all of the fingers are consumed, which would give them the chance to destroy Sukuna once and for all. He is renowned for his immense power and battle prowess to the point that his self-proclamation of being the world‚Äôs strongest Jujutsu Sorcerer goes unchallenged. He is voiced by Yuichi Nakamura (Japanese) and Kaiji Tang (English).Masamichi Yaga (Â§úËõæÊ≠£ÈÅì, Yaga Masamichi)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteJujutsu High's principal and a passionate educator who once mentored Gojo.

Also translated as ""Double Faced Specter."" Known as the ""King of Curses"", Sukuna resisted all exorcism attempts, driving sorcerers of centuries ago to cut off and hide his 20 fingers in order to seal his power. His character has roots in Japanese legend, with references to a two-faced, 8-armed and 8-legged man with supernatural strength in Nihon Shoki, the second oldest book of Japanese history. He is voiced by Junichi Suwabe (Japanese), and Ray Chase (English).Suguru Geto (Â§èÊ≤π ÂÇë, Get≈ç Suguru)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA Special Grade Jujutsu Sorcerer who wishes to transform the world into a ""paradise"" that would house sorcerers only. He is voiced by Takahiro Sakurai (Japanese) and Lex Lang (English).Jogo (ÊºèÁëö, J≈çgo)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA powerful curse born of fear of the earth. He believes that his own kind is humanity's true form because cursed spirits originate from pure emotion, as opposed to humans and their false emotions. He is voiced by Shigeru Chiba (Japanese) and Michael Sorich (English).Hanami (Ëä±Âæ°, Hanami)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA powerful curse born of fear of the forests. They wish to eliminate humans so they stop hurting the environment. They are voiced by Atsuko Tanaka. Keywords ‚Äì¬†Curses (Âë™„ÅÑ, noroi) / Cursed Spirits (Âë™Èúä, jurei) Spiritual beings given form by cursed energy (see below). Particularly likely to manifest in places like hospitals and schools, they are the cause of countless mysterious deaths and disappearances in general society, with regular people unable to see them. However, Jujutsu Sorcerers are able to see, fight and exorcise them. Curses vary greatly in appearance and power, and are ranked by strength with Grades 1-4 (4 being the weakest) and Special Grade (the very strongest). They may also be sealed in artifacts as Sukuna was, becoming cursed objects (Âë™Áâ©, jubutsu) that can still emit cursed energy.  ‚Äì¬†Cursed Energy (Âë™Âäõ, juryoku)A form of energy that arises from humans‚Äô negative emotions, like hate, regret, and shame, and gives form to curses. While regular people are unable to control it, Jujutsu Sorcerers (see below) and curses are able to harness their own cursed energy for combat.  ‚Äì¬†Jujutsu Sorcerer (Âë™Ë°ìÂ∏´, jujutsu-shi)Individuals who have been trained to combat curses using Jujutsu spells and techniques at one of Japan‚Äôs two recognized Jujutsu educational institutions. They are tasked with various missions, the difficulty of which should match their grade as a sorcerer, with Grade 4 being the lowest and Special Grade being the highest. These duties may involve exorcising curses, investigating curse-related incidents, and so on.  ‚Äì¬†Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School (Êù±‰∫¨ÈÉΩÁ´ãÂë™Ë°ìÈ´òÁ≠âÂ∞ÇÈñÄÂ≠¶Ê†°, T≈çkyo Toritsu Jujutsu Senmon Gakk≈ç)A 4-year institution where aspiring Jujutsu Sorcerers gather to train their craft. It can also be translated as Tokyo Metropolitan Magic Technical School and abbreviated as Jujutsu High. One of Japan‚Äôs only two Jujutsu schools, it is located in the suburbs of Tokyo, with the other (its sister school) located in Kyoto. However, it is disguised as a religious school and is further hidden and protected from outside threats by a protective barrier. It is common for fully-fledged sorcerers to come back to Jujutsu High to teach students, as well as manage and support missions.

A warning will be displayed before any spoilers are mentioned, so rest assured that you can read this article even if you haven‚Äôt watched it yet!Fantasy anime  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba has taken not only Japan, but the entire world by storm. On October 16, 2020, a sequel,  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train, was released in Japan. In just 10 days, it earned over 100 billion yen in box office revenues, the fastest movie to have ever done so in Japan, and the two month mark saw it go past a whopping 300 million yen. If that wasn't enough, it even overtook  Studio Ghibli's  Spirited Away, previously the highest-grossing film in Japanese history - yet another record set at blazing speeds!Along with this wave of popularity, manga volumes and general  KnY merchandise has been selling out everywhere. Regardless of age and gender, the franchise has truly attracted passionate fans far and wide.Penned by a TOM Staff member and true  KnY fan who‚Äôs gone to see  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train an unbelievable 16 times, this article will introduce nine of its highlights - in other words, nine reasons to go and watch it when it's available where you are. Get ready to engage in some Total Concentration Reading!First, let‚Äôs talk about the background behind  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train. The original manga,  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba, tells the story of Tanjiro Kamado, a boy who embarks on a quest to heal his sister Nezuko, who has been transformed into a demon. During this journey, he and his companions must face intense battles against evil demons.  Mugen Train covers the 7th and 8th volumes of the manga. In terms of the TV anime series, the movie follows on from the story of the 26th and last episode, ‚ÄúNew Mission.‚Äù If you haven‚Äôt seen the TV anime yet, I recommend watching it first. For some quick information on the plot, setting, and key vocab, check out our guide to Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba!Now, watch closely‚Ä¶ and pay attention to these highlights! 1. Unbelievably Beautiful VisualsWhen it first came out, the TV anime's stunning animation and breathtaking battle scenes went viral. Of course, these high standards were maintained in the movie as well. Seeing those amazing battle scenes on the big screen was particularly overwhelming! The sheer speed made me feel like I was running through the screen with Tanjiro and the others, while the ominous figures of their enemies, the demons, had me shivering‚Ä¶ From the first scene of the advancing Mugen Train to the credits, you can dive right into the world of  KnY through the spectacular animation. And it‚Äôs not just the battle scenes ‚Äì charming country landscapes, the train‚Äôs striking interior, snowy mountains, the Rengoku family‚Äôs traditional Japanese house‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs just so much to enjoy in this amazing movie, produced by ufotable, a studio whose animation of katana and Japanese architechture has been well received in anime like  Touken Ranbu and much more. Be sure to look out for the backgrounds, too! Here‚Äôs a tip: each of the fusuma, or sliding doors, have especially elaborate designs.  2. The Flame Hashira: The One and Only Kyojuro RengokuOne thing I want ‚Äì or actually, need you to pay attention to is the second protagonist of Mugen Train: Kyojuro Rengoku, the Demon Slayer Corps‚Äô Flame Hashira. Many people may have been surprised at Kyojuro‚Äôs first appearance in the anime series ‚Äì the moment he lays eyes upon Nezuko, already a demon, and Tanjiro, who brought her, he orders that she be decapitated. This paints him as quite an unreasonable person who won‚Äôt even stop for an explanation first, but we go on to learn so much more about him. A son of the Rengoku family and its historic Fire Hashira lineage, we see his gentle soul, strength, and unwavering heart and convictions, as well as the loneliness that follows a man of his nature. All of this is sure to draw you to him as a character. At the beginning of Episode 24 of the anime series, Kyojuro is seen talking with Shinobu Kocho (the Insect Hashira) about his upcoming mission on the Mugen Train. He didn‚Äôt receive any battle scenes during the series, so the movie is the first time we actually get to see him and his Flame Breathing techniques in action. The flames that roar through the train, his unbelievably swift reactions, the movement of his cape, his intense red eyes that seem to see through all‚Ä¶Everything. Is. Way. Too. Cool.Seriously, everything about him is just so cool‚Ä¶ How am I meant to deal with this‚Ä¶ (I mean, I don‚Äôt have to.) The moment he began his Flame Breathing First Form: Shiranui, I realized, ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôve pretty much spent nothing on this movie‚Ä¶ This is already worth the ticket‚Ä¶‚ÄùFrom his sword techniques to his mere presence and words, every part of Rengoku Kyojuro is priceless. Honestly, this movie leaves you no time to even blink. Everything is something to look out for. I don‚Äôt want you to let even a tenth of a second escape your attention, so be sure to use plenty of eye drops before it starts 3. The Mugen Train and its Real-Life OriginsLet‚Äôs take a look at a certain train otaku favorite in Japan, SL Hitoyoshi, which features an 8620 Class steam locomotive. Commonly known as ‚Äúhachiroku"" (meaning ""86‚Äù), it‚Äôs none other than the locomotive that inspired the appearance of the Mugen Train! From the beginning of the movie, we get plenty of glimpses at Japan in the Taisho Era (1912-1926), from the design of the station and passenger cars to the fashion of the passengers themselves. Through the animation, we also experience its sheer speed, as well as the actual sensation of being swayed as we ride in the heavy carriages. It‚Äôs downright awesome!Here in Japan, we actually got to see a collaboration between SL Hitoyoshi and  KnY, where the locomotive was transformed into a real-life Mugen Train for a limited run. Naturally, it was so popular that it was practically impossible to get your hands on tickets. (Yup, I didn‚Äôt manage to snag any either‚Ä¶) It quickly became a viral topic on social media, with people excited to see a ‚Äúreal-life Mugen Train‚Äù even in photos and videos.  4. Tanjiro‚Äôs Feelings For His FamilyKnY‚Äôs story begins with a powerful theme: family. We also see its importance in the movie, which beautifully illustrates Tanjiro‚Äôs feelings for his family. He‚Äôs already lost so many people important to him, but no matter how much he wants to return to those happy days, there‚Äôs no going back ‚Äì he'll never be able to see his loved ones again. This movie‚Äôs depiction of Tanjiro‚Äôs family, entangled in memories both happy and sad, but never to be restored, will have your eyes streaming with tears. 5. And Of Course, the Funny Scenes!Another great element that we get to see again are the hilarious moments between Inosuke and Zenitsu! You‚Äôll also find yourself chuckling at Rengoku as he scarfs down his ekiben (bento lunches bought at train stations). Another heads up ‚Äì at first Zenitsu‚Äôs dream sequence will probably just seem funny, but if you pay attention to where it‚Äôs set, that smile might turn into tears‚Ä¶ (This is especially aimed at anyone who‚Äôs already read the manga up to the Mugen Train arc ‚Äì I want you to think long and hard about where he is in that dream!) Spoiler Alert!From here, I‚Äôll be introducing specific details about the movie, so please stop reading if you want to avoid spoilers.‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚ÜìAlright! Let‚Äôs keep going with more highlights, including actual scenes from the movie! 6. An Unprecedented Battle of IntellectTanjiro‚Äôs new foe, and the demon controlling the Mugen Train is Enmu, Lower Rank One in the Twelve Kizuki. Before the events of the movie, Muzan himself took a liking to Enmu and gifted him with Muzan‚Äôs blood. Having gained power with this infusion, Enmu decides to enlist the help of humans ‚Äì or rather, use them as a means for his plan. Thus, the lives of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, Nezuko, and their mission companion, Rengoku, as well as the train‚Äôs many regular passengers, are Enmu‚Äôs next targets. His gentle and calm manner of speaking and friendly smile prove to make him an even more sinister character. Carrying out his plan with meticulous care, Enmu attempts to put Tanjiro and the other humans to sleep forever through his Blood Demon Art, a style of attack that they‚Äôve never faced before. How will Tanjiro and his fellow Demon Slayers wake themselves up from Enmu‚Äôs eternal dreams? 7. The Sudden Appearance of Upper Rank Three, AkazaThe last part of the movie takes a huge turn with the sudden appearance of Akaza (Upper Rank Three) and his fierce battle against Rengoku. Just before dawn, Tanjiro and the others finally get the chance to breathe a sigh of relief, having defeated Enmu and checked that the passengers are safe. But this only lasts for a moment, with the Demon Slayers gathered facing the dreaded Upper Rank Three for the first time. The sudden roaring sound signals the appearance of something... but then dies down, leaving an eerie silence. Then, a pair of eyes glisten in the darkness. This frightening sense of anticipation crosses the screen to weigh down on you, causing you to instinctively clench your fists in suspense‚Ä¶Despite Akaza being a favorite among  KnY‚Äôs many demons, we didn‚Äôt get any information on his voice actor, or even still images until the movie‚Äôs official release. As a result, fans speculated that the movie might only cover Enmu‚Äôs arc and stop before showing Akaza, or that the anime series would continue with his story. However, the movie‚Äôs premiere date came and the cat was finally let out of the bag. We now know that Akaza‚Äôs voice actor is Akira Ishida, famous for roles like Kaworu Nagisa in  Neon Genesis Evangelion! This casting was a huge yet welcome surprise for fans. If you‚Äôre watching the movie with Japanese audio, be sure to soak up every moment of Akaza‚Äôs malevolence, madness and despair through Ishida‚Äôs formidable voice acting!One more highlight is the overwhelming energy of Rengoku and Akaza in their battle scenes, yet another part where you can‚Äôt afford to blink. If IMAX screenings are available near you, take advantage of them and experience the fight‚Äôs sheer power at full volume. It goes without saying that you can still experience plenty at normal theaters, but I urge you to go and feel the huge impact behind each and every hit at IMAX volume levels! The depiction of the snowflake patterns in Akaza‚Äôs Technique Deployment ability is also a highlight. In the original manga‚Äôs 18th volume, we learn about Akaza‚Äôs past. Despite being a ruthless demon with numerous victims, the sorrows of his life as a human capture the pity of readers. Personally, he‚Äôs one of my favorite characters. After watching the movie, I also recommend going right to the rest of the manga to continue the story! 8. Tears of FrustrationAt the end of the battle, Tanjiro and his companions are overwhelmed by the realization that they are still too weak, no matter how much work they put in or how hard they train. Sneering down with their seemingly infinite power are the demons. Haunted by the thought that they couldn‚Äôt do anything, that they had to be protected by others, the young humans have faced frustration, sadness, and uncontrollable tears. For the sake of their slain family members and beloved people they still had to protect, they‚Äôve trained over and over, fought to survive the Final Selection, narrowly escaped death every night, and made huge progress. Yet their power was still nowhere near enough. And now, the man they had followed has fallen victim to their enemies. No matter how many times you watch the movie, this realization will tear your heart to shreds. In the face of such a tragedy, Inosuke offers some words that are deeply touching. His upbringing among wild boars may have given him less experience with other people, but we can see that he‚Äôs grown yet again as a human.  9. Rengoku‚Äôs Explosive Battle Through LifeFans who have already read the manga will know what I‚Äôm talking about. In any case, I won‚Äôt elaborate too much, but I urge you to burn his battles and his way of life into your mind ‚Äì why he risks his life in battle, why he tries to protect humans. His crystal-clear beliefs and promises will also give you an insight into the loneliness he must bear. Protect the weak. Respect one‚Äôs duty and values. In what light will you see these warriors and hear their words as they fight to protect others? If you have the chance, please find out on the big screen. Finally, let me leave you with these words: ‚ÄúKeep your heart burning!‚Äù (And don‚Äôt forget a handkerchief!)This is a Tokyo Otaku Mode original article with text and illustrations by HER.--Need some more quality time with the KnY crew?

And it‚Äôs not just the battle scenes ‚Äì charming country landscapes, the train‚Äôs striking interior, snowy mountains, the Rengoku family‚Äôs traditional Japanese house‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs just so much to enjoy in this amazing movie, produced by ufotable, a studio whose animation of katana and Japanese architechture has been well received in anime like  Touken Ranbu and much more. Be sure to look out for the backgrounds, too! Here‚Äôs a tip: each of the fusuma, or sliding doors, have especially elaborate designs.  2. The Flame Hashira: The One and Only Kyojuro RengokuOne thing I want ‚Äì or actually, need you to pay attention to is the second protagonist of Mugen Train: Kyojuro Rengoku, the Demon Slayer Corps‚Äô Flame Hashira. Many people may have been surprised at Kyojuro‚Äôs first appearance in the anime series ‚Äì the moment he lays eyes upon Nezuko, already a demon, and Tanjiro, who brought her, he orders that she be decapitated. This paints him as quite an unreasonable person who won‚Äôt even stop for an explanation first, but we go on to learn so much more about him. A son of the Rengoku family and its historic Fire Hashira lineage, we see his gentle soul, strength, and unwavering heart and convictions, as well as the loneliness that follows a man of his nature. All of this is sure to draw you to him as a character. At the beginning of Episode 24 of the anime series, Kyojuro is seen talking with Shinobu Kocho (the Insect Hashira) about his upcoming mission on the Mugen Train. He didn‚Äôt receive any battle scenes during the series, so the movie is the first time we actually get to see him and his Flame Breathing techniques in action. The flames that roar through the train, his unbelievably swift reactions, the movement of his cape, his intense red eyes that seem to see through all‚Ä¶Everything. Is. Way. Too. Cool.Seriously, everything about him is just so cool‚Ä¶ How am I meant to deal with this‚Ä¶ (I mean, I don‚Äôt have to.) The moment he began his Flame Breathing First Form: Shiranui, I realized, ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôve pretty much spent nothing on this movie‚Ä¶ This is already worth the ticket‚Ä¶‚ÄùFrom his sword techniques to his mere presence and words, every part of Rengoku Kyojuro is priceless. Honestly, this movie leaves you no time to even blink. Everything is something to look out for. I don‚Äôt want you to let even a tenth of a second escape your attention, so be sure to use plenty of eye drops before it starts 3. The Mugen Train and its Real-Life OriginsLet‚Äôs take a look at a certain train otaku favorite in Japan, SL Hitoyoshi, which features an 8620 Class steam locomotive. Commonly known as ‚Äúhachiroku"" (meaning ""86‚Äù), it‚Äôs none other than the locomotive that inspired the appearance of the Mugen Train! From the beginning of the movie, we get plenty of glimpses at Japan in the Taisho Era (1912-1926), from the design of the station and passenger cars to the fashion of the passengers themselves. Through the animation, we also experience its sheer speed, as well as the actual sensation of being swayed as we ride in the heavy carriages. It‚Äôs downright awesome!Here in Japan, we actually got to see a collaboration between SL Hitoyoshi and  KnY, where the locomotive was transformed into a real-life Mugen Train for a limited run. Naturally, it was so popular that it was practically impossible to get your hands on tickets. (Yup, I didn‚Äôt manage to snag any either‚Ä¶) It quickly became a viral topic on social media, with people excited to see a ‚Äúreal-life Mugen Train‚Äù even in photos and videos.  4. Tanjiro‚Äôs Feelings For His FamilyKnY‚Äôs story begins with a powerful theme: family. We also see its importance in the movie, which beautifully illustrates Tanjiro‚Äôs feelings for his family. He‚Äôs already lost so many people important to him, but no matter how much he wants to return to those happy days, there‚Äôs no going back ‚Äì he'll never be able to see his loved ones again. This movie‚Äôs depiction of Tanjiro‚Äôs family, entangled in memories both happy and sad, but never to be restored, will have your eyes streaming with tears. 5. And Of Course, the Funny Scenes!Another great element that we get to see again are the hilarious moments between Inosuke and Zenitsu! You‚Äôll also find yourself chuckling at Rengoku as he scarfs down his ekiben (bento lunches bought at train stations). Another heads up ‚Äì at first Zenitsu‚Äôs dream sequence will probably just seem funny, but if you pay attention to where it‚Äôs set, that smile might turn into tears‚Ä¶ (This is especially aimed at anyone who‚Äôs already read the manga up to the Mugen Train arc ‚Äì I want you to think long and hard about where he is in that dream!) Spoiler Alert!From here, I‚Äôll be introducing specific details about the movie, so please stop reading if you want to avoid spoilers.‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚ÜìAlright! Let‚Äôs keep going with more highlights, including actual scenes from the movie! 6. An Unprecedented Battle of IntellectTanjiro‚Äôs new foe, and the demon controlling the Mugen Train is Enmu, Lower Rank One in the Twelve Kizuki. Before the events of the movie, Muzan himself took a liking to Enmu and gifted him with Muzan‚Äôs blood. Having gained power with this infusion, Enmu decides to enlist the help of humans ‚Äì or rather, use them as a means for his plan. Thus, the lives of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, Nezuko, and their mission companion, Rengoku, as well as the train‚Äôs many regular passengers, are Enmu‚Äôs next targets. His gentle and calm manner of speaking and friendly smile prove to make him an even more sinister character. Carrying out his plan with meticulous care, Enmu attempts to put Tanjiro and the other humans to sleep forever through his Blood Demon Art, a style of attack that they‚Äôve never faced before. How will Tanjiro and his fellow Demon Slayers wake themselves up from Enmu‚Äôs eternal dreams? 7. The Sudden Appearance of Upper Rank Three, AkazaThe last part of the movie takes a huge turn with the sudden appearance of Akaza (Upper Rank Three) and his fierce battle against Rengoku. Just before dawn, Tanjiro and the others finally get the chance to breathe a sigh of relief, having defeated Enmu and checked that the passengers are safe. But this only lasts for a moment, with the Demon Slayers gathered facing the dreaded Upper Rank Three for the first time. The sudden roaring sound signals the appearance of something... but then dies down, leaving an eerie silence. Then, a pair of eyes glisten in the darkness. This frightening sense of anticipation crosses the screen to weigh down on you, causing you to instinctively clench your fists in suspense‚Ä¶Despite Akaza being a favorite among  KnY‚Äôs many demons, we didn‚Äôt get any information on his voice actor, or even still images until the movie‚Äôs official release. As a result, fans speculated that the movie might only cover Enmu‚Äôs arc and stop before showing Akaza, or that the anime series would continue with his story. However, the movie‚Äôs premiere date came and the cat was finally let out of the bag. We now know that Akaza‚Äôs voice actor is Akira Ishida, famous for roles like Kaworu Nagisa in  Neon Genesis Evangelion! This casting was a huge yet welcome surprise for fans. If you‚Äôre watching the movie with Japanese audio, be sure to soak up every moment of Akaza‚Äôs malevolence, madness and despair through Ishida‚Äôs formidable voice acting!One more highlight is the overwhelming energy of Rengoku and Akaza in their battle scenes, yet another part where you can‚Äôt afford to blink. If IMAX screenings are available near you, take advantage of them and experience the fight‚Äôs sheer power at full volume. It goes without saying that you can still experience plenty at normal theaters, but I urge you to go and feel the huge impact behind each and every hit at IMAX volume levels! The depiction of the snowflake patterns in Akaza‚Äôs Technique Deployment ability is also a highlight. In the original manga‚Äôs 18th volume, we learn about Akaza‚Äôs past. Despite being a ruthless demon with numerous victims, the sorrows of his life as a human capture the pity of readers. Personally, he‚Äôs one of my favorite characters. After watching the movie, I also recommend going right to the rest of the manga to continue the story! 8. Tears of FrustrationAt the end of the battle, Tanjiro and his companions are overwhelmed by the realization that they are still too weak, no matter how much work they put in or how hard they train. Sneering down with their seemingly infinite power are the demons. Haunted by the thought that they couldn‚Äôt do anything, that they had to be protected by others, the young humans have faced frustration, sadness, and uncontrollable tears. For the sake of their slain family members and beloved people they still had to protect, they‚Äôve trained over and over, fought to survive the Final Selection, narrowly escaped death every night, and made huge progress. Yet their power was still nowhere near enough. And now, the man they had followed has fallen victim to their enemies. No matter how many times you watch the movie, this realization will tear your heart to shreds. In the face of such a tragedy, Inosuke offers some words that are deeply touching. His upbringing among wild boars may have given him less experience with other people, but we can see that he‚Äôs grown yet again as a human.  9. Rengoku‚Äôs Explosive Battle Through LifeFans who have already read the manga will know what I‚Äôm talking about. In any case, I won‚Äôt elaborate too much, but I urge you to burn his battles and his way of life into your mind ‚Äì why he risks his life in battle, why he tries to protect humans. His crystal-clear beliefs and promises will also give you an insight into the loneliness he must bear. Protect the weak. Respect one‚Äôs duty and values. In what light will you see these warriors and hear their words as they fight to protect others? If you have the chance, please find out on the big screen. Finally, let me leave you with these words: ‚ÄúKeep your heart burning!‚Äù (And don‚Äôt forget a handkerchief!)This is a Tokyo Otaku Mode original article with text and illustrations by HER.--Need some more quality time with the KnY crew?

Get ready to engage in some Total Concentration Reading!First, let‚Äôs talk about the background behind  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train. The original manga,  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba, tells the story of Tanjiro Kamado, a boy who embarks on a quest to heal his sister Nezuko, who has been transformed into a demon. During this journey, he and his companions must face intense battles against evil demons.  Mugen Train covers the 7th and 8th volumes of the manga. In terms of the TV anime series, the movie follows on from the story of the 26th and last episode, ‚ÄúNew Mission.‚Äù If you haven‚Äôt seen the TV anime yet, I recommend watching it first.

The flames that roar through the train, his unbelievably swift reactions, the movement of his cape, his intense red eyes that seem to see through all‚Ä¶Everything. Is. Way. Too. Cool.Seriously, everything about him is just so cool‚Ä¶ How am I meant to deal with this‚Ä¶ (I mean, I don‚Äôt have to.) The moment he began his Flame Breathing First Form: Shiranui, I realized, ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôve pretty much spent nothing on this movie‚Ä¶ This is already worth the ticket‚Ä¶‚ÄùFrom his sword techniques to his mere presence and words, every part of Rengoku Kyojuro is priceless. Honestly, this movie leaves you no time to even blink. Everything is something to look out for. I don‚Äôt want you to let even a tenth of a second escape your attention, so be sure to use plenty of eye drops before it starts 3. The Mugen Train and its Real-Life OriginsLet‚Äôs take a look at a certain train otaku favorite in Japan, SL Hitoyoshi, which features an 8620 Class steam locomotive. Commonly known as ‚Äúhachiroku"" (meaning ""86‚Äù), it‚Äôs none other than the locomotive that inspired the appearance of the Mugen Train! From the beginning of the movie, we get plenty of glimpses at Japan in the Taisho Era (1912-1926), from the design of the station and passenger cars to the fashion of the passengers themselves. Through the animation, we also experience its sheer speed, as well as the actual sensation of being swayed as we ride in the heavy carriages. It‚Äôs downright awesome!Here in Japan, we actually got to see a collaboration between SL Hitoyoshi and  KnY, where the locomotive was transformed into a real-life Mugen Train for a limited run. Naturally, it was so popular that it was practically impossible to get your hands on tickets. (Yup, I didn‚Äôt manage to snag any either‚Ä¶) It quickly became a viral topic on social media, with people excited to see a ‚Äúreal-life Mugen Train‚Äù even in photos and videos.  4. Tanjiro‚Äôs Feelings For His FamilyKnY‚Äôs story begins with a powerful theme: family. We also see its importance in the movie, which beautifully illustrates Tanjiro‚Äôs feelings for his family. He‚Äôs already lost so many people important to him, but no matter how much he wants to return to those happy days, there‚Äôs no going back ‚Äì he'll never be able to see his loved ones again. This movie‚Äôs depiction of Tanjiro‚Äôs family, entangled in memories both happy and sad, but never to be restored, will have your eyes streaming with tears. 5. And Of Course, the Funny Scenes!Another great element that we get to see again are the hilarious moments between Inosuke and Zenitsu! You‚Äôll also find yourself chuckling at Rengoku as he scarfs down his ekiben (bento lunches bought at train stations). Another heads up ‚Äì at first Zenitsu‚Äôs dream sequence will probably just seem funny, but if you pay attention to where it‚Äôs set, that smile might turn into tears‚Ä¶ (This is especially aimed at anyone who‚Äôs already read the manga up to the Mugen Train arc ‚Äì I want you to think long and hard about where he is in that dream!) Spoiler Alert!From here, I‚Äôll be introducing specific details about the movie, so please stop reading if you want to avoid spoilers.‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚ÜìAlright! Let‚Äôs keep going with more highlights, including actual scenes from the movie! 6. An Unprecedented Battle of IntellectTanjiro‚Äôs new foe, and the demon controlling the Mugen Train is Enmu, Lower Rank One in the Twelve Kizuki. Before the events of the movie, Muzan himself took a liking to Enmu and gifted him with Muzan‚Äôs blood. Having gained power with this infusion, Enmu decides to enlist the help of humans ‚Äì or rather, use them as a means for his plan. Thus, the lives of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, Nezuko, and their mission companion, Rengoku, as well as the train‚Äôs many regular passengers, are Enmu‚Äôs next targets. His gentle and calm manner of speaking and friendly smile prove to make him an even more sinister character. Carrying out his plan with meticulous care, Enmu attempts to put Tanjiro and the other humans to sleep forever through his Blood Demon Art, a style of attack that they‚Äôve never faced before. How will Tanjiro and his fellow Demon Slayers wake themselves up from Enmu‚Äôs eternal dreams? 7. The Sudden Appearance of Upper Rank Three, AkazaThe last part of the movie takes a huge turn with the sudden appearance of Akaza (Upper Rank Three) and his fierce battle against Rengoku. Just before dawn, Tanjiro and the others finally get the chance to breathe a sigh of relief, having defeated Enmu and checked that the passengers are safe. But this only lasts for a moment, with the Demon Slayers gathered facing the dreaded Upper Rank Three for the first time. The sudden roaring sound signals the appearance of something... but then dies down, leaving an eerie silence. Then, a pair of eyes glisten in the darkness. This frightening sense of anticipation crosses the screen to weigh down on you, causing you to instinctively clench your fists in suspense‚Ä¶Despite Akaza being a favorite among  KnY‚Äôs many demons, we didn‚Äôt get any information on his voice actor, or even still images until the movie‚Äôs official release. As a result, fans speculated that the movie might only cover Enmu‚Äôs arc and stop before showing Akaza, or that the anime series would continue with his story. However, the movie‚Äôs premiere date came and the cat was finally let out of the bag. We now know that Akaza‚Äôs voice actor is Akira Ishida, famous for roles like Kaworu Nagisa in  Neon Genesis Evangelion! This casting was a huge yet welcome surprise for fans. If you‚Äôre watching the movie with Japanese audio, be sure to soak up every moment of Akaza‚Äôs malevolence, madness and despair through Ishida‚Äôs formidable voice acting!One more highlight is the overwhelming energy of Rengoku and Akaza in their battle scenes, yet another part where you can‚Äôt afford to blink. If IMAX screenings are available near you, take advantage of them and experience the fight‚Äôs sheer power at full volume. It goes without saying that you can still experience plenty at normal theaters, but I urge you to go and feel the huge impact behind each and every hit at IMAX volume levels! The depiction of the snowflake patterns in Akaza‚Äôs Technique Deployment ability is also a highlight. In the original manga‚Äôs 18th volume, we learn about Akaza‚Äôs past. Despite being a ruthless demon with numerous victims, the sorrows of his life as a human capture the pity of readers. Personally, he‚Äôs one of my favorite characters. After watching the movie, I also recommend going right to the rest of the manga to continue the story! 8. Tears of FrustrationAt the end of the battle, Tanjiro and his companions are overwhelmed by the realization that they are still too weak, no matter how much work they put in or how hard they train. Sneering down with their seemingly infinite power are the demons. Haunted by the thought that they couldn‚Äôt do anything, that they had to be protected by others, the young humans have faced frustration, sadness, and uncontrollable tears. For the sake of their slain family members and beloved people they still had to protect, they‚Äôve trained over and over, fought to survive the Final Selection, narrowly escaped death every night, and made huge progress. Yet their power was still nowhere near enough. And now, the man they had followed has fallen victim to their enemies. No matter how many times you watch the movie, this realization will tear your heart to shreds. In the face of such a tragedy, Inosuke offers some words that are deeply touching. His upbringing among wild boars may have given him less experience with other people, but we can see that he‚Äôs grown yet again as a human.  9. Rengoku‚Äôs Explosive Battle Through LifeFans who have already read the manga will know what I‚Äôm talking about. In any case, I won‚Äôt elaborate too much, but I urge you to burn his battles and his way of life into your mind ‚Äì why he risks his life in battle, why he tries to protect humans. His crystal-clear beliefs and promises will also give you an insight into the loneliness he must bear. Protect the weak. Respect one‚Äôs duty and values. In what light will you see these warriors and hear their words as they fight to protect others? If you have the chance, please find out on the big screen. Finally, let me leave you with these words: ‚ÄúKeep your heart burning!‚Äù (And don‚Äôt forget a handkerchief!)This is a Tokyo Otaku Mode original article with text and illustrations by HER.--Need some more quality time with the KnY crew?

MACROSS 7 BASARA EXPLOSION 2022 Official Concert Report‚ñ†MACROSS 7 BASARA EXPLOSION 2022 from FIRE BOMBER Supported by SANKYOConcert Report from the Zepp Yokohama Show MACROSS 7 BASARA EXPLOSION 2022 from FIRE BOMBER Supported by SANKYO. Four concerts across three venues, held as part of the 40th anniversary celebrations of the Macross franchise, culminating at Zepp DiverCity (Tokyo) on Friday, January 28. To whet your appetite for the upcoming finale, which will be livestreamed around the globe, let us give you a glimpse of the Zepp Yokohama opening act. As the opening video came to a close, the roar of Basara‚Äôs guitar reverberated throughout the venue. ‚ÄúFire!‚Äù Basara Nekki‚Äôs voice rang out, setting off this year‚Äôs EXPLOSION with his famous ‚ÄúListen to my song!‚Äù Behind Yoshiki Fukuyama, Basara‚Äôs singing voice and guitarist, stood F-BAND, comprised of Shoichiro Aso on drums, Tetsuro on bass and PONCHAN on keyboard. And in answer to that passionate voice and the vibrant rock sounds behind it rose the thunderous applause and raised fists of the audience. Introducing himself as Basara‚Äôs singing voice, Fukuyama declared that he would take everyone‚Äôs feelings on board and carry them across the galaxy with his song, launching into FIRE BOMBER‚Äôs rock numbers one after another. It was far from easy to stay silent in the face of the fervor on display. But Fukuyama threw himself into shouting and singing on behalf of the audience as well. The most amazing thing of all was that he did this while also playing the guitar riffs, solos and backing tracks all on his own. And since there are numerous ad-libs in the guitar solos, each and every song Fukuyama performed became a unique piece that can only be heard on this tour. From songs where the guitar ran wild to ones where it cried‚Äîthe breadth of expression he achieved was nigh-unbelievable. The importance of the drums and bass, as well as the keyboard layered on top, cannot be understated either, but above all, this concert really drove home the power of Basara, of Yoshiki Fukuyama.Also memorable were elements of the performance that drew the audience into the world of Macross 7, including lines spoken by Basara himself (voiced by Nobutoshi Canna), and the playing of songs to background footage from the series. One highlight of the night was SPIRAL ANSWER, a rare song that was seldom used in the anime series. As the sensual music and Fukuyama‚Äôs soulful voice resounded through the venue, I was hit with the sheer intensity of experiencing it live.

They capped it off with a proper duet, before we plunged headlong into the second half of the concert.During the second half of the concert, Fukuyama continued to direct his burning passion towards the entire universe. Next up was ‚Äúthe very first song I wrote for Macross 7‚Äù‚ÄîMY SOUL FOR YOU. This is a song that builds from a quiet start, with note after note slowly being added, and Fukuyama‚Äôs vocals matched that growing fire. I will never forget the sight of him in that moment, singing his soul out, on stage, right before our very eyes.Another special moment came with a song accompanied by just the keyboard: although the audience was unable to join in, it felt like we could hear the chorus singing along. With the audience pumping their fists to many a song, it was clear that the stage and the floor were as one both in heart and soul. As the concert drew to a close, Fukuyama reflected on what he had learned anew, that ‚ÄúThinking about each and every lyric as I sang has reminded me once again just how positive and optimistic Basara is.

MACROSS 7 BASARA EXPLOSION 2022 Official Concert Report‚ñ†MACROSS 7 BASARA EXPLOSION 2022 from FIRE BOMBER Supported by SANKYOConcert Report from the Zepp Yokohama Show MACROSS 7 BASARA EXPLOSION 2022 from FIRE BOMBER Supported by SANKYO. Four concerts across three venues, held as part of the 40th anniversary celebrations of the Macross franchise, culminating at Zepp DiverCity (Tokyo) on Friday, January 28. To whet your appetite for the upcoming finale, which will be livestreamed around the globe, let us give you a glimpse of the Zepp Yokohama opening act. As the opening video came to a close, the roar of Basara‚Äôs guitar reverberated throughout the venue. ‚ÄúFire!‚Äù Basara Nekki‚Äôs voice rang out, setting off this year‚Äôs EXPLOSION with his famous ‚ÄúListen to my song!‚Äù Behind Yoshiki Fukuyama, Basara‚Äôs singing voice and guitarist, stood F-BAND, comprised of Shoichiro Aso on drums, Tetsuro on bass and PONCHAN on keyboard. And in answer to that passionate voice and the vibrant rock sounds behind it rose the thunderous applause and raised fists of the audience. Introducing himself as Basara‚Äôs singing voice, Fukuyama declared that he would take everyone‚Äôs feelings on board and carry them across the galaxy with his song, launching into FIRE BOMBER‚Äôs rock numbers one after another. It was far from easy to stay silent in the face of the fervor on display. But Fukuyama threw himself into shouting and singing on behalf of the audience as well. The most amazing thing of all was that he did this while also playing the guitar riffs, solos and backing tracks all on his own. And since there are numerous ad-libs in the guitar solos, each and every song Fukuyama performed became a unique piece that can only be heard on this tour. From songs where the guitar ran wild to ones where it cried‚Äîthe breadth of expression he achieved was nigh-unbelievable. The importance of the drums and bass, as well as the keyboard layered on top, cannot be understated either, but above all, this concert really drove home the power of Basara, of Yoshiki Fukuyama.Also memorable were elements of the performance that drew the audience into the world of Macross 7, including lines spoken by Basara himself (voiced by Nobutoshi Canna), and the playing of songs to background footage from the series. One highlight of the night was SPIRAL ANSWER, a rare song that was seldom used in the anime series. As the sensual music and Fukuyama‚Äôs soulful voice resounded through the venue, I was hit with the sheer intensity of experiencing it live. I was also reminded of what a hidden gem of a song it was.It was also quite special to experience the pairing of Fukuyama‚Äôs live performance of the Macross 7 opening theme, SEVENTH MOON, with a video of Basara performing that same song, compiled from Uta Macross (a mobile game only available in Japan).

MACROSS 7 BASARA EXPLOSION 2022 Official Concert Report‚ñ†MACROSS 7 BASARA EXPLOSION 2022 from FIRE BOMBER Supported by SANKYOConcert Report from the Zepp Yokohama Show MACROSS 7 BASARA EXPLOSION 2022 from FIRE BOMBER Supported by SANKYO. Four concerts across three venues, held as part of the 40th anniversary celebrations of the Macross franchise, culminating at Zepp DiverCity (Tokyo) on Friday, January 28. To whet your appetite for the upcoming finale, which will be livestreamed around the globe, let us give you a glimpse of the Zepp Yokohama opening act. As the opening video came to a close, the roar of Basara‚Äôs guitar reverberated throughout the venue. ‚ÄúFire!‚Äù Basara Nekki‚Äôs voice rang out, setting off this year‚Äôs EXPLOSION with his famous ‚ÄúListen to my song!‚Äù Behind Yoshiki Fukuyama, Basara‚Äôs singing voice and guitarist, stood F-BAND, comprised of Shoichiro Aso on drums, Tetsuro on bass and PONCHAN on keyboard. And in answer to that passionate voice and the vibrant rock sounds behind it rose the thunderous applause and raised fists of the audience. Introducing himself as Basara‚Äôs singing voice, Fukuyama declared that he would take everyone‚Äôs feelings on board and carry them across the galaxy with his song, launching into FIRE BOMBER‚Äôs rock numbers one after another. It was far from easy to stay silent in the face of the fervor on display. But Fukuyama threw himself into shouting and singing on behalf of the audience as well. The most amazing thing of all was that he did this while also playing the guitar riffs, solos and backing tracks all on his own. And since there are numerous ad-libs in the guitar solos, each and every song Fukuyama performed became a unique piece that can only be heard on this tour. From songs where the guitar ran wild to ones where it cried‚Äîthe breadth of expression he achieved was nigh-unbelievable. The importance of the drums and bass, as well as the keyboard layered on top, cannot be understated either, but above all, this concert really drove home the power of Basara, of Yoshiki Fukuyama.Also memorable were elements of the performance that drew the audience into the world of Macross 7, including lines spoken by Basara himself (voiced by Nobutoshi Canna), and the playing of songs to background footage from the series. One highlight of the night was SPIRAL ANSWER, a rare song that was seldom used in the anime series. As the sensual music and Fukuyama‚Äôs soulful voice resounded through the venue, I was hit with the sheer intensity of experiencing it live. I was also reminded of what a hidden gem of a song it was.It was also quite special to experience the pairing of Fukuyama‚Äôs live performance of the Macross 7 opening theme, SEVENTH MOON, with a video of Basara performing that same song, compiled from Uta Macross (a mobile game only available in Japan). Normally, you‚Äôd expect the live performer to play in sync with the accompanying video. In this case, however, Fukuyama noted that ‚ÄúSince we aren‚Äôt exactly performing to a metronome here, we‚Äôre having the video match our playing instead.‚Äù This tongue-in-cheek comment showed just how much value he places on the spontaneity of live gigs. Naturally, the performances weren‚Äôt an exact match. But still, seeing the passion of the animated Basara‚Äîclad in a whole range of costumes‚Äîwhile listening to SEVENTH MOON performed live was quite a thing to behold. Next was time for an ‚ÄúAcoustic Corner,‚Äù a more laid-back, chill period in the middle of the set. After treating us to a solo, acoustic rendition of a popular Walk√ºre song from MacrossŒî‚Äîthe laid-back feeling he captured was reminiscent of Showa-era pop‚ÄîFukuyama invited special guest, Nobutoshi Canna, to join him on stage. The duo shared a fun memory from the production of Macross 7, of a scene where Canna had been asked to ad-lib a song to Fukuyama‚Äôs guitar, leading to a cheery new rendition of that same song, remixed for this very occasion. They capped it off with a proper duet, before we plunged headlong into the second half of the concert.During the second half of the concert, Fukuyama continued to direct his burning passion towards the entire universe. Next up was ‚Äúthe very first song I wrote for Macross 7‚Äù‚ÄîMY SOUL FOR YOU. This is a song that builds from a quiet start, with note after note slowly being added, and Fukuyama‚Äôs vocals matched that growing fire. I will never forget the sight of him in that moment, singing his soul out, on stage, right before our very eyes.Another special moment came with a song accompanied by just the keyboard: although the audience was unable to join in, it felt like we could hear the chorus singing along. With the audience pumping their fists to many a song, it was clear that the stage and the floor were as one both in heart and soul. As the concert drew to a close, Fukuyama reflected on what he had learned anew, that ‚ÄúThinking about each and every lyric as I sang has reminded me once again just how positive and optimistic Basara is. And I understand why you all continue to support him.‚Äù Then the final song reverberated through the venue, bringing the curtain down on this unforgettable Yokohama performance. One at which Basara had, once again, brought great courage and energy to each and every person in the audience.

09-04-2022,anime,11,0,https://otakumode.com/letter,Letter from the Founder | Tokyo Otaku Mode (TOM),"Tokyo Otaku ModeShopNewsGalleryOtapediaLog InSign UpAbout UsOur PromiseLetter From the FounderTokyo Otaku Mode FAQTOM Shop FAQTOM Premium FAQContact UsAdvertiseOur Business PartnersIcon and BannerAffiliate ProgramEnglishJapaneseLetter from the FounderMy name is Tomo Kamei, the Founder of Tokyo Otaku Mode. Since I am not sure which country those of you who are reading this may be in, let me greet you by saying good morning, good afternoon, and good evening.I created this page to provide you with a better understanding of what exactly Tokyo Otaku Mode is and also to convey the ambitions and intentions we as a team have for Tokyo Otaku Mode and how we plan to expand our service. I would like to directly convey to you in my own words when and why we started Tokyo Otaku Mode, the reason for expanding our service overseas, and our goal for the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The Bud that Sprouted Before the Creation of Tokyo Otaku ModeHave you ever seen a 40.1 meter tsunami?On March 10, 2011, I was working at an advertising company and on a business trip in Fukushima Prefecture. Tohoku is an area in the northern part of Japan. On that day, I had finished my work faster than I had thought I would. I boarded the bullet train, gazed out at the Tohoku scenery through the window, and took a small nap. The next day, I attended a business meeting at the office. Everything was normal.Then, the earthquake hit.Everything was flying off the shelves, and the shaking was so strong, it sounded like a scream. The ground was soft and flexible like a trampoline mat. I tried to keep calm, but it felt like the soles of my feet were on fire, and I was scared. After the shaking had stopped, we turned on the TV and the announcer was giving a warning: ‚ÄúA large 8.8 magnitude earthquake originating in Tohoku has struck. Everyone in the area should evacuate immediately.‚Äù Many people either lost their lives or went missing due to the earthquake and the resulting tsunami. Cities were swallowed by the waves of the tsunami that rose up high in the sky. One such city was the one I had been in the day before. The white shirts of the clients I met on the business trip, the smiles on the men‚Äôs faces who worked at the hotel, the red tiled roofs bleached by the sea breeze, the sound of the tires on the taxi I rode to the station squeaking to a stop. Even now, fragments of such memories from the city come to mind. And most of these were dragged away from reality by the earthquake and tsunami. My right index finger shook uncontrollably as I watched the TV.At that time, there was something else I was striving for other than work. That was starting up Tokyo Otaku Mode‚Äôs Facebook page. Basically, the idea was to transmit to the world representative otaku content like anime and manga. I ironed out the concept of Tokyo Otaku Mode with my colleagues, and, with the desire to somehow convey the current trends in Japanese content by utilizing our advantage of being in Japan, we thought up the idea that otaku content would be great as content delivered through Facebook to overseas countries. So, we came up with the plan to launch a Facebook page at the end of March, and we steadily started preparing. But then the earthquake happened and we thought about postponing the launch.In the days following, tragic news concerning the earthquake was reported on TV and in newspapers throughout Japan. I also saw despairing comments regarding Japan even in overseas news reports. Even online, blatantly inaccurate information like ‚ÄúSo-and-so manga artist died in the earthquake‚Äù was running rampant. What was really going on in Japan was not being properly conveyed.I talked with my colleagues once more. We wondered if there was something we could do, something we should do. We ultimately decided to launch the Facebook page we had been thinking about due to what was going on at the time. We wanted to be the first to convey to people all over the world the same enjoyment we had experienced from anime and manga up until then.Even today, I remember the sprouting of a powerful determination along with those feelings that matched our mission. Thus, two weeks after the earthquake, on March 24, I, along with my colleagues, launched Tokyo Otaku Mode‚Äôs Facebook page.Tokyo Otaku Mode: From Street Presentations to Silicon ValleyTokyo Otaku Mode was primarily started by several members, myself included. Even today, all of us are active in the company as founding members.At first, we started by introducing content related to the subcultures of Japan on Facebook. Looking back on it, it was a meager attempt, like something someone would make out of hobby. We went through a harsh time at the beginning where we weren‚Äôt getting any fans. Even still, we proceeded in trial and error and continued to persevere and update the page with information on Japan‚Äôs subcultures and pictures of cosplayers we would take by attending otaku-related events. By doing so, our number of fans slowly increased up to us having several million. Our continuing conviction of having this service be for the benefit of people all over the world had paid off.However, even though our number of fans continued to increase, I was still employed elsewhere, as were the other members. Even at the time when Tokyo Otaku Mode had several million fans, we were still treating it like a recreational activity, doing it between working and on our days off. At that time, I had a certain encounter that would change that. In the winter of 2012 (February), I had the chance to meet with Dave McClure, founder of 500 Startups, a small-investment fund that actively invests in businesses that are just starting out, which came about by us giving a street presentation in Shibuya. We desperately explained Tokyo Otaku Mode, and after listening to our presentation, Dave recommended us to come to Silicon Valley. In other words, he was going to invest in us.I immediately quit the company I was working for and made the jump to America. And just like that, my colleagues came along and on April 10, 2012, more than 10,000 kilometers from Tohoku in Silicon Valley, Tokyo Otaku Mode officially became a company. Three-hundred and ninety six days had passed since the day when I first saw on TV the devastation of the earthquake.Becoming a Service and Place for News to Satisfy Both Fans and CreatorsBefore Tokyo Otaku Mode became a corporate body (around 2010), thinking that I should understand overseas market economies, I used my own money to go to Shanghai, Vietnam, Philippines, and San Francisco to observe companies. In other words, I was able to see many things. As a part of these trips, I would do things like check to see what Japanese content and services were popular and listen to what the natives of the area had to say. Among all this, there was one thing that struck me, that being the circulation of pirated anime and manga. It differed by the areas in each country, but there was the same level of proliferation of pirated content, the source to which was unknown. People were buying these copies even though they knew they weren‚Äôt authentic‚Ä¶ In subtle ways, well-known anime and manga were being altered and sold. I had heard of the existence of pirated copies before, but I was astonished by the reality that works having been stripped of their original rights and values were being offered by people overseas.A pirated copy of a work is an illegal replication. There are pirated software and anime that ignore the rights of the works‚Äô creators that are sold and distributed online. Because most Japanese anime and manga is created in Japanese, translating them to other languages to circulate them overseas is unavoidable. Therefore, do translated pirated versions really convey the creator‚Äôs intent? Among manga that have 10 volumes, there may be a volume that becomes hard to find anywhere. Because fans in this instance won‚Äôt be able to keep up with the work‚Äôs story, they may feel disappointed and think ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt fun,‚Äù and this may be the basis for fans losing interest in anime and manga. By observing things overseas, it has strengthened my complicated feelings toward pirated copies. I think that those reading this have a love of Japanese anime and manga and a desire to enjoy what is to come. If that‚Äôs the case, I hope that you would show your understanding of the fact that by giving creators the value they rightfully deserve, you are helping them to continue creating.There are fans who want to happen upon new works and creators who want to create even better works. By viewing things overseas, the question ‚ÄúIf content could be supplied in a more legitimate way, would that make people happy?‚Äù came to mind. Tokyo Otaku Mode is our answer to that question. We are trying to create a worldwide platform that meets the needs of both fans and creators, a place that is unburdened by economic conditions and social issues of any single country or area, a place that anime and manga fans the world over can enjoy.Thus, through our service, we want to increase the earnings of anime with a production cost of $1 million to $2 or $3 million (By the way, there is a lot of deep otaku content in Japan. It is Tokyo Otaku Mode‚Äôs mission to also introduce this with everyone.). We want the works we introduce to be known throughout the world, and even for related products to steadily sell well; to timely offer information on products and works, regardless of country or area; and to return to a place where creators and manufacturers gain profits for their works. If we are able to do that, I believe that we can create a positive influence on all those related to producing works and that they will continue to create high-quality entertainment.The People of Tokyo Otaku ModeThe people who manage the Tokyo Otaku Mode service were brought together mainly through the founding members‚Äô personal connections.This includes not just the programmers who can be called the lifeline of managing the website, but also members who support the creators, members who manage the shop, cameramen, and editors. In other words, the site was established through assembling people from all kinds of fields in order to spread otaku content to people all over the world and to create an environment that creators can immerse themselves in.By the way, we use the catch-all term ‚Äúcreator‚Äù to refer to anyone who produces creative work and has the skills to make people enjoy it, whether they are illustrators, cosplayers, Vocaloid producers, manga artists, or something else. I want creators to thoroughly immerse themselves in creating their works. Occasionally, they slip into the world of a work that seems like it‚Äôs at the bottom of the ocean. They are so focused that they can‚Äôt hear anything around them, and they create worlds that no one has seen in form that everyone can see. Giving a work such form takes extraordinary ability and time.However, even though many young creators possess skill, they lack money. It‚Äôs difficult to eke out a living on just independent creations without cooperating with manufacturers and companies and establishing a sales route. To make ends meet, many must get second jobs. In other words, they have no choice but to scale back how much time they can devote to creating works. Even though they want to create work, reality won‚Äôt allow them to. Many creators have been burdened by this dilemma throughout history, even though they possess talent that would most likely bloom if only they had time to devote to it.That is why we lend our support to these creators. Basically, we do this by offering them a platform on which to show their works, help them to communicate with fans all over the world by translating their messages, and try to return the profits and rights to those who can‚Äôt spread their works to the world. We are doing a lot to collaborate with them, which also involves producing posters, T-shirts, and other original products of their works.Through their products, the creators can make a profit. Thus, they are able to devote more time to immersing themselves in their creations, which I believe heightens the possibility of them creating even better works. I want the wonderful works crafted by creators of such skill to be more highly known by everyone all over the world.Well, doesn‚Äôt that make you excited? What kind of new works will be created and what will the future hold? I want to happen upon a work and think ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad I found this work,‚Äù and then to spread this joy by sharing the work with everyone around the world.This is how all of us at Tokyo Otaku Mode feel.Tokyo Otaku Mode‚Äôs Mission: To Change the World‚Äôs Course By a Single MillimeterThe Earth‚Äôs diameter is 12,742 kilometers. Though the Himalayas and Africa‚Äôs Great Rift Valley are a different story. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode want to create a 1 millimeter shift in the world of someone born somewhere on this vast Earth. This may be something that many people also think. Art, services, religion, love‚Äì‚Äìit‚Äôs true that people and companies try to convey various thoughts to others. We understand that for those captivated by subcultures like anime and manga, enjoying such works and products brings about feelings of peace. It‚Äôs difficult for humans to feel depressed when they are enjoying something. It‚Äôs also difficult to feel sad or cry when you are happy and smiling. It is for that reason that the attitude of otaku who enjoy things from deep within their being may be the foundation for creating more peace throughout the world. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode believe in this possibility, and we want to steer the world in a better direction through elevating the level of familiarity and values of otaku culture.Our mission on a more concrete level is to deliver to the world Japanese otaku content. To say it a different way, we want to promote all otaku values and create a place and opportunities for each individual to be able to reflect upon the joy of being otaku. Another mission of ours is to discover and support talented creators in order to construct an ecosystem of creations being continuously realized. I may be speaking too grandiose, but we aim to create a new art culture that will in turn elevate the status of otaku culture.We merely propagate a variety of things to people around the world; the value of that is up to them. It is not our intention to arbitrarily push our own values. The world will be changed by the otaku that populate it; we are just laying the groundwork.Tokyo Otaku Mode ShopFinally, I‚Äôd like to talk about the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The thought of starting the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was born through our mission and our own personal experiences. An environment where people, things, and products that should be valued will surely be valued; a place to make both fans and creators happy. As an extension of these thoughts, the idea of establishing a shop service‚Äì‚Äìthrough which we could not only deliver to fans all over the world authentic products from Japan, but also deliver to fans‚Äô hands creators‚Äô works in the form of products on top of transmitting information and sharings creators‚Äô works‚Äì‚Äìbegan to blossom.Everything we sell on the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was procured through legitimate means. We received permission to sell each and every item, which we offer to everyone living overseas.This has always stayed constant, whether it‚Äôs an introduction to a creator‚Äôs work on the Gallery page, or distributing otaku news on the News page. What we do on the Shop page is the same as our overall mission: to deliver Japanese otaku content to everyone around the world. The Shop page is just a more tangible representation of this mission; it can be held, touched, and seen adorning nearby walls as canvas boards and posters. It‚Äôs a way to distinctly feel those merits. That is one of our desires for our shop service. We‚Äôd be happy if our shop is stocked with things that you enjoy.If there is something you can‚Äôt find, please send us an inquiry. We understand that for every 100 otaku, there will be 100 different things that they enjoy. Therefore, we‚Äôd like to hear requests from everyone around the world as to what kind of products they would like. I don‚Äôt know if we will be able to fulfill 100% of those requests, but we will do the best that we can.We want everyone around the world to look forward to receiving products they desire and relish the moment of finally getting those products and being so happy that their heart skips a beat. That is one of the highlights of being otaku. Artwork, check. News, check. Products, check. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode will continue day after day to offer fascinating otaku content for everyone in every area of the globe to enjoy. And we will proceed in changing the direction of the world.  Yes, even if it‚Äôs only a millimeter.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Since I am not sure which country those of you who are reading this may be in, let me greet you by saying good morning, good afternoon, and good evening.I created this page to provide you with a better understanding of what exactly Tokyo Otaku Mode is and also to convey the ambitions and intentions we as a team have for Tokyo Otaku Mode and how we plan to expand our service. I would like to directly convey to you in my own words when and why we started Tokyo Otaku Mode, the reason for expanding our service overseas, and our goal for the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The Bud that Sprouted Before the Creation of Tokyo Otaku ModeHave you ever seen a 40.1 meter tsunami?On March 10, 2011, I was working at an advertising company and on a business trip in Fukushima Prefecture. Tohoku is an area in the northern part of Japan. On that day, I had finished my work faster than I had thought I would. I boarded the bullet train, gazed out at the Tohoku scenery through the window, and took a small nap. The next day, I attended a business meeting at the office. Everything was normal.Then, the earthquake hit.Everything was flying off the shelves, and the shaking was so strong, it sounded like a scream. The ground was soft and flexible like a trampoline mat. I tried to keep calm, but it felt like the soles of my feet were on fire, and I was scared. After the shaking had stopped, we turned on the TV and the announcer was giving a warning: ‚ÄúA large 8.8 magnitude earthquake originating in Tohoku has struck. Everyone in the area should evacuate immediately.‚Äù Many people either lost their lives or went missing due to the earthquake and the resulting tsunami. Cities were swallowed by the waves of the tsunami that rose up high in the sky. One such city was the one I had been in the day before. The white shirts of the clients I met on the business trip, the smiles on the men‚Äôs faces who worked at the hotel, the red tiled roofs bleached by the sea breeze, the sound of the tires on the taxi I rode to the station squeaking to a stop. Even now, fragments of such memories from the city come to mind. And most of these were dragged away from reality by the earthquake and tsunami. My right index finger shook uncontrollably as I watched the TV.At that time, there was something else I was striving for other than work. That was starting up Tokyo Otaku Mode‚Äôs Facebook page. Basically, the idea was to transmit to the world representative otaku content like anime and manga. I ironed out the concept of Tokyo Otaku Mode with my colleagues, and, with the desire to somehow convey the current trends in Japanese content by utilizing our advantage of being in Japan, we thought up the idea that otaku content would be great as content delivered through Facebook to overseas countries. So, we came up with the plan to launch a Facebook page at the end of March, and we steadily started preparing. But then the earthquake happened and we thought about postponing the launch.In the days following, tragic news concerning the earthquake was reported on TV and in newspapers throughout Japan. I also saw despairing comments regarding Japan even in overseas news reports. Even online, blatantly inaccurate information like ‚ÄúSo-and-so manga artist died in the earthquake‚Äù was running rampant. What was really going on in Japan was not being properly conveyed.I talked with my colleagues once more. We wondered if there was something we could do, something we should do. We ultimately decided to launch the Facebook page we had been thinking about due to what was going on at the time. We wanted to be the first to convey to people all over the world the same enjoyment we had experienced from anime and manga up until then.Even today, I remember the sprouting of a powerful determination along with those feelings that matched our mission. Thus, two weeks after the earthquake, on March 24, I, along with my colleagues, launched Tokyo Otaku Mode‚Äôs Facebook page.Tokyo Otaku Mode: From Street Presentations to Silicon ValleyTokyo Otaku Mode was primarily started by several members, myself included. Even today, all of us are active in the company as founding members.At first, we started by introducing content related to the subcultures of Japan on Facebook. Looking back on it, it was a meager attempt, like something someone would make out of hobby. We went through a harsh time at the beginning where we weren‚Äôt getting any fans. Even still, we proceeded in trial and error and continued to persevere and update the page with information on Japan‚Äôs subcultures and pictures of cosplayers we would take by attending otaku-related events. By doing so, our number of fans slowly increased up to us having several million. Our continuing conviction of having this service be for the benefit of people all over the world had paid off.However, even though our number of fans continued to increase, I was still employed elsewhere, as were the other members. Even at the time when Tokyo Otaku Mode had several million fans, we were still treating it like a recreational activity, doing it between working and on our days off. At that time, I had a certain encounter that would change that. In the winter of 2012 (February), I had the chance to meet with Dave McClure, founder of 500 Startups, a small-investment fund that actively invests in businesses that are just starting out, which came about by us giving a street presentation in Shibuya. We desperately explained Tokyo Otaku Mode, and after listening to our presentation, Dave recommended us to come to Silicon Valley. In other words, he was going to invest in us.I immediately quit the company I was working for and made the jump to America. And just like that, my colleagues came along and on April 10, 2012, more than 10,000 kilometers from Tohoku in Silicon Valley, Tokyo Otaku Mode officially became a company. Three-hundred and ninety six days had passed since the day when I first saw on TV the devastation of the earthquake.Becoming a Service and Place for News to Satisfy Both Fans and CreatorsBefore Tokyo Otaku Mode became a corporate body (around 2010), thinking that I should understand overseas market economies, I used my own money to go to Shanghai, Vietnam, Philippines, and San Francisco to observe companies. In other words, I was able to see many things. As a part of these trips, I would do things like check to see what Japanese content and services were popular and listen to what the natives of the area had to say. Among all this, there was one thing that struck me, that being the circulation of pirated anime and manga. It differed by the areas in each country, but there was the same level of proliferation of pirated content, the source to which was unknown. People were buying these copies even though they knew they weren‚Äôt authentic‚Ä¶ In subtle ways, well-known anime and manga were being altered and sold. I had heard of the existence of pirated copies before, but I was astonished by the reality that works having been stripped of their original rights and values were being offered by people overseas.A pirated copy of a work is an illegal replication. There are pirated software and anime that ignore the rights of the works‚Äô creators that are sold and distributed online. Because most Japanese anime and manga is created in Japanese, translating them to other languages to circulate them overseas is unavoidable. Therefore, do translated pirated versions really convey the creator‚Äôs intent? Among manga that have 10 volumes, there may be a volume that becomes hard to find anywhere. Because fans in this instance won‚Äôt be able to keep up with the work‚Äôs story, they may feel disappointed and think ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt fun,‚Äù and this may be the basis for fans losing interest in anime and manga. By observing things overseas, it has strengthened my complicated feelings toward pirated copies. I think that those reading this have a love of Japanese anime and manga and a desire to enjoy what is to come. If that‚Äôs the case, I hope that you would show your understanding of the fact that by giving creators the value they rightfully deserve, you are helping them to continue creating.There are fans who want to happen upon new works and creators who want to create even better works. By viewing things overseas, the question ‚ÄúIf content could be supplied in a more legitimate way, would that make people happy?‚Äù came to mind. Tokyo Otaku Mode is our answer to that question. We are trying to create a worldwide platform that meets the needs of both fans and creators, a place that is unburdened by economic conditions and social issues of any single country or area, a place that anime and manga fans the world over can enjoy.Thus, through our service, we want to increase the earnings of anime with a production cost of $1 million to $2 or $3 million (By the way, there is a lot of deep otaku content in Japan. It is Tokyo Otaku Mode‚Äôs mission to also introduce this with everyone.). We want the works we introduce to be known throughout the world, and even for related products to steadily sell well; to timely offer information on products and works, regardless of country or area; and to return to a place where creators and manufacturers gain profits for their works.

I want creators to thoroughly immerse themselves in creating their works. Occasionally, they slip into the world of a work that seems like it‚Äôs at the bottom of the ocean. They are so focused that they can‚Äôt hear anything around them, and they create worlds that no one has seen in form that everyone can see. Giving a work such form takes extraordinary ability and time.However, even though many young creators possess skill, they lack money. It‚Äôs difficult to eke out a living on just independent creations without cooperating with manufacturers and companies and establishing a sales route. To make ends meet, many must get second jobs. In other words, they have no choice but to scale back how much time they can devote to creating works. Even though they want to create work, reality won‚Äôt allow them to. Many creators have been burdened by this dilemma throughout history, even though they possess talent that would most likely bloom if only they had time to devote to it.That is why we lend our support to these creators. Basically, we do this by offering them a platform on which to show their works, help them to communicate with fans all over the world by translating their messages, and try to return the profits and rights to those who can‚Äôt spread their works to the world. We are doing a lot to collaborate with them, which also involves producing posters, T-shirts, and other original products of their works.Through their products, the creators can make a profit. Thus, they are able to devote more time to immersing themselves in their creations, which I believe heightens the possibility of them creating even better works. I want the wonderful works crafted by creators of such skill to be more highly known by everyone all over the world.Well, doesn‚Äôt that make you excited? What kind of new works will be created and what will the future hold? I want to happen upon a work and think ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad I found this work,‚Äù and then to spread this joy by sharing the work with everyone around the world.This is how all of us at Tokyo Otaku Mode feel.Tokyo Otaku Mode‚Äôs Mission: To Change the World‚Äôs Course By a Single MillimeterThe Earth‚Äôs diameter is 12,742 kilometers. Though the Himalayas and Africa‚Äôs Great Rift Valley are a different story. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode want to create a 1 millimeter shift in the world of someone born somewhere on this vast Earth. This may be something that many people also think. Art, services, religion, love‚Äì‚Äìit‚Äôs true that people and companies try to convey various thoughts to others. We understand that for those captivated by subcultures like anime and manga, enjoying such works and products brings about feelings of peace. It‚Äôs difficult for humans to feel depressed when they are enjoying something. It‚Äôs also difficult to feel sad or cry when you are happy and smiling. It is for that reason that the attitude of otaku who enjoy things from deep within their being may be the foundation for creating more peace throughout the world. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode believe in this possibility, and we want to steer the world in a better direction through elevating the level of familiarity and values of otaku culture.Our mission on a more concrete level is to deliver to the world Japanese otaku content. To say it a different way, we want to promote all otaku values and create a place and opportunities for each individual to be able to reflect upon the joy of being otaku. Another mission of ours is to discover and support talented creators in order to construct an ecosystem of creations being continuously realized. I may be speaking too grandiose, but we aim to create a new art culture that will in turn elevate the status of otaku culture.We merely propagate a variety of things to people around the world; the value of that is up to them. It is not our intention to arbitrarily push our own values. The world will be changed by the otaku that populate it; we are just laying the groundwork.Tokyo Otaku Mode ShopFinally, I‚Äôd like to talk about the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The thought of starting the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was born through our mission and our own personal experiences. An environment where people, things, and products that should be valued will surely be valued; a place to make both fans and creators happy. As an extension of these thoughts, the idea of establishing a shop service‚Äì‚Äìthrough which we could not only deliver to fans all over the world authentic products from Japan, but also deliver to fans‚Äô hands creators‚Äô works in the form of products on top of transmitting information and sharings creators‚Äô works‚Äì‚Äìbegan to blossom.Everything we sell on the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was procured through legitimate means. We received permission to sell each and every item, which we offer to everyone living overseas.This has always stayed constant, whether it‚Äôs an introduction to a creator‚Äôs work on the Gallery page, or distributing otaku news on the News page. What we do on the Shop page is the same as our overall mission: to deliver Japanese otaku content to everyone around the world. The Shop page is just a more tangible representation of this mission; it can be held, touched, and seen adorning nearby walls as canvas boards and posters. It‚Äôs a way to distinctly feel those merits. That is one of our desires for our shop service. We‚Äôd be happy if our shop is stocked with things that you enjoy.If there is something you can‚Äôt find, please send us an inquiry. We understand that for every 100 otaku, there will be 100 different things that they enjoy. Therefore, we‚Äôd like to hear requests from everyone around the world as to what kind of products they would like. I don‚Äôt know if we will be able to fulfill 100% of those requests, but we will do the best that we can.We want everyone around the world to look forward to receiving products they desire and relish the moment of finally getting those products and being so happy that their heart skips a beat. That is one of the highlights of being otaku. Artwork, check. News, check. Products, check. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode will continue day after day to offer fascinating otaku content for everyone in every area of the globe to enjoy. And we will proceed in changing the direction of the world.  Yes, even if it‚Äôs only a millimeter.Thank you for taking the time to read this. Everyone here at Tokyo Otaku Mode would like to convey their thanks for embracing this place, cooperating with us, and helping us to grow up until now and into the future.",positive,,{}

Since I am not sure which country those of you who are reading this may be in, let me greet you by saying good morning, good afternoon, and good evening.I created this page to provide you with a better understanding of what exactly Tokyo Otaku Mode is and also to convey the ambitions and intentions we as a team have for Tokyo Otaku Mode and how we plan to expand our service. I would like to directly convey to you in my own words when and why we started Tokyo Otaku Mode, the reason for expanding our service overseas, and our goal for the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The Bud that Sprouted Before the Creation of Tokyo Otaku ModeHave you ever seen a 40.1 meter tsunami?On March 10, 2011, I was working at an advertising company and on a business trip in Fukushima Prefecture. Tohoku is an area in the northern part of Japan. On that day, I had finished my work faster than I had thought I would. I boarded the bullet train, gazed out at the Tohoku scenery through the window, and took a small nap. The next day, I attended a business meeting at the office. Everything was normal.Then, the earthquake hit.Everything was flying off the shelves, and the shaking was so strong, it sounded like a scream. The ground was soft and flexible like a trampoline mat. I tried to keep calm, but it felt like the soles of my feet were on fire, and I was scared. After the shaking had stopped, we turned on the TV and the announcer was giving a warning: ‚ÄúA large 8.8 magnitude earthquake originating in Tohoku has struck. Everyone in the area should evacuate immediately.‚Äù Many people either lost their lives or went missing due to the earthquake and the resulting tsunami. Cities were swallowed by the waves of the tsunami that rose up high in the sky. One such city was the one I had been in the day before. The white shirts of the clients I met on the business trip, the smiles on the men‚Äôs faces who worked at the hotel, the red tiled roofs bleached by the sea breeze, the sound of the tires on the taxi I rode to the station squeaking to a stop. Even now, fragments of such memories from the city come to mind. And most of these were dragged away from reality by the earthquake and tsunami. My right index finger shook uncontrollably as I watched the TV.At that time, there was something else I was striving for other than work. That was starting up Tokyo Otaku Mode‚Äôs Facebook page. Basically, the idea was to transmit to the world representative otaku content like anime and manga. I ironed out the concept of Tokyo Otaku Mode with my colleagues, and, with the desire to somehow convey the current trends in Japanese content by utilizing our advantage of being in Japan, we thought up the idea that otaku content would be great as content delivered through Facebook to overseas countries. So, we came up with the plan to launch a Facebook page at the end of March, and we steadily started preparing. But then the earthquake happened and we thought about postponing the launch.In the days following, tragic news concerning the earthquake was reported on TV and in newspapers throughout Japan. I also saw despairing comments regarding Japan even in overseas news reports. Even online, blatantly inaccurate information like ‚ÄúSo-and-so manga artist died in the earthquake‚Äù was running rampant. What was really going on in Japan was not being properly conveyed.I talked with my colleagues once more. We wondered if there was something we could do, something we should do. We ultimately decided to launch the Facebook page we had been thinking about due to what was going on at the time. We wanted to be the first to convey to people all over the world the same enjoyment we had experienced from anime and manga up until then.Even today, I remember the sprouting of a powerful determination along with those feelings that matched our mission. Thus, two weeks after the earthquake, on March 24, I, along with my colleagues, launched Tokyo Otaku Mode‚Äôs Facebook page.Tokyo Otaku Mode: From Street Presentations to Silicon ValleyTokyo Otaku Mode was primarily started by several members, myself included. Even today, all of us are active in the company as founding members.At first, we started by introducing content related to the subcultures of Japan on Facebook. Looking back on it, it was a meager attempt, like something someone would make out of hobby. We went through a harsh time at the beginning where we weren‚Äôt getting any fans. Even still, we proceeded in trial and error and continued to persevere and update the page with information on Japan‚Äôs subcultures and pictures of cosplayers we would take by attending otaku-related events. By doing so, our number of fans slowly increased up to us having several million. Our continuing conviction of having this service be for the benefit of people all over the world had paid off.However, even though our number of fans continued to increase, I was still employed elsewhere, as were the other members. Even at the time when Tokyo Otaku Mode had several million fans, we were still treating it like a recreational activity, doing it between working and on our days off. At that time, I had a certain encounter that would change that. In the winter of 2012 (February), I had the chance to meet with Dave McClure, founder of 500 Startups, a small-investment fund that actively invests in businesses that are just starting out, which came about by us giving a street presentation in Shibuya. We desperately explained Tokyo Otaku Mode, and after listening to our presentation, Dave recommended us to come to Silicon Valley. In other words, he was going to invest in us.I immediately quit the company I was working for and made the jump to America. And just like that, my colleagues came along and on April 10, 2012, more than 10,000 kilometers from Tohoku in Silicon Valley, Tokyo Otaku Mode officially became a company. Three-hundred and ninety six days had passed since the day when I first saw on TV the devastation of the earthquake.Becoming a Service and Place for News to Satisfy Both Fans and CreatorsBefore Tokyo Otaku Mode became a corporate body (around 2010), thinking that I should understand overseas market economies, I used my own money to go to Shanghai, Vietnam, Philippines, and San Francisco to observe companies. In other words, I was able to see many things. As a part of these trips, I would do things like check to see what Japanese content and services were popular and listen to what the natives of the area had to say. Among all this, there was one thing that struck me, that being the circulation of pirated anime and manga. It differed by the areas in each country, but there was the same level of proliferation of pirated content, the source to which was unknown. People were buying these copies even though they knew they weren‚Äôt authentic‚Ä¶ In subtle ways, well-known anime and manga were being altered and sold. I had heard of the existence of pirated copies before, but I was astonished by the reality that works having been stripped of their original rights and values were being offered by people overseas.A pirated copy of a work is an illegal replication. There are pirated software and anime that ignore the rights of the works‚Äô creators that are sold and distributed online. Because most Japanese anime and manga is created in Japanese, translating them to other languages to circulate them overseas is unavoidable. Therefore, do translated pirated versions really convey the creator‚Äôs intent? Among manga that have 10 volumes, there may be a volume that becomes hard to find anywhere. Because fans in this instance won‚Äôt be able to keep up with the work‚Äôs story, they may feel disappointed and think ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt fun,‚Äù and this may be the basis for fans losing interest in anime and manga. By observing things overseas, it has strengthened my complicated feelings toward pirated copies. I think that those reading this have a love of Japanese anime and manga and a desire to enjoy what is to come. If that‚Äôs the case, I hope that you would show your understanding of the fact that by giving creators the value they rightfully deserve, you are helping them to continue creating.There are fans who want to happen upon new works and creators who want to create even better works. By viewing things overseas, the question ‚ÄúIf content could be supplied in a more legitimate way, would that make people happy?‚Äù came to mind. Tokyo Otaku Mode is our answer to that question. We are trying to create a worldwide platform that meets the needs of both fans and creators, a place that is unburdened by economic conditions and social issues of any single country or area, a place that anime and manga fans the world over can enjoy.Thus, through our service, we want to increase the earnings of anime with a production cost of $1 million to $2 or $3 million (By the way, there is a lot of deep otaku content in Japan. It is Tokyo Otaku Mode‚Äôs mission to also introduce this with everyone.). We want the works we introduce to be known throughout the world, and even for related products to steadily sell well; to timely offer information on products and works, regardless of country or area; and to return to a place where creators and manufacturers gain profits for their works. If we are able to do that, I believe that we can create a positive influence on all those related to producing works and that they will continue to create high-quality entertainment.The People of Tokyo Otaku ModeThe people who manage the Tokyo Otaku Mode service were brought together mainly through the founding members‚Äô personal connections.This includes not just the programmers who can be called the lifeline of managing the website, but also members who support the creators, members who manage the shop, cameramen, and editors.

We are doing a lot to collaborate with them, which also involves producing posters, T-shirts, and other original products of their works.Through their products, the creators can make a profit. Thus, they are able to devote more time to immersing themselves in their creations, which I believe heightens the possibility of them creating even better works. I want the wonderful works crafted by creators of such skill to be more highly known by everyone all over the world.Well, doesn‚Äôt that make you excited? What kind of new works will be created and what will the future hold? I want to happen upon a work and think ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad I found this work,‚Äù and then to spread this joy by sharing the work with everyone around the world.This is how all of us at Tokyo Otaku Mode feel.Tokyo Otaku Mode‚Äôs Mission: To Change the World‚Äôs Course By a Single MillimeterThe Earth‚Äôs diameter is 12,742 kilometers. Though the Himalayas and Africa‚Äôs Great Rift Valley are a different story. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode want to create a 1 millimeter shift in the world of someone born somewhere on this vast Earth. This may be something that many people also think. Art, services, religion, love‚Äì‚Äìit‚Äôs true that people and companies try to convey various thoughts to others. We understand that for those captivated by subcultures like anime and manga, enjoying such works and products brings about feelings of peace. It‚Äôs difficult for humans to feel depressed when they are enjoying something. It‚Äôs also difficult to feel sad or cry when you are happy and smiling. It is for that reason that the attitude of otaku who enjoy things from deep within their being may be the foundation for creating more peace throughout the world. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode believe in this possibility, and we want to steer the world in a better direction through elevating the level of familiarity and values of otaku culture.Our mission on a more concrete level is to deliver to the world Japanese otaku content. To say it a different way, we want to promote all otaku values and create a place and opportunities for each individual to be able to reflect upon the joy of being otaku. Another mission of ours is to discover and support talented creators in order to construct an ecosystem of creations being continuously realized. I may be speaking too grandiose, but we aim to create a new art culture that will in turn elevate the status of otaku culture.We merely propagate a variety of things to people around the world; the value of that is up to them. It is not our intention to arbitrarily push our own values. The world will be changed by the otaku that populate it; we are just laying the groundwork.Tokyo Otaku Mode ShopFinally, I‚Äôd like to talk about the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The thought of starting the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was born through our mission and our own personal experiences. An environment where people, things, and products that should be valued will surely be valued; a place to make both fans and creators happy. As an extension of these thoughts, the idea of establishing a shop service‚Äì‚Äìthrough which we could not only deliver to fans all over the world authentic products from Japan, but also deliver to fans‚Äô hands creators‚Äô works in the form of products on top of transmitting information and sharings creators‚Äô works‚Äì‚Äìbegan to blossom.Everything we sell on the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was procured through legitimate means. We received permission to sell each and every item, which we offer to everyone living overseas.This has always stayed constant, whether it‚Äôs an introduction to a creator‚Äôs work on the Gallery page, or distributing otaku news on the News page. What we do on the Shop page is the same as our overall mission: to deliver Japanese otaku content to everyone around the world. The Shop page is just a more tangible representation of this mission; it can be held, touched, and seen adorning nearby walls as canvas boards and posters. It‚Äôs a way to distinctly feel those merits. That is one of our desires for our shop service. We‚Äôd be happy if our shop is stocked with things that you enjoy.If there is something you can‚Äôt find, please send us an inquiry. We understand that for every 100 otaku, there will be 100 different things that they enjoy. Therefore, we‚Äôd like to hear requests from everyone around the world as to what kind of products they would like. I don‚Äôt know if we will be able to fulfill 100% of those requests, but we will do the best that we can.We want everyone around the world to look forward to receiving products they desire and relish the moment of finally getting those products and being so happy that their heart skips a beat. That is one of the highlights of being otaku. Artwork, check. News, check. Products, check. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode will continue day after day to offer fascinating otaku content for everyone in every area of the globe to enjoy. And we will proceed in changing the direction of the world.  Yes, even if it‚Äôs only a millimeter.Thank you for taking the time to read this. Everyone here at Tokyo Otaku Mode would like to convey their thanks for embracing this place, cooperating with us, and helping us to grow up until now and into the future.",positive,,{}
09-04-2022,anime,11,0,https://otakumode.com/letter,Letter from the Founder | Tokyo Otaku Mode (TOM),"EnglishJapaneseLetter from the FounderMy name is Tomo Kamei, the Founder of Tokyo Otaku Mode. Since I am not sure which country those of you who are reading this may be in, let me greet you by saying good morning, good afternoon, and good evening.I created this page to provide you with a better understanding of what exactly Tokyo Otaku Mode is and also to convey the ambitions and intentions we as a team have for Tokyo Otaku Mode and how we plan to expand our service. I would like to directly convey to you in my own words when and why we started Tokyo Otaku Mode, the reason for expanding our service overseas, and our goal for the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The Bud that Sprouted Before the Creation of Tokyo Otaku ModeHave you ever seen a 40.1 meter tsunami?On March 10, 2011, I was working at an advertising company and on a business trip in Fukushima Prefecture. Tohoku is an area in the northern part of Japan. On that day, I had finished my work faster than I had thought I would. I boarded the bullet train, gazed out at the Tohoku scenery through the window, and took a small nap. The next day, I attended a business meeting at the office. Everything was normal.Then, the earthquake hit.Everything was flying off the shelves, and the shaking was so strong, it sounded like a scream. The ground was soft and flexible like a trampoline mat. I tried to keep calm, but it felt like the soles of my feet were on fire, and I was scared. After the shaking had stopped, we turned on the TV and the announcer was giving a warning: ‚ÄúA large 8.8 magnitude earthquake originating in Tohoku has struck. Everyone in the area should evacuate immediately.‚Äù Many people either lost their lives or went missing due to the earthquake and the resulting tsunami. Cities were swallowed by the waves of the tsunami that rose up high in the sky. One such city was the one I had been in the day before. The white shirts of the clients I met on the business trip, the smiles on the men‚Äôs faces who worked at the hotel, the red tiled roofs bleached by the sea breeze, the sound of the tires on the taxi I rode to the station squeaking to a stop. Even now, fragments of such memories from the city come to mind. And most of these were dragged away from reality by the earthquake and tsunami. My right index finger shook uncontrollably as I watched the TV.At that time, there was something else I was striving for other than work. That was starting up Tokyo Otaku Mode‚Äôs Facebook page. Basically, the idea was to transmit to the world representative otaku content like anime and manga. I ironed out the concept of Tokyo Otaku Mode with my colleagues, and, with the desire to somehow convey the current trends in Japanese content by utilizing our advantage of being in Japan, we thought up the idea that otaku content would be great as content delivered through Facebook to overseas countries. So, we came up with the plan to launch a Facebook page at the end of March, and we steadily started preparing. But then the earthquake happened and we thought about postponing the launch.In the days following, tragic news concerning the earthquake was reported on TV and in newspapers throughout Japan. I also saw despairing comments regarding Japan even in overseas news reports. Even online, blatantly inaccurate information like ‚ÄúSo-and-so manga artist died in the earthquake‚Äù was running rampant. What was really going on in Japan was not being properly conveyed.I talked with my colleagues once more. We wondered if there was something we could do, something we should do. We ultimately decided to launch the Facebook page we had been thinking about due to what was going on at the time. We wanted to be the first to convey to people all over the world the same enjoyment we had experienced from anime and manga up until then.Even today, I remember the sprouting of a powerful determination along with those feelings that matched our mission. Thus, two weeks after the earthquake, on March 24, I, along with my colleagues, launched Tokyo Otaku Mode‚Äôs Facebook page.Tokyo Otaku Mode: From Street Presentations to Silicon ValleyTokyo Otaku Mode was primarily started by several members, myself included. Even today, all of us are active in the company as founding members.At first, we started by introducing content related to the subcultures of Japan on Facebook. Looking back on it, it was a meager attempt, like something someone would make out of hobby. We went through a harsh time at the beginning where we weren‚Äôt getting any fans. Even still, we proceeded in trial and error and continued to persevere and update the page with information on Japan‚Äôs subcultures and pictures of cosplayers we would take by attending otaku-related events. By doing so, our number of fans slowly increased up to us having several million. Our continuing conviction of having this service be for the benefit of people all over the world had paid off.However, even though our number of fans continued to increase, I was still employed elsewhere, as were the other members. Even at the time when Tokyo Otaku Mode had several million fans, we were still treating it like a recreational activity, doing it between working and on our days off. At that time, I had a certain encounter that would change that. In the winter of 2012 (February), I had the chance to meet with Dave McClure, founder of 500 Startups, a small-investment fund that actively invests in businesses that are just starting out, which came about by us giving a street presentation in Shibuya. We desperately explained Tokyo Otaku Mode, and after listening to our presentation, Dave recommended us to come to Silicon Valley. In other words, he was going to invest in us.I immediately quit the company I was working for and made the jump to America. And just like that, my colleagues came along and on April 10, 2012, more than 10,000 kilometers from Tohoku in Silicon Valley, Tokyo Otaku Mode officially became a company. Three-hundred and ninety six days had passed since the day when I first saw on TV the devastation of the earthquake.Becoming a Service and Place for News to Satisfy Both Fans and CreatorsBefore Tokyo Otaku Mode became a corporate body (around 2010), thinking that I should understand overseas market economies, I used my own money to go to Shanghai, Vietnam, Philippines, and San Francisco to observe companies. In other words, I was able to see many things. As a part of these trips, I would do things like check to see what Japanese content and services were popular and listen to what the natives of the area had to say. Among all this, there was one thing that struck me, that being the circulation of pirated anime and manga. It differed by the areas in each country, but there was the same level of proliferation of pirated content, the source to which was unknown. People were buying these copies even though they knew they weren‚Äôt authentic‚Ä¶ In subtle ways, well-known anime and manga were being altered and sold. I had heard of the existence of pirated copies before, but I was astonished by the reality that works having been stripped of their original rights and values were being offered by people overseas.A pirated copy of a work is an illegal replication. There are pirated software and anime that ignore the rights of the works‚Äô creators that are sold and distributed online. Because most Japanese anime and manga is created in Japanese, translating them to other languages to circulate them overseas is unavoidable. Therefore, do translated pirated versions really convey the creator‚Äôs intent? Among manga that have 10 volumes, there may be a volume that becomes hard to find anywhere. Because fans in this instance won‚Äôt be able to keep up with the work‚Äôs story, they may feel disappointed and think ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt fun,‚Äù and this may be the basis for fans losing interest in anime and manga. By observing things overseas, it has strengthened my complicated feelings toward pirated copies. I think that those reading this have a love of Japanese anime and manga and a desire to enjoy what is to come. If that‚Äôs the case, I hope that you would show your understanding of the fact that by giving creators the value they rightfully deserve, you are helping them to continue creating.There are fans who want to happen upon new works and creators who want to create even better works. By viewing things overseas, the question ‚ÄúIf content could be supplied in a more legitimate way, would that make people happy?‚Äù came to mind. Tokyo Otaku Mode is our answer to that question. We are trying to create a worldwide platform that meets the needs of both fans and creators, a place that is unburdened by economic conditions and social issues of any single country or area, a place that anime and manga fans the world over can enjoy.Thus, through our service, we want to increase the earnings of anime with a production cost of $1 million to $2 or $3 million (By the way, there is a lot of deep otaku content in Japan. It is Tokyo Otaku Mode‚Äôs mission to also introduce this with everyone.). We want the works we introduce to be known throughout the world, and even for related products to steadily sell well; to timely offer information on products and works, regardless of country or area; and to return to a place where creators and manufacturers gain profits for their works. If we are able to do that, I believe that we can create a positive influence on all those related to producing works and that they will continue to create high-quality entertainment.The People of Tokyo Otaku ModeThe people who manage the Tokyo Otaku Mode service were brought together mainly through the founding members‚Äô personal connections.This includes not just the programmers who can be called the lifeline of managing the website, but also members who support the creators, members who manage the shop, cameramen, and editors. In other words, the site was established through assembling people from all kinds of fields in order to spread otaku content to people all over the world and to create an environment that creators can immerse themselves in.By the way, we use the catch-all term ‚Äúcreator‚Äù to refer to anyone who produces creative work and has the skills to make people enjoy it, whether they are illustrators, cosplayers, Vocaloid producers, manga artists, or something else. I want creators to thoroughly immerse themselves in creating their works. Occasionally, they slip into the world of a work that seems like it‚Äôs at the bottom of the ocean. They are so focused that they can‚Äôt hear anything around them, and they create worlds that no one has seen in form that everyone can see. Giving a work such form takes extraordinary ability and time.However, even though many young creators possess skill, they lack money. It‚Äôs difficult to eke out a living on just independent creations without cooperating with manufacturers and companies and establishing a sales route. To make ends meet, many must get second jobs. In other words, they have no choice but to scale back how much time they can devote to creating works. Even though they want to create work, reality won‚Äôt allow them to. Many creators have been burdened by this dilemma throughout history, even though they possess talent that would most likely bloom if only they had time to devote to it.That is why we lend our support to these creators. Basically, we do this by offering them a platform on which to show their works, help them to communicate with fans all over the world by translating their messages, and try to return the profits and rights to those who can‚Äôt spread their works to the world.

We at Tokyo Otaku Mode believe in this possibility, and we want to steer the world in a better direction through elevating the level of familiarity and values of otaku culture.Our mission on a more concrete level is to deliver to the world Japanese otaku content. To say it a different way, we want to promote all otaku values and create a place and opportunities for each individual to be able to reflect upon the joy of being otaku. Another mission of ours is to discover and support talented creators in order to construct an ecosystem of creations being continuously realized. I may be speaking too grandiose, but we aim to create a new art culture that will in turn elevate the status of otaku culture.We merely propagate a variety of things to people around the world; the value of that is up to them. It is not our intention to arbitrarily push our own values. The world will be changed by the otaku that populate it; we are just laying the groundwork.Tokyo Otaku Mode ShopFinally, I‚Äôd like to talk about the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The thought of starting the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was born through our mission and our own personal experiences. An environment where people, things, and products that should be valued will surely be valued; a place to make both fans and creators happy. As an extension of these thoughts, the idea of establishing a shop service‚Äì‚Äìthrough which we could not only deliver to fans all over the world authentic products from Japan, but also deliver to fans‚Äô hands creators‚Äô works in the form of products on top of transmitting information and sharings creators‚Äô works‚Äì‚Äìbegan to blossom.Everything we sell on the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was procured through legitimate means. We received permission to sell each and every item, which we offer to everyone living overseas.This has always stayed constant, whether it‚Äôs an introduction to a creator‚Äôs work on the Gallery page, or distributing otaku news on the News page. What we do on the Shop page is the same as our overall mission: to deliver Japanese otaku content to everyone around the world. The Shop page is just a more tangible representation of this mission; it can be held, touched, and seen adorning nearby walls as canvas boards and posters. It‚Äôs a way to distinctly feel those merits. That is one of our desires for our shop service. We‚Äôd be happy if our shop is stocked with things that you enjoy.If there is something you can‚Äôt find, please send us an inquiry. We understand that for every 100 otaku, there will be 100 different things that they enjoy. Therefore, we‚Äôd like to hear requests from everyone around the world as to what kind of products they would like. I don‚Äôt know if we will be able to fulfill 100% of those requests, but we will do the best that we can.We want everyone around the world to look forward to receiving products they desire and relish the moment of finally getting those products and being so happy that their heart skips a beat. That is one of the highlights of being otaku. Artwork, check. News, check. Products, check. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode will continue day after day to offer fascinating otaku content for everyone in every area of the globe to enjoy. And we will proceed in changing the direction of the world.  Yes, even if it‚Äôs only a millimeter.Thank you for taking the time to read this. Everyone here at Tokyo Otaku Mode would like to convey their thanks for embracing this place, cooperating with us, and helping us to grow up until now and into the future.",positive,,{}
