News Golden Kamuy Manga Ends in 3 Chapters   posted on 2022-04-06 23:04 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Manga ends with 314th chapter on April 28    This year's 19th issue of Shueisha's Young Jump magazine announced on Thursday that Satoru Noda's Golden Kamuy manga will end in three chapters. The 312th will debut on April 14, the 313th chapter will premiere on April 21, and the 314th and final chapter will launch in the magazine's combined 22nd and 23rd issue on April 28.    Shueisha will publish the manga's 29th compiled book volume on April 19, the 30th volume on June 17, and the 31st and final volume on July 19.    The manga entered its final arc last July.    Noda launched the manga in Young Jump in 2014. Shueisha published the manga's 28th volume on December 17.    Viz Media is releasing the manga in English, and it describes the first volume:   In the early twentieth century, Russo-Japanese War veteran Saichi “Immortal” Sugimoto scratches out a meager existence during the postwar gold rush in the wilderness of Hokkaido. When he stumbles across a map to a fortune in hidden Ainu gold, he sets off on a treacherous quest to find it. But Sugimoto is not the only interested party, and everyone who knows about the gold will kill to possess it! Faced with the harsh conditions of the northern wilderness, ruthless criminals and rogue Japanese soldiers, Sugimoto will need all his skills and luck—and the help of an Ainu girl named Asirpa—to survive.  The manga inspired an anime, and the first television anime season premiered in April 2018. Crunchyroll streamed the series with English subtitles as it aired in Japan, and Funimation streamed it with an English dub. The second season premiered in October 2018. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired, and Funimation began streaming an English dub later that month. The third season premiered in October 2020. Crunchyroll streamed the anime as it aired in Japan. Funimation streamed an English dub.    The fourth season will premiere in October.    The manga's 15th compiled book volume shipped in September 2018, and it bundled an anime DVD focusing on the manga's Barato arc. The manga's 17th volume shipped in March 2019, and it also bundled an anime DVD. A third original anime video (OVA) for the Monster arc shipped with the manga's 19th volume in September 2019. The 23rd volume shipped in September with a fourth OVA episode that adapts the manga's ""forbidden"" ""Shiton Animal Chronicles"" story.

News Golden Kamuy Manga Ends in 3 Chapters   posted on 2022-04-06 23:04 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Manga ends with 314th chapter on April 28    This year's 19th issue of Shueisha's Young Jump magazine announced on Thursday that Satoru Noda's Golden Kamuy manga will end in three chapters. The 312th will debut on April 14, the 313th chapter will premiere on April 21, and the 314th and final chapter will launch in the magazine's combined 22nd and 23rd issue on April 28.    Shueisha will publish the manga's 29th compiled book volume on April 19, the 30th volume on June 17, and the 31st and final volume on July 19.    The manga entered its final arc last July.    Noda launched the manga in Young Jump in 2014. Shueisha published the manga's 28th volume on December 17.    Viz Media is releasing the manga in English, and it describes the first volume:   In the early twentieth century, Russo-Japanese War veteran Saichi “Immortal” Sugimoto scratches out a meager existence during the postwar gold rush in the wilderness of Hokkaido. When he stumbles across a map to a fortune in hidden Ainu gold, he sets off on a treacherous quest to find it. But Sugimoto is not the only interested party, and everyone who knows about the gold will kill to possess it! Faced with the harsh conditions of the northern wilderness, ruthless criminals and rogue Japanese soldiers, Sugimoto will need all his skills and luck—and the help of an Ainu girl named Asirpa—to survive.  The manga inspired an anime, and the first television anime season premiered in April 2018. Crunchyroll streamed the series with English subtitles as it aired in Japan, and Funimation streamed it with an English dub. The second season premiered in October 2018. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired, and Funimation began streaming an English dub later that month. The third season premiered in October 2020. Crunchyroll streamed the anime as it aired in Japan. Funimation streamed an English dub.    The fourth season will premiere in October.    The manga's 15th compiled book volume shipped in September 2018, and it bundled an anime DVD focusing on the manga's Barato arc. The manga's 17th volume shipped in March 2019, and it also bundled an anime DVD. A third original anime video (OVA) for the Monster arc shipped with the manga's 19th volume in September 2019. The 23rd volume shipped in September with a fourth OVA episode that adapts the manga's ""forbidden"" ""Shiton Animal Chronicles"" story.

News Golden Kamuy Manga Ends in 3 Chapters   posted on 2022-04-06 23:04 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Manga ends with 314th chapter on April 28    This year's 19th issue of Shueisha's Young Jump magazine announced on Thursday that Satoru Noda's Golden Kamuy manga will end in three chapters. The 312th will debut on April 14, the 313th chapter will premiere on April 21, and the 314th and final chapter will launch in the magazine's combined 22nd and 23rd issue on April 28.    Shueisha will publish the manga's 29th compiled book volume on April 19, the 30th volume on June 17, and the 31st and final volume on July 19.    The manga entered its final arc last July.    Noda launched the manga in Young Jump in 2014. Shueisha published the manga's 28th volume on December 17.    Viz Media is releasing the manga in English, and it describes the first volume:   In the early twentieth century, Russo-Japanese War veteran Saichi “Immortal” Sugimoto scratches out a meager existence during the postwar gold rush in the wilderness of Hokkaido. When he stumbles across a map to a fortune in hidden Ainu gold, he sets off on a treacherous quest to find it. But Sugimoto is not the only interested party, and everyone who knows about the gold will kill to possess it! Faced with the harsh conditions of the northern wilderness, ruthless criminals and rogue Japanese soldiers, Sugimoto will need all his skills and luck—and the help of an Ainu girl named Asirpa—to survive.  The manga inspired an anime, and the first television anime season premiered in April 2018. Crunchyroll streamed the series with English subtitles as it aired in Japan, and Funimation streamed it with an English dub. The second season premiered in October 2018. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired, and Funimation began streaming an English dub later that month. The third season premiered in October 2020. Crunchyroll streamed the anime as it aired in Japan. Funimation streamed an English dub.    The fourth season will premiere in October.    The manga's 15th compiled book volume shipped in September 2018, and it bundled an anime DVD focusing on the manga's Barato arc. The manga's 17th volume shipped in March 2019, and it also bundled an anime DVD. A third original anime video (OVA) for the Monster arc shipped with the manga's 19th volume in September 2019. The 23rd volume shipped in September with a fourth OVA episode that adapts the manga's ""forbidden"" ""Shiton Animal Chronicles"" story.

News Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans: Urðr-Hunt Spinoff Casts Rina Ikoma as Lead   posted on 2022-04-06 09:38 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Former AKB48, Nogizaka46 idol plays Wistario Afam in anime    Former AKB48 and Nogizaka46 member Rina Ikoma revealed on her Twitter account on Tuesday that she voices the main character Wistario Afam in Kidō Senshi Gundam: Tekketsu no Orphans: Urðr-Hunt (Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans: Urðr-Hunt), the spinoff from the Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans (Kidō Senshi Gundam: Tekketsu no Orphans) television anime series.    The new anime will debut within the corresponding Kidō Senshi Gundam: Tekketsu no Orphans G app in sping 2022, but the first part of the nine-part compilation special for the Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans anime included a portion of the anime when it debuted on Tuesday.    Sunrise and Bandai Namco Entertainment announced the Kidō Senshi Gundam: Tekketsu no Orphans: Urðr-Hunt spinoff in 2019. Kidō Senshi Gundam: Tekketsu no Orphans G is an app that is intended to combine anime and game elements, and bring together the original anime and Kidō Senshi Gundam: Tekketsu no Orphans: Urðr-Hunt.    Kidō Senshi Gundam: Tekketsu no Orphans: Urðr-Hunt's returning staff from the television anime includes director Tatsuyuki Nagai, original character designer Yu Ito, and character designer Michinori Chiba. Also returning are the mechanical designers (Naohiro Washio, Kanetake Ebikawa, Ippei Gyōbu, Kenji Teraoka, Tamotsu Shinohara), the art studio Kusanagi, and musical composer Masaru Yokoyama. However, Hajime Kamoshida, a script writer on the television anime, is credited as series script supervisor instead of Mari Okada.    The app will be free to download from Apple's App Store for iOS devices and the Google Play store for Android devices, although there will be in-app purchases.    The television anime's first season premiered in 2015, and the second season premiered in 2016. Daisuki, Gundam.info, and Hulu streamed the first season as it aired, and Crunchyroll streamed both seasons, and also streamed an English dub. Toonami began airing the first season with an English dub in June 2016, and debuted the second season in October 2017.    Writer Hajime Kamoshida and artists Dango and Hirosuke Terama's Mobile Suit Gundam: Tekketsu no Orphans Gekkō spinoff manga ended in Kadokawa's Gundam Ace magazine in March 2018.

News Kodansha USA Releases The Wallflower Manga Digitally on April 12   posted on 2022-04-06 23:00 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         All 36 volumes will be available    Kodansha Comics announced on Tuesday that it will release all 36 volumes of Tomoko Hayakawa's The Wallflower (Yamato Nadeshiko Shichihenge) manga available digitally on April 12. The manga will be available on BookWalker, Kindle, Apple Books, Google Play, Nook, Kobo, izneo, MyAnimeList, and other vendors.    Kodansha Comics describes the manga:    It's a gorgeous, spacious mansion, and four handsome, fifteen-year-old friends are allowed to live in it for free! There's only one condition—that within three years the guys must transform the owner's wallflower niece into a lady befitting the palace in which they all live! How hard can it be? Enter Sunako Nakahara, the agoraphobic, horror-movie-loving, pockmark-faced, frizzy-haired, fashion-illiterate recluse who tends to break into explosive nosebleeds whenever she sees anyone attractive. This project is going to take more than our four heroes ever expected: it needs a miracle!   Hayakawa launched the manga in Kodansha's Bessatsu Friend magazine in 2000, and  ended it in 2015 after 15 years of serialization.    Kodansha Comics began releasing The Wallflower in North America after taking over publication rights from Del Rey in 2010. Kodansha Comics released the manga's 36th and final compiled volume in March 2016. The Wallflower inspired a 2006-2007 25-episode television anime series, which ADV Films released on DVD. The story also inspired a live-action television series in 2010.

News Kodansha USA Releases The Wallflower Manga Digitally on April 12   posted on 2022-04-06 23:00 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         All 36 volumes will be available    Kodansha Comics announced on Tuesday that it will release all 36 volumes of Tomoko Hayakawa's The Wallflower (Yamato Nadeshiko Shichihenge) manga available digitally on April 12. The manga will be available on BookWalker, Kindle, Apple Books, Google Play, Nook, Kobo, izneo, MyAnimeList, and other vendors.    Kodansha Comics describes the manga:    It's a gorgeous, spacious mansion, and four handsome, fifteen-year-old friends are allowed to live in it for free! There's only one condition—that within three years the guys must transform the owner's wallflower niece into a lady befitting the palace in which they all live! How hard can it be? Enter Sunako Nakahara, the agoraphobic, horror-movie-loving, pockmark-faced, frizzy-haired, fashion-illiterate recluse who tends to break into explosive nosebleeds whenever she sees anyone attractive. This project is going to take more than our four heroes ever expected: it needs a miracle!   Hayakawa launched the manga in Kodansha's Bessatsu Friend magazine in 2000, and  ended it in 2015 after 15 years of serialization.    Kodansha Comics began releasing The Wallflower in North America after taking over publication rights from Del Rey in 2010. Kodansha Comics released the manga's 36th and final compiled volume in March 2016. The Wallflower inspired a 2006-2007 25-episode television anime series, which ADV Films released on DVD. The story also inspired a live-action television series in 2010.

Platinum End Episode 24  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 25th 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of Platinum End ?                     Community score: 1.8            Y'know, in hindsight, maybe electing a suicidal 12-year-old to become God was a bad idea.    I've been struggling with how to cover this finale for a bit, because there are two distinct parts to it, but absolutely nobody gives a single, solitary shit about one of them. So I could waste everyone's time by discussing the worthless excuse for denouement this finale offers for Mirai and Saki, but what is there really left to say about that fetid carcass of a romance? Do you really need me to harp on how heatless their relationship is? Or how the show is incapable of selling any of the happiness they claim to have found with each other? Like they even give Mirai a line saying he's happiest when he sees Saki smile, then never draw either of them smiling in the entire rest of the episode – not even at their wedding!    But that's not what any of you are here for, so let's not pretend. The only thing anybody who hadn't read the manga knew going into this anime, was that the series had an infamously batshit ending. I fully believe that reputation is the only reason anyone voted for this show to continue getting episode reviews. And while this adaptation has cut a lot of the most embarrassing scenes from the manga's back-half, there was no way it could get around this one. And I'm glad it didn't. With a more conventional, happily-ever-after ending, this show would have gone down as little more than a footnote; something brought up in passing like “Hey, did ya know the Death Note guys made a crummy ripoff of The Future Diary one time?” Yet with this ending, Platinum End at last becomes the train wreck it always promised it could be.    So let's get started.    First off, is anyone here a fan of Futurama? If so, you may remember that episode where Bender gets lost in the vacuum of space and becomes host to a super tiny race of aliens who start worshiping him as a God. Predictably he screws it up and they all end up killing each other, before he happens upon the real God in the depths of space, and gets a bit of sardonic wisdom for how to play the all-knowing ruler of a planet: “You have to use a light touch, like a safe cracker or pickpocket. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.” Platinum End's creators apparently watched that episode, took its jokey non-moral on the nature of godhood at face value, and decided to construct their story's whole universe around it.    Because that's the lesson Shuji learns upon becoming God and observing the entirety of human life and suffering. He gains access to the full gestalt of life on Earth; global inequality, hunger, greed, suffering, love, faith, and all experiences in-between. And the lesson he learns from the voice of God inside his head is that this is just how it's supposed to work – God is just there to hold down the corners of human existence and not break anything until he gets bored and decides to find a successor to man the security monitors. The lark's on the wing, the snail's on the thorn, God's got his thumb up his ass, and all's right in heaven. That is a bleak, nihilist view of metaphysics – that there is an all-knowing, all-powerful being that could change the world in any number of ways, and chooses not to for no particular reason. Which isn't necessarily a complaint! You could do a lot with that, especially after an entire season of everyone arguing about the purpose of God's existence. But this is Platinum End, which means there was never a chance in hell of that happening. Instead, we get the dumbest way to accidentally create a new theology ever conceived.    Shuji, despite being an edgelord teen who read and worshiped Super Atheist Yoneda and his mad cool Facts and Logic, never ran into that old canard about omnipotence. You know the one: “If God can do anything, can God make a rock so heavy even he can't lift it?” Instead, after mulling over the entire spectrum of human experience on a cosmic scale, he comes up with “If God is real, he should kill himself to prove it.” And without a second thought just goes for it. Giving us the amazing line you see up in the review image.    Yes, that's right, God commits suicide in order to see what will happen, and wouldn't you know it, turns out he was a load-bearing pillar of all Earthly life! D'oh! Thus every single living thing on the planet vanishes from existence. In their final moments, Saki and Mirai decide that they had a pretty good run and are happy to die at the whims of the teenager they forced to become God. Yoneda, meanwhile, decides he was right all along and that God and his angels were actually an extinction-level weapon created by human imagination to achieve Armageddon. I guess even in the face of imminent non-existence, dude just has to have the last word. Then, as we zoom out from the dead husk of Earth, in one final stupid twist, it turns out both humans and God were put there by some nameless race of immortal cosmic beings, seemingly as a failed simulation to find a way to kill themselves. It's like if somebody got really drunk and tried to explain the ending to Devilman, but it took six months to tell.    And that's how Platinum End calls it a career. I could sit here and attempt to pontificate over what any of this means, of how the creators came to this as the ending, but let's all be real here. This was never planned. The implications or morals or logistics of this entire ending were never thought through. What this finale was is a desperate Hail Mary pass to get somebody, anybody to remember this story for anything besides being an unremarkable failure. And to an extent it succeeded – I'm writing about it right now, after all. So I guess I have to hand it to them.    Ultimately, that's the legacy of this story. It came in with enough of a pedigree to at least have some expectations, immediately squandered them, and proceeded to flail frantically for any sense of identity or purpose. It never found them, and so all it could hope for was that its violent death throes could make it the type of bad story people will at least dunk on across the internet, and just barely managed it through sheer desperation. After 23 episodes of throwing every stupid, bad idea they could at the wall, they finally got a turd to stick at the 11th hour. Congratulations.

Platinum End Episode 24  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 25th 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of Platinum End ?                     Community score: 1.8            Y'know, in hindsight, maybe electing a suicidal 12-year-old to become God was a bad idea.    I've been struggling with how to cover this finale for a bit, because there are two distinct parts to it, but absolutely nobody gives a single, solitary shit about one of them. So I could waste everyone's time by discussing the worthless excuse for denouement this finale offers for Mirai and Saki, but what is there really left to say about that fetid carcass of a romance? Do you really need me to harp on how heatless their relationship is? Or how the show is incapable of selling any of the happiness they claim to have found with each other? Like they even give Mirai a line saying he's happiest when he sees Saki smile, then never draw either of them smiling in the entire rest of the episode – not even at their wedding!    But that's not what any of you are here for, so let's not pretend. The only thing anybody who hadn't read the manga knew going into this anime, was that the series had an infamously batshit ending. I fully believe that reputation is the only reason anyone voted for this show to continue getting episode reviews. And while this adaptation has cut a lot of the most embarrassing scenes from the manga's back-half, there was no way it could get around this one. And I'm glad it didn't. With a more conventional, happily-ever-after ending, this show would have gone down as little more than a footnote; something brought up in passing like “Hey, did ya know the Death Note guys made a crummy ripoff of The Future Diary one time?” Yet with this ending, Platinum End at last becomes the train wreck it always promised it could be.    So let's get started.    First off, is anyone here a fan of Futurama? If so, you may remember that episode where Bender gets lost in the vacuum of space and becomes host to a super tiny race of aliens who start worshiping him as a God. Predictably he screws it up and they all end up killing each other, before he happens upon the real God in the depths of space, and gets a bit of sardonic wisdom for how to play the all-knowing ruler of a planet: “You have to use a light touch, like a safe cracker or pickpocket. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.” Platinum End's creators apparently watched that episode, took its jokey non-moral on the nature of godhood at face value, and decided to construct their story's whole universe around it.    Because that's the lesson Shuji learns upon becoming God and observing the entirety of human life and suffering. He gains access to the full gestalt of life on Earth; global inequality, hunger, greed, suffering, love, faith, and all experiences in-between. And the lesson he learns from the voice of God inside his head is that this is just how it's supposed to work – God is just there to hold down the corners of human existence and not break anything until he gets bored and decides to find a successor to man the security monitors. The lark's on the wing, the snail's on the thorn, God's got his thumb up his ass, and all's right in heaven. That is a bleak, nihilist view of metaphysics – that there is an all-knowing, all-powerful being that could change the world in any number of ways, and chooses not to for no particular reason. Which isn't necessarily a complaint! You could do a lot with that, especially after an entire season of everyone arguing about the purpose of God's existence. But this is Platinum End, which means there was never a chance in hell of that happening. Instead, we get the dumbest way to accidentally create a new theology ever conceived.    Shuji, despite being an edgelord teen who read and worshiped Super Atheist Yoneda and his mad cool Facts and Logic, never ran into that old canard about omnipotence. You know the one: “If God can do anything, can God make a rock so heavy even he can't lift it?” Instead, after mulling over the entire spectrum of human experience on a cosmic scale, he comes up with “If God is real, he should kill himself to prove it.” And without a second thought just goes for it. Giving us the amazing line you see up in the review image.    Yes, that's right, God commits suicide in order to see what will happen, and wouldn't you know it, turns out he was a load-bearing pillar of all Earthly life! D'oh! Thus every single living thing on the planet vanishes from existence. In their final moments, Saki and Mirai decide that they had a pretty good run and are happy to die at the whims of the teenager they forced to become God. Yoneda, meanwhile, decides he was right all along and that God and his angels were actually an extinction-level weapon created by human imagination to achieve Armageddon. I guess even in the face of imminent non-existence, dude just has to have the last word. Then, as we zoom out from the dead husk of Earth, in one final stupid twist, it turns out both humans and God were put there by some nameless race of immortal cosmic beings, seemingly as a failed simulation to find a way to kill themselves. It's like if somebody got really drunk and tried to explain the ending to Devilman, but it took six months to tell.    And that's how Platinum End calls it a career. I could sit here and attempt to pontificate over what any of this means, of how the creators came to this as the ending, but let's all be real here. This was never planned. The implications or morals or logistics of this entire ending were never thought through. What this finale was is a desperate Hail Mary pass to get somebody, anybody to remember this story for anything besides being an unremarkable failure. And to an extent it succeeded – I'm writing about it right now, after all. So I guess I have to hand it to them.    Ultimately, that's the legacy of this story. It came in with enough of a pedigree to at least have some expectations, immediately squandered them, and proceeded to flail frantically for any sense of identity or purpose. It never found them, and so all it could hope for was that its violent death throes could make it the type of bad story people will at least dunk on across the internet, and just barely managed it through sheer desperation. After 23 episodes of throwing every stupid, bad idea they could at the wall, they finally got a turd to stick at the 11th hour. Congratulations.      Rating:     Platinum End is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.   <prevEpisodes 1-3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episode 6 Episode 7 Episodes 8-9 Episode 10 Episode 11 Episode 12 Episode 13 Episode 14 Episode 15 Episode 16 Episode 17 Episode 18 Episode 19 Episode 20 Episode 21 Episode 22 Episode 23 Episode 24     discuss this in the forum (107 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to Platinum End Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Platinum End Episode 24  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 25th 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of Platinum End ?                     Community score: 1.8            Y'know, in hindsight, maybe electing a suicidal 12-year-old to become God was a bad idea.    I've been struggling with how to cover this finale for a bit, because there are two distinct parts to it, but absolutely nobody gives a single, solitary shit about one of them. So I could waste everyone's time by discussing the worthless excuse for denouement this finale offers for Mirai and Saki, but what is there really left to say about that fetid carcass of a romance? Do you really need me to harp on how heatless their relationship is? Or how the show is incapable of selling any of the happiness they claim to have found with each other? Like they even give Mirai a line saying he's happiest when he sees Saki smile, then never draw either of them smiling in the entire rest of the episode – not even at their wedding!    But that's not what any of you are here for, so let's not pretend. The only thing anybody who hadn't read the manga knew going into this anime, was that the series had an infamously batshit ending. I fully believe that reputation is the only reason anyone voted for this show to continue getting episode reviews. And while this adaptation has cut a lot of the most embarrassing scenes from the manga's back-half, there was no way it could get around this one. And I'm glad it didn't. With a more conventional, happily-ever-after ending, this show would have gone down as little more than a footnote; something brought up in passing like “Hey, did ya know the Death Note guys made a crummy ripoff of The Future Diary one time?” Yet with this ending, Platinum End at last becomes the train wreck it always promised it could be.    So let's get started.    First off, is anyone here a fan of Futurama? If so, you may remember that episode where Bender gets lost in the vacuum of space and becomes host to a super tiny race of aliens who start worshiping him as a God. Predictably he screws it up and they all end up killing each other, before he happens upon the real God in the depths of space, and gets a bit of sardonic wisdom for how to play the all-knowing ruler of a planet: “You have to use a light touch, like a safe cracker or pickpocket. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.” Platinum End's creators apparently watched that episode, took its jokey non-moral on the nature of godhood at face value, and decided to construct their story's whole universe around it.    Because that's the lesson Shuji learns upon becoming God and observing the entirety of human life and suffering. He gains access to the full gestalt of life on Earth; global inequality, hunger, greed, suffering, love, faith, and all experiences in-between. And the lesson he learns from the voice of God inside his head is that this is just how it's supposed to work – God is just there to hold down the corners of human existence and not break anything until he gets bored and decides to find a successor to man the security monitors. The lark's on the wing, the snail's on the thorn, God's got his thumb up his ass, and all's right in heaven. That is a bleak, nihilist view of metaphysics – that there is an all-knowing, all-powerful being that could change the world in any number of ways, and chooses not to for no particular reason. Which isn't necessarily a complaint! You could do a lot with that, especially after an entire season of everyone arguing about the purpose of God's existence. But this is Platinum End, which means there was never a chance in hell of that happening. Instead, we get the dumbest way to accidentally create a new theology ever conceived.    Shuji, despite being an edgelord teen who read and worshiped Super Atheist Yoneda and his mad cool Facts and Logic, never ran into that old canard about omnipotence. You know the one: “If God can do anything, can God make a rock so heavy even he can't lift it?” Instead, after mulling over the entire spectrum of human experience on a cosmic scale, he comes up with “If God is real, he should kill himself to prove it.” And without a second thought just goes for it. Giving us the amazing line you see up in the review image.    Yes, that's right, God commits suicide in order to see what will happen, and wouldn't you know it, turns out he was a load-bearing pillar of all Earthly life! D'oh! Thus every single living thing on the planet vanishes from existence. In their final moments, Saki and Mirai decide that they had a pretty good run and are happy to die at the whims of the teenager they forced to become God. Yoneda, meanwhile, decides he was right all along and that God and his angels were actually an extinction-level weapon created by human imagination to achieve Armageddon. I guess even in the face of imminent non-existence, dude just has to have the last word. Then, as we zoom out from the dead husk of Earth, in one final stupid twist, it turns out both humans and God were put there by some nameless race of immortal cosmic beings, seemingly as a failed simulation to find a way to kill themselves. It's like if somebody got really drunk and tried to explain the ending to Devilman, but it took six months to tell.    And that's how Platinum End calls it a career. I could sit here and attempt to pontificate over what any of this means, of how the creators came to this as the ending, but let's all be real here. This was never planned. The implications or morals or logistics of this entire ending were never thought through. What this finale was is a desperate Hail Mary pass to get somebody, anybody to remember this story for anything besides being an unremarkable failure. And to an extent it succeeded – I'm writing about it right now, after all. So I guess I have to hand it to them.    Ultimately, that's the legacy of this story. It came in with enough of a pedigree to at least have some expectations, immediately squandered them, and proceeded to flail frantically for any sense of identity or purpose. It never found them, and so all it could hope for was that its violent death throes could make it the type of bad story people will at least dunk on across the internet, and just barely managed it through sheer desperation. After 23 episodes of throwing every stupid, bad idea they could at the wall, they finally got a turd to stick at the 11th hour. Congratulations.

Story of Seasons: Pioneers of Olive Town Coming to PlayStation®4 Summer 2022   Apr  9th 2022         LONDON, UK – April 8, 2022 – Marvelous Europe Limited today announced STORY OF SEASONS: Pioneers of Olive Town will be releasing on PlayStation®4 this summer, receiving both a physical and digital release.  Coming to the PS4™ system with HD visuals and the series' signature charm, STORY OF SEASONS: Pioneers of Olive Town will be available as a standard PS4™ physical edition for a RRP of €39.99 / £34.99 with additional details to be announced at a later date. Players can wishlist the title now via the PlayStation Store.  STORY OF SEASONS: Pioneers of Olive Town is the latest charming adventure in the original farming simulation series, STORY OF SEASONS. As eager explorers arrive in Olive Town, a picturesque seaside community on the edge of the untamed frontier, they will work to breathe life back into their grandfather's dilapidated farm. They'll clear the land, repair old facilities, and place new ones wherever they see fit, levelling up their farming skills and crafting a variety of decorations and facilities, from fences and automatic feeders for livestock to sprinklers for crops!

Story of Seasons: Pioneers of Olive Town Coming to PlayStation®4 Summer 2022   Apr  9th 2022         LONDON, UK – April 8, 2022 – Marvelous Europe Limited today announced STORY OF SEASONS: Pioneers of Olive Town will be releasing on PlayStation®4 this summer, receiving both a physical and digital release.  Coming to the PS4™ system with HD visuals and the series' signature charm, STORY OF SEASONS: Pioneers of Olive Town will be available as a standard PS4™ physical edition for a RRP of €39.99 / £34.99 with additional details to be announced at a later date. Players can wishlist the title now via the PlayStation Store.  STORY OF SEASONS: Pioneers of Olive Town is the latest charming adventure in the original farming simulation series, STORY OF SEASONS. As eager explorers arrive in Olive Town, a picturesque seaside community on the edge of the untamed frontier, they will work to breathe life back into their grandfather's dilapidated farm. They'll clear the land, repair old facilities, and place new ones wherever they see fit, levelling up their farming skills and crafting a variety of decorations and facilities, from fences and automatic feeders for livestock to sprinklers for crops! And though it may at first appear to be a sleepy burg, Olive Town is home to dozens of unique characters to befriend when players are ready to take a break from building their dream farm.  Developed by Marvelous, Inc. and published in Europe and Australia by Marvelous Europe, STORY OF SEASONS: Pioneers of Olive Town will launch on the PS4™ system in Summer 2022. This title is currently available for PC via Steam and Nintendo Switch™.

Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout Episode 12  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Fantasy Bishōjo Juniku Ojisan to ?                     Community score: 4.1            My god they actually did it. No, they didn't commit to Tachibana and Jinguuji as a trashboi OTP, but for the first time in possibly the entire show, they actually let our central couple have a sincere moment of connection and vulnerability. And they even managed to extricate that annoying brainwashing part without it getting in the way of the important stuff! Good on ya, show.    Though my (incredibly biased) favorite part of this finale is definitely Schwartz von Lichtenstein Lohengramm of all people having to be the emotionally mature adult in the situation, and straight-up tell Jinguuji that there's nothing wrong or shameful about showing he cares about Tachibana. This boy may be a dipstick in SAO cosplay, but even he knows that It's important to tell your friends how much they mean to you, because otherwise they'll never know. You know you've got some serious emotional hang-ups when a chuuni high-schooler is your relationship counselor.    It's a good thing Jinguuji regains his super strength here, because it turns out he's got a whole airport of baggage he's been carrying around. We'd seen bits and pieces of his past and a less-than-happy family life, but here we see just how deep that all burrowed. He was raised not just in a strict and traditional household, but one that sought to stomp out any perceived weakness or vulnerability in Jinguuji as a child, teaching him that relying on others was shameful, and to remain stoic no matter what. It's a toxic mindset that he only barely escaped thanks to Tachibana's friendship, but it's left him all but incapable of being emotionally honest or vulnerable with anyone. But with the help of Love Doctor Schwartz, and with his only real friendship on the line, he's finally able to open up.    By which I mean he opens up the entire Hoover Dam and floods millions of metric tons of emotions on Tachibana all at once. It's astounding just how long his Friendship Rant goes on without pause, and even more impressive that it so masterfully straddles the line between sincere sentiment and the sardonic humor the show is built upon. You really do get the sense that all the little quirks to Tachibana's personality, from mundane things like how he likes animals, to how much he considers others around him, are important enough to Jinguuji that he's got them all committed to memory. The romantic subtext there is obvious to everyone except Jinguuji himself, but of course we can't actually resolve that, so instead Tachibana just blushes into another dimension at the onslaught of affection. Thus their initial game of Gay Chicken is back in full force, ready to drive both these idiots crazy until they finally admit their feelings.    It's a great punchline to go out on, and only slightly hampered by the need to stretch out the denouement to lead into a potential second season. Not that I'd be unhappy if a sequel happened – one of my biggest disappointments with the show is how its extended cast has largely been left by the wayside, so the idea of Yggie and the other characters all venturing out on their own journeys with the promise of encountering our heroes again is a good one. I'd just prefer if the show hadn't spent quite so long on what amounts to “and their adventures continued!” coda.    On the whole though, Total Fantasy Knockout has been a fun time. It's had its weaker episodes and clunky jokes, but at its best this series could be a crass and loud blast.  I just wish it had been at its best more often than it was, because there are a couple episodes that are total riots, balancing the various characters and punchlines perfectly, while more than a few averaged out to “okay” after meandering around with weak gags for far too long. As it stands it's still a solid comedy, and one of the more entertaining isekai of this season, but I can't give it a particularly strong recommendation. I can, however, hope it does well enough that they actually give us a full Schwartz spin-off.

Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout Episode 12  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Fantasy Bishōjo Juniku Ojisan to ?                     Community score: 4.1            My god they actually did it. No, they didn't commit to Tachibana and Jinguuji as a trashboi OTP, but for the first time in possibly the entire show, they actually let our central couple have a sincere moment of connection and vulnerability. And they even managed to extricate that annoying brainwashing part without it getting in the way of the important stuff! Good on ya, show.    Though my (incredibly biased) favorite part of this finale is definitely Schwartz von Lichtenstein Lohengramm of all people having to be the emotionally mature adult in the situation, and straight-up tell Jinguuji that there's nothing wrong or shameful about showing he cares about Tachibana. This boy may be a dipstick in SAO cosplay, but even he knows that It's important to tell your friends how much they mean to you, because otherwise they'll never know. You know you've got some serious emotional hang-ups when a chuuni high-schooler is your relationship counselor.    It's a good thing Jinguuji regains his super strength here, because it turns out he's got a whole airport of baggage he's been carrying around. We'd seen bits and pieces of his past and a less-than-happy family life, but here we see just how deep that all burrowed. He was raised not just in a strict and traditional household, but one that sought to stomp out any perceived weakness or vulnerability in Jinguuji as a child, teaching him that relying on others was shameful, and to remain stoic no matter what. It's a toxic mindset that he only barely escaped thanks to Tachibana's friendship, but it's left him all but incapable of being emotionally honest or vulnerable with anyone. But with the help of Love Doctor Schwartz, and with his only real friendship on the line, he's finally able to open up.    By which I mean he opens up the entire Hoover Dam and floods millions of metric tons of emotions on Tachibana all at once. It's astounding just how long his Friendship Rant goes on without pause, and even more impressive that it so masterfully straddles the line between sincere sentiment and the sardonic humor the show is built upon. You really do get the sense that all the little quirks to Tachibana's personality, from mundane things like how he likes animals, to how much he considers others around him, are important enough to Jinguuji that he's got them all committed to memory. The romantic subtext there is obvious to everyone except Jinguuji himself, but of course we can't actually resolve that, so instead Tachibana just blushes into another dimension at the onslaught of affection. Thus their initial game of Gay Chicken is back in full force, ready to drive both these idiots crazy until they finally admit their feelings.    It's a great punchline to go out on, and only slightly hampered by the need to stretch out the denouement to lead into a potential second season. Not that I'd be unhappy if a sequel happened – one of my biggest disappointments with the show is how its extended cast has largely been left by the wayside, so the idea of Yggie and the other characters all venturing out on their own journeys with the promise of encountering our heroes again is a good one. I'd just prefer if the show hadn't spent quite so long on what amounts to “and their adventures continued!” coda.    On the whole though, Total Fantasy Knockout has been a fun time. It's had its weaker episodes and clunky jokes, but at its best this series could be a crass and loud blast.  I just wish it had been at its best more often than it was, because there are a couple episodes that are total riots, balancing the various characters and punchlines perfectly, while more than a few averaged out to “okay” after meandering around with weak gags for far too long. As it stands it's still a solid comedy, and one of the more entertaining isekai of this season, but I can't give it a particularly strong recommendation. I can, however, hope it does well enough that they actually give us a full Schwartz spin-off.

Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout Episode 12  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Fantasy Bishōjo Juniku Ojisan to ?                     Community score: 4.1            My god they actually did it. No, they didn't commit to Tachibana and Jinguuji as a trashboi OTP, but for the first time in possibly the entire show, they actually let our central couple have a sincere moment of connection and vulnerability. And they even managed to extricate that annoying brainwashing part without it getting in the way of the important stuff! Good on ya, show.    Though my (incredibly biased) favorite part of this finale is definitely Schwartz von Lichtenstein Lohengramm of all people having to be the emotionally mature adult in the situation, and straight-up tell Jinguuji that there's nothing wrong or shameful about showing he cares about Tachibana. This boy may be a dipstick in SAO cosplay, but even he knows that It's important to tell your friends how much they mean to you, because otherwise they'll never know. You know you've got some serious emotional hang-ups when a chuuni high-schooler is your relationship counselor.    It's a good thing Jinguuji regains his super strength here, because it turns out he's got a whole airport of baggage he's been carrying around. We'd seen bits and pieces of his past and a less-than-happy family life, but here we see just how deep that all burrowed. He was raised not just in a strict and traditional household, but one that sought to stomp out any perceived weakness or vulnerability in Jinguuji as a child, teaching him that relying on others was shameful, and to remain stoic no matter what. It's a toxic mindset that he only barely escaped thanks to Tachibana's friendship, but it's left him all but incapable of being emotionally honest or vulnerable with anyone. But with the help of Love Doctor Schwartz, and with his only real friendship on the line, he's finally able to open up.    By which I mean he opens up the entire Hoover Dam and floods millions of metric tons of emotions on Tachibana all at once. It's astounding just how long his Friendship Rant goes on without pause, and even more impressive that it so masterfully straddles the line between sincere sentiment and the sardonic humor the show is built upon. You really do get the sense that all the little quirks to Tachibana's personality, from mundane things like how he likes animals, to how much he considers others around him, are important enough to Jinguuji that he's got them all committed to memory. The romantic subtext there is obvious to everyone except Jinguuji himself, but of course we can't actually resolve that, so instead Tachibana just blushes into another dimension at the onslaught of affection. Thus their initial game of Gay Chicken is back in full force, ready to drive both these idiots crazy until they finally admit their feelings.    It's a great punchline to go out on, and only slightly hampered by the need to stretch out the denouement to lead into a potential second season. Not that I'd be unhappy if a sequel happened – one of my biggest disappointments with the show is how its extended cast has largely been left by the wayside, so the idea of Yggie and the other characters all venturing out on their own journeys with the promise of encountering our heroes again is a good one. I'd just prefer if the show hadn't spent quite so long on what amounts to “and their adventures continued!” coda.    On the whole though, Total Fantasy Knockout has been a fun time. It's had its weaker episodes and clunky jokes, but at its best this series could be a crass and loud blast.  I just wish it had been at its best more often than it was, because there are a couple episodes that are total riots, balancing the various characters and punchlines perfectly, while more than a few averaged out to “okay” after meandering around with weak gags for far too long. As it stands it's still a solid comedy, and one of the more entertaining isekai of this season, but I can't give it a particularly strong recommendation. I can, however, hope it does well enough that they actually give us a full Schwartz spin-off.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.

To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr  9, 08:20 7 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue.

Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (215 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals.

Police in a Pod can be interesting too.   Couple of Cockoos is from what I've heard more like KanoKari or Domestic girlfriend - a giant train crush that is fascinating too look at.      Back to top                  SHD    Joined: 05 Apr 2015 		    Posts: 1160       Posted: Fri Apr 08, 2022 9:05 am            Huh, really scratching my head at some of these choices. From what I've read of In the Clear Moonlit Dusk and A Sign of Affection, they are as bog-standard as they get, I really fail to see what makes them special. Yes, both have a ""twist"" on the formulas of their genre, except even those twists are old by now, and then they don't really do anything particularly interesting with them. The characters are boring and tropey, the relationships and conflicts are nothing we haven't seen before... yes, I know I'm probably not the target audience here, not being particularly enamored with the genres and tropes in question, but I really don't understand how these are any better than the million other pleasantly drawn shoujo romances that follow the exact same formulas as these and do it neither better nor worse.   Same with Nina the Starry Bride, it's like... why this one in particular? Yes, it's a pleasant manga I guess, if someone is into this genre, but what makes it more special than say, Itsuwari no Freya or Elia to totsukuni no ou or Boukoku no Marguerite (aka Princess Marguerite From The Ruined Country)? All of them do pretty much what Nina the Starry Bride does, and do it better.    Skip to Loafer is really fun though, I look forward to the anime adaptation.

Police in a Pod can be interesting too.   Couple of Cockoos is from what I've heard more like KanoKari or Domestic girlfriend - a giant train crush that is fascinating too look at.      Back to top                  SHD    Joined: 05 Apr 2015 		    Posts: 1160       Posted: Fri Apr 08, 2022 9:05 am            Huh, really scratching my head at some of these choices. From what I've read of In the Clear Moonlit Dusk and A Sign of Affection, they are as bog-standard as they get, I really fail to see what makes them special. Yes, both have a ""twist"" on the formulas of their genre, except even those twists are old by now, and then they don't really do anything particularly interesting with them. The characters are boring and tropey, the relationships and conflicts are nothing we haven't seen before... yes, I know I'm probably not the target audience here, not being particularly enamored with the genres and tropes in question, but I really don't understand how these are any better than the million other pleasantly drawn shoujo romances that follow the exact same formulas as these and do it neither better nor worse.   Same with Nina the Starry Bride, it's like... why this one in particular? Yes, it's a pleasant manga I guess, if someone is into this genre, but what makes it more special than say, Itsuwari no Freya or Elia to totsukuni no ou or Boukoku no Marguerite (aka Princess Marguerite From The Ruined Country)? All of them do pretty much what Nina the Starry Bride does, and do it better.    Skip to Loafer is really fun though, I look forward to the anime adaptation.

Police in a Pod can be interesting too.   Couple of Cockoos is from what I've heard more like KanoKari or Domestic girlfriend - a giant train crush that is fascinating too look at.

From what I've read of In the Clear Moonlit Dusk and A Sign of Affection, they are as bog-standard as they get, I really fail to see what makes them special. Yes, both have a ""twist"" on the formulas of their genre, except even those twists are old by now, and then they don't really do anything particularly interesting with them. The characters are boring and tropey, the relationships and conflicts are nothing we haven't seen before... yes, I know I'm probably not the target audience here, not being particularly enamored with the genres and tropes in question, but I really don't understand how these are any better than the million other pleasantly drawn shoujo romances that follow the exact same formulas as these and do it neither better nor worse.   Same with Nina the Starry Bride, it's like... why this one in particular? Yes, it's a pleasant manga I guess, if someone is into this genre, but what makes it more special than say, Itsuwari no Freya or Elia to totsukuni no ou or Boukoku no Marguerite (aka Princess Marguerite From The Ruined Country)?
