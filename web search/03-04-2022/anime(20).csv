I just really like the writing of this game and even a personality-less MC couldn't change my mind. Heck, I liked how the player finds out her original personality and how she slowly regains it.   Tho this gimmick made a certain route very hard to sit through. It's easier to make fun of a situation when there is MC acting as a wall between what is happening and yourself. My endless frustration with it didn't change the fact that I still made fun of it after finishing the game. It just got harder while playing it.

I had pretty much given up hope already...  Now, this is a good opportunity to replay the first game as well. For some reason, I think this game is underrated in the west despite it often being viewed as a cult classic.  I just really like the writing of this game and even a personality-less MC couldn't change my mind. Heck, I liked how the player finds out her original personality and how she slowly regains it.   Tho this gimmick made a certain route very hard to sit through. It's easier to make fun of a situation when there is MC acting as a wall between what is happening and yourself. My endless frustration with it didn't change the fact that I still made fun of it after finishing the game. It just got harder while playing it.

I had pretty much given up hope already...  Now, this is a good opportunity to replay the first game as well. For some reason, I think this game is underrated in the west despite it often being viewed as a cult classic.  I just really like the writing of this game and even a personality-less MC couldn't change my mind. Heck, I liked how the player finds out her original personality and how she slowly regains it.   Tho this gimmick made a certain route very hard to sit through. It's easier to make fun of a situation when there is MC acting as a wall between what is happening and yourself. My endless frustration with it didn't change the fact that I still made fun of it after finishing the game. It just got harder while playing it.

News Idolland PriPara Smartphone Game Delayed for 3rd Time to This Summer or Fall   posted on 2022-03-31 12:52 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         App's tie-in anime will have preview screening of episode 3 in May    The official website for Idolland PriPara, the smartphone app based on TAKARA TOMY A.R.T.S and syn Sophia's PriPara franchise, announced on Thursday that the game has been delayed once again to later this summer or fall. This is the game's third delay: the game was scheduled to launch in spring 2021, but was delayed for the first time to summer 2021, and then delayed again to spring 2022.    The app's associated anime, which will stream within the app, is the franchise's first new anime in three years. While the anime's regular run will be delayed alongside the app, the anime has so far had online preview screenings of the ""episode 0"" prequel and episode 1 in October. Episode 2 had an online preview screening on January 12. Episode 3 will have a preview screening in May.    The ""virtual idol life app"" from developer syn Sophia lets users create their own custom characters in the PriPara theme park, where anyone can become an idol.    Makoto Moriwaki is returning from the various PriPara television anime series to direct the in-app anime at Tatsunoko Productions, and Michihiro Tsuchiya is also back to supervise the series scripts. In addition to the many returning staff members, Avex Pictures is once again producing the music.    The Pretty Series of projects began with syn Sophia's Pretty Rhythm: Mini Skirt arcade game in 2010. The game inspired four television anime series, as well as five anime films and the spinoff King of Prism franchise. The sequel game PriPara (Prism Paradise) launched in 2014 and inspired four television anime series and four anime films.    The first anime season of Kiratto Pri‚òÜChan premiered in Japan in April 2018. The second season then premiered in April 2019. The show's third season premiered in April 2020 and ended in May 2021. Crunchyroll streamed the anime as it aired.    A new magic-themed television anime, Waccha PriMagi!, premiered in October 2021 to mark the franchise's 10th anniversary. HIDIVE is streaming the series. Sentai Filmworks licensed the series, and it will release it on home video.    Update: Release window corrected. Thanks, nutmegknight.

News Idolland PriPara Smartphone Game Delayed for 3rd Time to This Summer or Fall   posted on 2022-03-31 12:52 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         App's tie-in anime will have preview screening of episode 3 in May    The official website for Idolland PriPara, the smartphone app based on TAKARA TOMY A.R.T.S and syn Sophia's PriPara franchise, announced on Thursday that the game has been delayed once again to later this summer or fall. This is the game's third delay: the game was scheduled to launch in spring 2021, but was delayed for the first time to summer 2021, and then delayed again to spring 2022.    The app's associated anime, which will stream within the app, is the franchise's first new anime in three years. While the anime's regular run will be delayed alongside the app, the anime has so far had online preview screenings of the ""episode 0"" prequel and episode 1 in October. Episode 2 had an online preview screening on January 12. Episode 3 will have a preview screening in May.    The ""virtual idol life app"" from developer syn Sophia lets users create their own custom characters in the PriPara theme park, where anyone can become an idol.    Makoto Moriwaki is returning from the various PriPara television anime series to direct the in-app anime at Tatsunoko Productions, and Michihiro Tsuchiya is also back to supervise the series scripts. In addition to the many returning staff members, Avex Pictures is once again producing the music.    The Pretty Series of projects began with syn Sophia's Pretty Rhythm: Mini Skirt arcade game in 2010. The game inspired four television anime series, as well as five anime films and the spinoff King of Prism franchise. The sequel game PriPara (Prism Paradise) launched in 2014 and inspired four television anime series and four anime films.    The first anime season of Kiratto Pri‚òÜChan premiered in Japan in April 2018. The second season then premiered in April 2019. The show's third season premiered in April 2020 and ended in May 2021. Crunchyroll streamed the anime as it aired.    A new magic-themed television anime, Waccha PriMagi!, premiered in October 2021 to mark the franchise's 10th anniversary. HIDIVE is streaming the series. Sentai Filmworks licensed the series, and it will release it on home video.    Update: Release window corrected. Thanks, nutmegknight.

The phenomenon that first started with Red and Green then continued the next year with the start of Satoshi's adventure with Pikachu, Kasumi, and Takeshi in the original PM anime to the greatness of XY (until they ruined it by making Satoshi.... then made the decision to do it in the next series) with Satoshi Gekkouga and having the Mega Evolution specials with Alan and Lizardon that had the best battles.

When they announced Pokemon 2020 as being what it is, I assumed Ash and Goh would me our main characters for multiple generations but now that a new generation is on the horizon and The show seems to be treating everything as though it's in its final stages, I don't know...   Like at this rate Ash is gonna wind up being the best battle trainer in the world via ranking and like... where do we even take him from there? Lots of people have assumed this would be his last season as the main character and as much as usual framing would make me believe that I'm skeptical because he still has Pikachu, the franchise mascot, and how asinine would it be to just have a new character only to cram a pikachu in the cast somewhere? Much as a 25 year run with the kid and his mons would be a good place to cap things off with him but the anime has always had this weird way of just doing what it wants and chugging along just fine regardless so uh *shrug*   Goh seemed so flexible to me as a character that I could have easily seen him being around for a while or even serving as Ash's replacement as the main character, where Goh would then find some other kid who'd get into battling and the baton would be handed off to them, etc. That doesn't seem to be the case but again, I have no clue. While Chole/Koharu was never promised to us that'd she be like the 3rd lead or anything it does feel pretty criminal that we don't get to have her around as often, as I really like Her and Goh as characters for Ash to travel and bounce off of, kids with a bit more cynicism in em than the usual perfect goodie two shoes (I say this while loving the cast from sun and moon lol)    Over these 25 years of the anime's run I've gone from being a childhood fan, to forgetting about it, to re-involving myself with it, to joining in on the internet hate bandwagon under the guise of ""being critical"", to getting tired of the pointless easy target picking, to now just appreciating and enjoying it for what it is. I feel like I've gone the whole gambit of ways you can feel anything towards this show and all I really have to say now is that I'll always be curious to see what they decide to do next, because right when I thought they found their winning formula with XY and that they would just do repeat variations of that ad nauseum, they really switched things up and made one of (if not the depending on my mood) my favorite installments of the show and have really been playing around a bit with what they can do with the show, while keeping it simple and episodic. For some reason I can't help but look back and see all of the little ways the show has changed itself from then to now and find it all really interesting.

Or at least Discotec may recover the original lisence, one can dream.         Not happening, even the Pokemon Company still follow most of 4Kids' localization standards to this very day, likely because it worked wonder to them to this day.   The more melancholic, mature (as in less for little kids, and more for all ages) and atmospheric side of the Japanese version has had for most of its run, can barely be seen with glimpses during the English localization, and nearly all countries in the West got their localizations out of 4Kids' too.   Instead we get a version that to this day cannot bear to have barely a second of silence during any scene, for the kids not to have their short attention spam drawn away from the show (thus why to this day, whenever a scene would have no music playing in the background, the localization would insert some stupid zanny background noise/music).   Not to mention the Japanese version at times had some risk√© jokes that weren't quite as child friendly, something the IP tries to protect with all it can worldwide, to the point of infantilizing the editing (for the anime only, the games still have quite a few sexual innuendos and alike). Oh, right, there was a site way back in the day that used to compare both versions and translate trivia, if I remember which I can link it.

The phenomenon that first started with Red and Green then continued the next year with the start of Satoshi's adventure with Pikachu, Kasumi, and Takeshi in the original PM anime to the greatness of XY (until they ruined it by making Satoshi.... then made the decision to do it in the next series) with Satoshi Gekkouga and having the Mega Evolution specials with Alan and Lizardon that had the best battles.

Have to admit, seeing all the seasons and Ash/Satoshi's Pokemon together really hit me in the feels.

When they announced Pokemon 2020 as being what it is, I assumed Ash and Goh would me our main characters for multiple generations but now that a new generation is on the horizon and The show seems to be treating everything as though it's in its final stages, I don't know...   Like at this rate Ash is gonna wind up being the best battle trainer in the world via ranking and like... where do we even take him from there? Lots of people have assumed this would be his last season as the main character and as much as usual framing would make me believe that I'm skeptical because he still has Pikachu, the franchise mascot, and how asinine would it be to just have a new character only to cram a pikachu in the cast somewhere? Much as a 25 year run with the kid and his mons would be a good place to cap things off with him but the anime has always had this weird way of just doing what it wants and chugging along just fine regardless so uh *shrug*   Goh seemed so flexible to me as a character that I could have easily seen him being around for a while or even serving as Ash's replacement as the main character, where Goh would then find some other kid who'd get into battling and the baton would be handed off to them, etc. That doesn't seem to be the case but again, I have no clue. While Chole/Koharu was never promised to us that'd she be like the 3rd lead or anything it does feel pretty criminal that we don't get to have her around as often, as I really like Her and Goh as characters for Ash to travel and bounce off of, kids with a bit more cynicism in em than the usual perfect goodie two shoes (I say this while loving the cast from sun and moon lol)    Over these 25 years of the anime's run I've gone from being a childhood fan, to forgetting about it, to re-involving myself with it, to joining in on the internet hate bandwagon under the guise of ""being critical"", to getting tired of the pointless easy target picking, to now just appreciating and enjoying it for what it is. I feel like I've gone the whole gambit of ways you can feel anything towards this show and all I really have to say now is that I'll always be curious to see what they decide to do next, because right when I thought they found their winning formula with XY and that they would just do repeat variations of that ad nauseum, they really switched things up and made one of (if not the depending on my mood) my favorite installments of the show and have really been playing around a bit with what they can do with the show, while keeping it simple and episodic. For some reason I can't help but look back and see all of the little ways the show has changed itself from then to now and find it all really interesting.

Or at least Discotec may recover the original lisence, one can dream.         Not happening, even the Pokemon Company still follow most of 4Kids' localization standards to this very day, likely because it worked wonder to them to this day.   The more melancholic, mature (as in less for little kids, and more for all ages) and atmospheric side of the Japanese version has had for most of its run, can barely be seen with glimpses during the English localization, and nearly all countries in the West got their localizations out of 4Kids' too.   Instead we get a version that to this day cannot bear to have barely a second of silence during any scene, for the kids not to have their short attention spam drawn away from the show (thus why to this day, whenever a scene would have no music playing in the background, the localization would insert some stupid zanny background noise/music).   Not to mention the Japanese version at times had some risk√© jokes that weren't quite as child friendly, something the IP tries to protect with all it can worldwide, to the point of infantilizing the editing (for the anime only, the games still have quite a few sexual innuendos and alike). Oh, right, there was a site way back in the day that used to compare both versions and translate trivia, if I remember which I can link it.

The phenomenon that first started with Red and Green then continued the next year with the start of Satoshi's adventure with Pikachu, Kasumi, and Takeshi in the original PM anime to the greatness of XY (until they ruined it by making Satoshi.... then made the decision to do it in the next series) with Satoshi Gekkouga and having the Mega Evolution specials with Alan and Lizardon that had the best battles.

Have to admit, seeing all the seasons and Ash/Satoshi's Pokemon together really hit me in the feels.      Back to top                  Thatguy3331    Joined: 18 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 1732       Posted: Sat Apr 02, 2022 6:18 am            The anime feels like it's at it's most unpredictable right now. When they announced Pokemon 2020 as being what it is, I assumed Ash and Goh would me our main characters for multiple generations but now that a new generation is on the horizon and The show seems to be treating everything as though it's in its final stages, I don't know...   Like at this rate Ash is gonna wind up being the best battle trainer in the world via ranking and like... where do we even take him from there? Lots of people have assumed this would be his last season as the main character and as much as usual framing would make me believe that I'm skeptical because he still has Pikachu, the franchise mascot, and how asinine would it be to just have a new character only to cram a pikachu in the cast somewhere? Much as a 25 year run with the kid and his mons would be a good place to cap things off with him but the anime has always had this weird way of just doing what it wants and chugging along just fine regardless so uh *shrug*   Goh seemed so flexible to me as a character that I could have easily seen him being around for a while or even serving as Ash's replacement as the main character, where Goh would then find some other kid who'd get into battling and the baton would be handed off to them, etc. That doesn't seem to be the case but again, I have no clue. While Chole/Koharu was never promised to us that'd she be like the 3rd lead or anything it does feel pretty criminal that we don't get to have her around as often, as I really like Her and Goh as characters for Ash to travel and bounce off of, kids with a bit more cynicism in em than the usual perfect goodie two shoes (I say this while loving the cast from sun and moon lol)    Over these 25 years of the anime's run I've gone from being a childhood fan, to forgetting about it, to re-involving myself with it, to joining in on the internet hate bandwagon under the guise of ""being critical"", to getting tired of the pointless easy target picking, to now just appreciating and enjoying it for what it is. I feel like I've gone the whole gambit of ways you can feel anything towards this show and all I really have to say now is that I'll always be curious to see what they decide to do next, because right when I thought they found their winning formula with XY and that they would just do repeat variations of that ad nauseum, they really switched things up and made one of (if not the depending on my mood) my favorite installments of the show and have really been playing around a bit with what they can do with the show, while keeping it simple and episodic. For some reason I can't help but look back and see all of the little ways the show has changed itself from then to now and find it all really interesting.

Or at least Discotec may recover the original lisence, one can dream.         Not happening, even the Pokemon Company still follow most of 4Kids' localization standards to this very day, likely because it worked wonder to them to this day.   The more melancholic, mature (as in less for little kids, and more for all ages) and atmospheric side of the Japanese version has had for most of its run, can barely be seen with glimpses during the English localization, and nearly all countries in the West got their localizations out of 4Kids' too.   Instead we get a version that to this day cannot bear to have barely a second of silence during any scene, for the kids not to have their short attention spam drawn away from the show (thus why to this day, whenever a scene would have no music playing in the background, the localization would insert some stupid zanny background noise/music).   Not to mention the Japanese version at times had some risk√© jokes that weren't quite as child friendly, something the IP tries to protect with all it can worldwide, to the point of infantilizing the editing (for the anime only, the games still have quite a few sexual innuendos and alike). Oh, right, there was a site way back in the day that used to compare both versions and translate trivia, if I remember which I can link it.

When they announced Pokemon 2020 as being what it is, I assumed Ash and Goh would me our main characters for multiple generations but now that a new generation is on the horizon and The show seems to be treating everything as though it's in its final stages, I don't know...   Like at this rate Ash is gonna wind up being the best battle trainer in the world via ranking and like... where do we even take him from there? Lots of people have assumed this would be his last season as the main character and as much as usual framing would make me believe that I'm skeptical because he still has Pikachu, the franchise mascot, and how asinine would it be to just have a new character only to cram a pikachu in the cast somewhere? Much as a 25 year run with the kid and his mons would be a good place to cap things off with him but the anime has always had this weird way of just doing what it wants and chugging along just fine regardless so uh *shrug*   Goh seemed so flexible to me as a character that I could have easily seen him being around for a while or even serving as Ash's replacement as the main character, where Goh would then find some other kid who'd get into battling and the baton would be handed off to them, etc. That doesn't seem to be the case but again, I have no clue. While Chole/Koharu was never promised to us that'd she be like the 3rd lead or anything it does feel pretty criminal that we don't get to have her around as often, as I really like Her and Goh as characters for Ash to travel and bounce off of, kids with a bit more cynicism in em than the usual perfect goodie two shoes (I say this while loving the cast from sun and moon lol)    Over these 25 years of the anime's run I've gone from being a childhood fan, to forgetting about it, to re-involving myself with it, to joining in on the internet hate bandwagon under the guise of ""being critical"", to getting tired of the pointless easy target picking, to now just appreciating and enjoying it for what it is. I feel like I've gone the whole gambit of ways you can feel anything towards this show and all I really have to say now is that I'll always be curious to see what they decide to do next, because right when I thought they found their winning formula with XY and that they would just do repeat variations of that ad nauseum, they really switched things up and made one of (if not the depending on my mood) my favorite installments of the show and have really been playing around a bit with what they can do with the show, while keeping it simple and episodic. For some reason I can't help but look back and see all of the little ways the show has changed itself from then to now and find it all really interesting.

Or at least Discotec may recover the original lisence, one can dream.         Not happening, even the Pokemon Company still follow most of 4Kids' localization standards to this very day, likely because it worked wonder to them to this day.   The more melancholic, mature (as in less for little kids, and more for all ages) and atmospheric side of the Japanese version has had for most of its run, can barely be seen with glimpses during the English localization, and nearly all countries in the West got their localizations out of 4Kids' too.   Instead we get a version that to this day cannot bear to have barely a second of silence during any scene, for the kids not to have their short attention spam drawn away from the show (thus why to this day, whenever a scene would have no music playing in the background, the localization would insert some stupid zanny background noise/music).   Not to mention the Japanese version at times had some risk√© jokes that weren't quite as child friendly, something the IP tries to protect with all it can worldwide, to the point of infantilizing the editing (for the anime only, the games still have quite a few sexual innuendos and alike). Oh, right, there was a site way back in the day that used to compare both versions and translate trivia, if I remember which I can link it.

Much as a 25 year run with the kid and his mons would be a good place to cap things off with him but the anime has always had this weird way of just doing what it wants and chugging along just fine regardless so uh *shrug*   Goh seemed so flexible to me as a character that I could have easily seen him being around for a while or even serving as Ash's replacement as the main character, where Goh would then find some other kid who'd get into battling and the baton would be handed off to them, etc. That doesn't seem to be the case but again, I have no clue. While Chole/Koharu was never promised to us that'd she be like the 3rd lead or anything it does feel pretty criminal that we don't get to have her around as often, as I really like Her and Goh as characters for Ash to travel and bounce off of, kids with a bit more cynicism in em than the usual perfect goodie two shoes (I say this while loving the cast from sun and moon lol)    Over these 25 years of the anime's run I've gone from being a childhood fan, to forgetting about it, to re-involving myself with it, to joining in on the internet hate bandwagon under the guise of ""being critical"", to getting tired of the pointless easy target picking, to now just appreciating and enjoying it for what it is. I feel like I've gone the whole gambit of ways you can feel anything towards this show and all I really have to say now is that I'll always be curious to see what they decide to do next, because right when I thought they found their winning formula with XY and that they would just do repeat variations of that ad nauseum, they really switched things up and made one of (if not the depending on my mood) my favorite installments of the show and have really been playing around a bit with what they can do with the show, while keeping it simple and episodic. For some reason I can't help but look back and see all of the little ways the show has changed itself from then to now and find it all really interesting.

Did you know, not everyone hit by a truck in anime gets sent to some fantasy world? Some just die.   Things to learn from this:  1. Remember to look both ways before crossing the street.  2. Do not stand in the street.  3. If you see someone else in the street that is about to get struck, your chances of saving them is low, and it is possible that the accident will instead have 2 casualties instead of 1.  4. Death is not a revolving door or a transportation device to another world.  5. If you think truck-kun is after you, best to become a hikikomori. Your chances for survival increase dramatically.

Unfortunate though that some ‚Äúparents‚Äù refuse to do this sometimes leaving it up for the kids to do so themselves ‚Äúhopefully‚Äù.

Quote:    It is not suicide, it is going to start a new life.               idea of afterlife is present in most major religions and systems of belief for millennia. We should never restrict fiction on the basis on someone's kid being brought up without any common sense. I've heard of cases of children trying to fly like superheroes do and dying or almost dying, will you lobby to remove flying from common superpowers as well?

Did you know, not everyone hit by a truck in anime gets sent to some fantasy world? Some just die.   Things to learn from this:  1. Remember to look both ways before crossing the street.  2. Do not stand in the street.  3. If you see someone else in the street that is about to get struck, your chances of saving them is low, and it is possible that the accident will instead have 2 casualties instead of 1.  4. Death is not a revolving door or a transportation device to another world.  5. If you think truck-kun is after you, best to become a hikikomori. Your chances for survival increase dramatically.

Did you know, not everyone hit by a truck in anime gets sent to some fantasy world? Some just die.   Things to learn from this:  1. Remember to look both ways before crossing the street.  2. Do not stand in the street.  3. If you see someone else in the street that is about to get struck, your chances of saving them is low, and it is possible that the accident will instead have 2 casualties instead of 1.  4. Death is not a revolving door or a transportation device to another world.  5. If you think truck-kun is after you, best to become a hikikomori. Your chances for survival increase dramatically.

Did you know, not everyone hit by a truck in anime gets sent to some fantasy world? Some just die.   Things to learn from this:  1. Remember to look both ways before crossing the street.  2. Do not stand in the street.  3. If you see someone else in the street that is about to get struck, your chances of saving them is low, and it is possible that the accident will instead have 2 casualties instead of 1.  4. Death is not a revolving door or a transportation device to another world.  5. If you think truck-kun is after you, best to become a hikikomori. Your chances for survival increase dramatically.

Did you know, not everyone hit by a truck in anime gets sent to some fantasy world? Some just die.   Things to learn from this:  1. Remember to look both ways before crossing the street.  2. Do not stand in the street.  3. If you see someone else in the street that is about to get struck, your chances of saving them is low, and it is possible that the accident will instead have 2 casualties instead of 1.  4. Death is not a revolving door or a transportation device to another world.  5. If you think truck-kun is after you, best to become a hikikomori. Your chances for survival increase dramatically.

Did you know, not everyone hit by a truck in anime gets sent to some fantasy world? Some just die.   Things to learn from this:  1. Remember to look both ways before crossing the street.  2. Do not stand in the street.  3. If you see someone else in the street that is about to get struck, your chances of saving them is low, and it is possible that the accident will instead have 2 casualties instead of 1.  4. Death is not a revolving door or a transportation device to another world.  5. If you think truck-kun is after you, best to become a hikikomori. Your chances for survival increase dramatically.

News Gundam: Cucuruz Doan's Island Film Reveals Southern Cross Team's Cast   posted on 2022-03-31 09:50 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Yuu Hayashi, Shizuka Itou, Atsushi Miyauchi, Y≈çji Ueda, Koji Yusa play elite Zeon unit    The official Twitter account for the Mobile Suit Gundam: Cucuruz Doan's Island (Kid≈ç Senshi Gundam: Cucuruz Doan no Shima) anime film revealed the cast as well as character and mobile suit visuals for the film's Southern Cross team. An elite unit of which the titular Cucuruz Doan was once a member, the Southern Cross team is also infamous among Federation forces. The team has both veteran members who resent Doan's desertion, as well as new members who have joined in admiration of the unit's reputation.     The cast includes (bottom row, left to right in image above) Yuu Hayashi as the team's bellicose new member Danan Rashica who admires Doan, Shizuka Itou as Selma Levens who thinks their current leader does not compare to Doan, Atsushi Miyauchi as the team's leader Egba Atler who detests Doan, Y≈çji Ueda as the team's deputy leader and sniper Wald Ren, and Koji Yusa as Yun Sanho.    The team members all fields MS-06GD Zaku mobile suits with increased leg thrusters for enhanced  maneuverability and custom loadouts.    The previously announced cast includes:    Toru Furuya as Amuro Ray   Shunsuke Takeuchi as Cucuruz Doan    Ken Narita as Bright Noa    Satomi Arai as Mirai Yashima    Megumi Han as Sayla Mass    Toshio Furukawa as Kai Shiden    Hideki Nakanishi as Hayato Kobayashi    Misato Fukuen as Fraw Bow    Tomofumi Ikezoe as Sleggar Law    The film's original announcement described the film as a retelling of the 15th episode of the original Mobile Suit Gundam television anime. The episode itself has been omitted from English releases of the series.    The story is set after the Federation defense of Jaburo, with the Federation planning to renew offensives on Zeon's invasion headquarters in Odessa. Amuro and the White Base head to Belfast to resupply, but the White Base receives new orders: to head to the ""Island of No Return"" to search and destroy any Zeon stragglers. Amuro set out on the island in search of Zeon spies, but find  a group of children and a Zaku mobile suit on the supposedly uninhabited island. With the Gundam left behind, Amuro encounters a man who calls himself Cucuruz Doan. After uncovering the secret of the island, Amuro attempts to make his way back to the Gundam to escape.    Manga creator and animator Yoshikazu Yasuhiko directs the film, and is also credited with the character designs alongside Atsushi Tamura (Weathering With You) and Tsukasa Kotobuki (Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin, Saber Marionette J). Yasuhiko had revealed in June that he was working on an unannounced anime film. Ka Hee Im is credited as assistant director. Toshizo Nemoto (Macross Delta) is penning the script. Longtime Gundam mechanical designers Kunio Okawara, Hajime Katoki, and Kimitoshi Yamane are credited for mechanical design in the film. Takayuki Hattori (Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin) is composing the music.    Y≈´ji Kaneko is the art director, while Nagisa Abe is the color key artist. Takeshi Katsurayama and Ry≈ç Iijima are the compositing directors of photography. Shuhei Morita is the CGI line director, and Morihito Abe is the CGI director. Kazuhiro Nii is editing, and Sadayoshi Fujino is the sound director.    The film will open on June 3.    Junji ≈åno's Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin MSD: Cucuruz Doan no Shima (Mobile Suit Gundam The Origin MSD: Cucuruz Doan's Island) manga (pictured at right) launched in Kadokawa's Gundam Ace magazine in May 2016, and ended in May 2019. The manga has a total of five volumes.    The manga is a spinoff of Yoshikazu Yasuhiko's Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin manga. The manga tells the story of Cucuruz Doan, a character who appeared in the similarly-titled 15th episode of Yoshiyuki Tomino's original Mobile Suit Gundam anime series. In the episode, the titular character is a Zeon pilot who abandoned his post after refusing an order.    Yasuhiko's Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin manga is also inspired by and re-imagines the original Mobile Suit Gundam series. Viz Media published part of the manga in North America from 2002 to 2004, before it halted publication of the series. Vertical licensed the series in 2013, and released all 12 volumes.    The manga inspired a six-episode anime project in Japanese theaters from 2015 to 2018. Yasuhiko worked as chief director, character designer, and storyboarder for the anime. A 13-episode television series recompilation of the anime premiered in April 2019.

News Gundam: Cucuruz Doan's Island Film Reveals Southern Cross Team's Cast   posted on 2022-03-31 09:50 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Yuu Hayashi, Shizuka Itou, Atsushi Miyauchi, Y≈çji Ueda, Koji Yusa play elite Zeon unit    The official Twitter account for the Mobile Suit Gundam: Cucuruz Doan's Island (Kid≈ç Senshi Gundam: Cucuruz Doan no Shima) anime film revealed the cast as well as character and mobile suit visuals for the film's Southern Cross team. An elite unit of which the titular Cucuruz Doan was once a member, the Southern Cross team is also infamous among Federation forces. The team has both veteran members who resent Doan's desertion, as well as new members who have joined in admiration of the unit's reputation.     The cast includes (bottom row, left to right in image above) Yuu Hayashi as the team's bellicose new member Danan Rashica who admires Doan, Shizuka Itou as Selma Levens who thinks their current leader does not compare to Doan, Atsushi Miyauchi as the team's leader Egba Atler who detests Doan, Y≈çji Ueda as the team's deputy leader and sniper Wald Ren, and Koji Yusa as Yun Sanho.    The team members all fields MS-06GD Zaku mobile suits with increased leg thrusters for enhanced  maneuverability and custom loadouts.    The previously announced cast includes:    Toru Furuya as Amuro Ray   Shunsuke Takeuchi as Cucuruz Doan    Ken Narita as Bright Noa    Satomi Arai as Mirai Yashima    Megumi Han as Sayla Mass    Toshio Furukawa as Kai Shiden    Hideki Nakanishi as Hayato Kobayashi    Misato Fukuen as Fraw Bow    Tomofumi Ikezoe as Sleggar Law    The film's original announcement described the film as a retelling of the 15th episode of the original Mobile Suit Gundam television anime. The episode itself has been omitted from English releases of the series.    The story is set after the Federation defense of Jaburo, with the Federation planning to renew offensives on Zeon's invasion headquarters in Odessa. Amuro and the White Base head to Belfast to resupply, but the White Base receives new orders: to head to the ""Island of No Return"" to search and destroy any Zeon stragglers. Amuro set out on the island in search of Zeon spies, but find  a group of children and a Zaku mobile suit on the supposedly uninhabited island. With the Gundam left behind, Amuro encounters a man who calls himself Cucuruz Doan. After uncovering the secret of the island, Amuro attempts to make his way back to the Gundam to escape.    Manga creator and animator Yoshikazu Yasuhiko directs the film, and is also credited with the character designs alongside Atsushi Tamura (Weathering With You) and Tsukasa Kotobuki (Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin, Saber Marionette J). Yasuhiko had revealed in June that he was working on an unannounced anime film. Ka Hee Im is credited as assistant director. Toshizo Nemoto (Macross Delta) is penning the script. Longtime Gundam mechanical designers Kunio Okawara, Hajime Katoki, and Kimitoshi Yamane are credited for mechanical design in the film. Takayuki Hattori (Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin) is composing the music.    Y≈´ji Kaneko is the art director, while Nagisa Abe is the color key artist. Takeshi Katsurayama and Ry≈ç Iijima are the compositing directors of photography. Shuhei Morita is the CGI line director, and Morihito Abe is the CGI director. Kazuhiro Nii is editing, and Sadayoshi Fujino is the sound director.    The film will open on June 3.    Junji ≈åno's Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin MSD: Cucuruz Doan no Shima (Mobile Suit Gundam The Origin MSD: Cucuruz Doan's Island) manga (pictured at right) launched in Kadokawa's Gundam Ace magazine in May 2016, and ended in May 2019. The manga has a total of five volumes.    The manga is a spinoff of Yoshikazu Yasuhiko's Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin manga. The manga tells the story of Cucuruz Doan, a character who appeared in the similarly-titled 15th episode of Yoshiyuki Tomino's original Mobile Suit Gundam anime series. In the episode, the titular character is a Zeon pilot who abandoned his post after refusing an order.    Yasuhiko's Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin manga is also inspired by and re-imagines the original Mobile Suit Gundam series. Viz Media published part of the manga in North America from 2002 to 2004, before it halted publication of the series. Vertical licensed the series in 2013, and released all 12 volumes.    The manga inspired a six-episode anime project in Japanese theaters from 2015 to 2018. Yasuhiko worked as chief director, character designer, and storyboarder for the anime. A 13-episode television series recompilation of the anime premiered in April 2019.

News Gundam: Cucuruz Doan's Island Film Reveals Southern Cross Team's Cast   posted on 2022-03-31 09:50 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Yuu Hayashi, Shizuka Itou, Atsushi Miyauchi, Y≈çji Ueda, Koji Yusa play elite Zeon unit    The official Twitter account for the Mobile Suit Gundam: Cucuruz Doan's Island (Kid≈ç Senshi Gundam: Cucuruz Doan no Shima) anime film revealed the cast as well as character and mobile suit visuals for the film's Southern Cross team. An elite unit of which the titular Cucuruz Doan was once a member, the Southern Cross team is also infamous among Federation forces. The team has both veteran members who resent Doan's desertion, as well as new members who have joined in admiration of the unit's reputation.     The cast includes (bottom row, left to right in image above) Yuu Hayashi as the team's bellicose new member Danan Rashica who admires Doan, Shizuka Itou as Selma Levens who thinks their current leader does not compare to Doan, Atsushi Miyauchi as the team's leader Egba Atler who detests Doan, Y≈çji Ueda as the team's deputy leader and sniper Wald Ren, and Koji Yusa as Yun Sanho.    The team members all fields MS-06GD Zaku mobile suits with increased leg thrusters for enhanced  maneuverability and custom loadouts.    The previously announced cast includes:    Toru Furuya as Amuro Ray   Shunsuke Takeuchi as Cucuruz Doan    Ken Narita as Bright Noa    Satomi Arai as Mirai Yashima    Megumi Han as Sayla Mass    Toshio Furukawa as Kai Shiden    Hideki Nakanishi as Hayato Kobayashi    Misato Fukuen as Fraw Bow    Tomofumi Ikezoe as Sleggar Law    The film's original announcement described the film as a retelling of the 15th episode of the original Mobile Suit Gundam television anime. The episode itself has been omitted from English releases of the series.    The story is set after the Federation defense of Jaburo, with the Federation planning to renew offensives on Zeon's invasion headquarters in Odessa. Amuro and the White Base head to Belfast to resupply, but the White Base receives new orders: to head to the ""Island of No Return"" to search and destroy any Zeon stragglers. Amuro set out on the island in search of Zeon spies, but find  a group of children and a Zaku mobile suit on the supposedly uninhabited island. With the Gundam left behind, Amuro encounters a man who calls himself Cucuruz Doan. After uncovering the secret of the island, Amuro attempts to make his way back to the Gundam to escape.    Manga creator and animator Yoshikazu Yasuhiko directs the film, and is also credited with the character designs alongside Atsushi Tamura (Weathering With You) and Tsukasa Kotobuki (Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin, Saber Marionette J). Yasuhiko had revealed in June that he was working on an unannounced anime film. Ka Hee Im is credited as assistant director. Toshizo Nemoto (Macross Delta) is penning the script. Longtime Gundam mechanical designers Kunio Okawara, Hajime Katoki, and Kimitoshi Yamane are credited for mechanical design in the film. Takayuki Hattori (Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin) is composing the music.    Y≈´ji Kaneko is the art director, while Nagisa Abe is the color key artist. Takeshi Katsurayama and Ry≈ç Iijima are the compositing directors of photography. Shuhei Morita is the CGI line director, and Morihito Abe is the CGI director. Kazuhiro Nii is editing, and Sadayoshi Fujino is the sound director.    The film will open on June 3.    Junji ≈åno's Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin MSD: Cucuruz Doan no Shima (Mobile Suit Gundam The Origin MSD: Cucuruz Doan's Island) manga (pictured at right) launched in Kadokawa's Gundam Ace magazine in May 2016, and ended in May 2019. The manga has a total of five volumes.    The manga is a spinoff of Yoshikazu Yasuhiko's Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin manga. The manga tells the story of Cucuruz Doan, a character who appeared in the similarly-titled 15th episode of Yoshiyuki Tomino's original Mobile Suit Gundam anime series. In the episode, the titular character is a Zeon pilot who abandoned his post after refusing an order.    Yasuhiko's Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin manga is also inspired by and re-imagines the original Mobile Suit Gundam series. Viz Media published part of the manga in North America from 2002 to 2004, before it halted publication of the series. Vertical licensed the series in 2013, and released all 12 volumes.    The manga inspired a six-episode anime project in Japanese theaters from 2015 to 2018. Yasuhiko worked as chief director, character designer, and storyboarder for the anime. A 13-episode television series recompilation of the anime premiered in April 2019.

The episode itself has been omitted from English releases of the series.    The story is set after the Federation defense of Jaburo, with the Federation planning to renew offensives on Zeon's invasion headquarters in Odessa. Amuro and the White Base head to Belfast to resupply, but the White Base receives new orders: to head to the ""Island of No Return"" to search and destroy any Zeon stragglers. Amuro set out on the island in search of Zeon spies, but find  a group of children and a Zaku mobile suit on the supposedly uninhabited island. With the Gundam left behind, Amuro encounters a man who calls himself Cucuruz Doan. After uncovering the secret of the island, Amuro attempts to make his way back to the Gundam to escape.    Manga creator and animator Yoshikazu Yasuhiko directs the film, and is also credited with the character designs alongside Atsushi Tamura (Weathering With You) and Tsukasa Kotobuki (Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin, Saber Marionette J). Yasuhiko had revealed in June that he was working on an unannounced anime film. Ka Hee Im is credited as assistant director. Toshizo Nemoto (Macross Delta) is penning the script. Longtime Gundam mechanical designers Kunio Okawara, Hajime Katoki, and Kimitoshi Yamane are credited for mechanical design in the film.

Takeshi Katsurayama and Ry≈ç Iijima are the compositing directors of photography. Shuhei Morita is the CGI line director, and Morihito Abe is the CGI director. Kazuhiro Nii is editing, and Sadayoshi Fujino is the sound director.    The film will open on June 3.    Junji ≈åno's Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin MSD: Cucuruz Doan no Shima (Mobile Suit Gundam The Origin MSD: Cucuruz Doan's Island) manga (pictured at right) launched in Kadokawa's Gundam Ace magazine in May 2016, and ended in May 2019. The manga has a total of five volumes.    The manga is a spinoff of Yoshikazu Yasuhiko's Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin manga. The manga tells the story of Cucuruz Doan, a character who appeared in the similarly-titled 15th episode of Yoshiyuki Tomino's original Mobile Suit Gundam anime series. In the episode, the titular character is a Zeon pilot who abandoned his post after refusing an order.    Yasuhiko's Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin manga is also inspired by and re-imagines the original Mobile Suit Gundam series. Viz Media published part of the manga in North America from 2002 to 2004, before it halted publication of the series. Vertical licensed the series in 2013, and released all 12 volumes.    The manga inspired a six-episode anime project in Japanese theaters from 2015 to 2018. Yasuhiko worked as chief director, character designer, and storyboarder for the anime. A 13-episode television series recompilation of the anime premiered in April 2019.

There are much worse problems to have.                    ep. review          35 comments       Love of Kill ‚Äí Episode 9   Mar 15, 00:30 35 comments                 anime    The curtain to the show's prevailing mysteries are finally starting to be pulled back, and some of the revelations we get this episode are very intriguing.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‚Äí Episode 10   Mar 14, 23:30 45 comments                 anime    Cayna's characterization in recent episodes have brought out the quirky, doting motherly side that I think Leadale has always been trying to show but got lost in her unjustified anger-filled outbursts.                    ep. review          86 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‚Äí Episode 21   Mar 12, 03:30 86 comments                 anime    Louis' death affected more people than just him, and one other very, very specifically: Dominique, his sister.                    ep. review          177 comments       Ranking of Kings ‚Äí Episodes 20-21   Mar 12, 02:30 177 comments                 anime    I don't think it's an exaggeration to say this series, and this episode in particular, will serve as inspiration for years to come.                    ep. review          44 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‚Äí Episode 9   Mar 12, 01:30 44 comments                 anime    It's time for another action-centric episode of Arifureta. Say what you want, but this is where the story really gets to show off.                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‚Äí Episode 22   Mar 12, 00:30 107 comments                 anime    Yoneda and his interminably stupid Genius Atheist shtick has sucked up every molecule of oxygen in this show since he first opened his mouth.                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‚Äí Episode 9   Mar 11, 03:30 19 comments                 anime    The show finally digs into something really, really cool: Ojiro and Kazuki's backstory, which was thuddingly hinted at in the final moments of episode 8.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‚Äí Episode 9   Mar 11, 02:30 14 comments                 anime    Where the present-day story of Tokyo 24th Ward has been about extreme expressions of socio-politics informed by technology, this flashback sees the characters more directly grappling with tech's impact on that society.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‚Äí Episode 9   Mar 10, 02:30 89 comments                 anime    Wein is, by design, an overpowering presence in the story. He is smarter and more skilled than everyone else. However, that's not to say he doesn't have weaknesses.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‚Äí Episode 9   Mar 10, 01:31 51 comments                 anime    Sometimes, when putting a story together, you just want to riff on the final act of Terminator 2, and that's valid. Sabikui Bisco certainly wears its influences on its sleeve as it catapults into yet another climax.                    ep. review          48 comments       Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout ‚Äí Episodes 8-9   Mar 10, 00:30 48 comments                 anime    While there are a few funny moments or chuckle-worthy faces hidden in there, the first half of the episode is just one big joke about how Shen is totally trying to assault Jinguuji, and it's a rough sit.                    ep. review          58 comments       Sasaki and Miyano ‚Äí Episode 9   Mar  9, 05:30 58 comments                 anime    What started off as largely obligation has become a chance for Miyano to explore his own anxieties about his appearance in a relatively safe ‚Äì yet still public ‚Äì situation.                    ep. review          76 comments       Princess Connect!

Given that we're also talking about an isekai with harem elements, I was basically in full Brace For Impact mode when this episode started.                    ep. review          156 comments       Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ‚Äí Episode 84   Mar  8, 09:30 156 comments                 anime    Jean's betrayal of Floch and the Jeagerists doesn't just make for a convenient way to get the different characters in one place; it is a culmination of his entire character arc.                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‚Äí Episode 9   Mar  8, 08:30 18 comments                 anime    The series continues to be incredibly charming, and reminds me that sometimes, slowing down and enjoying the ebb and flow of life ‚Äì and maybe having some good fish ‚Äì is the way to go.                    ep. review          42 comments       Requiem of the Rose King ‚Äí Episode 9   Mar  8, 07:30 42 comments                 anime    Richard tries to make a sacrifice to prevent familial slaughter but it may not be enough to circumvent this slow-motion tragedy.                    ep. review          101 comments       World's End Harem ‚Äí Episode 9   Mar  8, 06:30 101 comments                 anime    No, the site didn't glitch out on you.

Leadale can't seem to decide if it wants to be a compelling mystery or just a really basic escapist power fantasy                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‚Äí Episode 8   Mar  8, 00:30 19 comments                 anime    I swear, ‚ÄúLet the Chaos Begin‚Äù (the title of episode 8) is exactly what I muttered as I opened the Funimation tab to stream this episode of Tribe Nine, a show full of Danganronpa expy characters that's quickly lost a lot of its flavor.                    ep. review          86 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‚Äí Episode 20   Mar  5, 03:30 86 comments                 anime    There may be more than one person's time being measured by Vanitas' dwindling hourglass, and human or vampire, not every body part can be reattached with some bandages and a sling.                    ep. review          44 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‚Äí Episode 8   Mar  5, 02:30 44 comments                 anime    Arifureta's plot marches forward at breakneck speed...can't things chill a little?                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‚Äí Episode 21   Mar  5, 01:30 107 comments                 anime    Some moments are crucial to understanding a work, and viewers just aren't getting the full Platinum End experience if they don't see Yuri's totally unhinged, unprompted rant about why it's OK for her to not like gay people.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‚Äí Episode 8   Mar  4, 01:30 14 comments                 anime    In the midst of this near-comical deployment of what it thinks commentary is, I'll give Tokyo 24th Ward this: You can tell that this is probably the episode they actually took that extra week off to work on.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‚Äí Episode 8   Mar  3, 01:35 89 comments                 anime    Perhaps the most important thing this episode does is show us that Falanya is far from stupid.
