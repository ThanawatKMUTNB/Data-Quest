My guess is that it is because of her heritage as a Flahm.    Looking at the map (shown in one of the episodes), it's shown Natra is at the top; to the east is the massive Empire and to the south is a mountain range that goes most of the way to the southern coast (making Natra one of the few crossing points for goods to go into and out of the Empire - sorry folks, there is some statecraft/economics in the series, albeit lesser than Realist Hero). Whereas Flahm are not seen badly in Natra or the Empire the way they are seen in the Western countries is beyond racist. In one event likely to be covered in the series, spoiler[Wein is invited by a King to go hunting; and when he finds out that said King was planning on hunting some Flahm and hoped that Wein would allow him to hunt Ninym, he promptly executes him.]   Given the prevailing attitude to the Flahm and Natra's position as essentially a buffer state for the Empire in case of war, Ninym probably considers that her marrying Wein would cause Natra's standing to weaken to a point where the western countries collectively declare war on the kingdom. Hence why, despite her own clear feelings through just two episodes, she rejects Falanya's attempted matchmaking so vehemently.   As for her breasts, I remember her being self-conscious of them in volume 1. It seems to be a running joke that they get larger in the illustrations of each progressive volume?

Best laid plans of mice and men and all that.   But in their attempt to build the tunnel, the miners found a new vein of gold...  Vein, vain? why do I feel Wein should be pronounced as if it was ""Vein""?... so Wein got his money in the end and a new country for ""not"" conquering.   I'm loving this series and its very RTS video game approach to war. ""The Anime Protagonist who was too lazy to fail""; If he spent all his effort into trying to succeed he'd fail but as he's trying to fail then he'll surely succeed? I can accept it.   I was worried that the show would break the fine line between out and out success and outright failure but episode 2 illuminates the path forward: Greater successes yields greater rewards but also greater costs.   An empire built out of ""it seemed like a necessary step at the time"". Like Utawarerumono but with no Godzilla knockoffs.

We don't know that he did nothing for weeks.  Presumably he just kept attacking with varying tactics, but we weren't shown two weeks of his failures, since the episode is only 20 min.  You have to remember that Drawood is 1) full of pride and delusions of superiority, and 2) an idiot who lets that pride rule his actions.  It was a blow to his ego that he was being stymied by such a small force, and that prevented him from using his troops' numbers more to his advantage at least as much as the terrain did (his ""all-out assault"" added ladders and probably other ways for more of his troops to attack at once).  So we also don't know how many of his troops were actively engaged in the all-out assault and how many were left in camp as reinforcements. But that doesn't matter, since Wein & Co. infiltrated in enemy uniforms and were perceived as part of those troops.  In fact if no troops were left in camp, it would've been more suspicious for them to show up.   As to how the camp was attacked previously, well, it was night, they weren't expecting a force of any size to attack so their security was lax, and once it began they were fooled into believing a much larger force was upon them, creating even more panic and chaos.  Plus Drawood seemed to be frozen into inaction by fear and by simply not being used to losing.   None of this is unrealistic.  Wars are lost all the time because of people not behaving with Vulcan logic as you always expect all characters to behave.  Generals can get fooled.  Egos can trump best tactics and thus lead to failure.  Show me a war where woulda, shoulda, coulda didn't come into play at one point or another for at least one side of the conflict.  You're always going to find one moron who wants to attack Russia in winter  (yeah, yeah, I know. It's a meme, don't @ me).

I don't think Drawood thought they could either dig a new tunnel or excavate the collapsed one.  He's a military man, and likely doesn't know from mining or how efficient or not miners could be with that particular geology. Hell, it's not unreasonable to think he forgot they had actual miners on site, being so focused on the troops aspect of the siege.  So his ""months"" to clear could be way off, or clearing a collapsed tunnel may present more difficult problems than digging a new one, or both.

All possible, but then it reduce the tactical part of the show to ""the main character win because he's up against morons"" which I never find really interesting, especially not when they constantly heap praise on the main character for... not being the moron in a room full of moron. It's like watching a race between Usain Bolt and a toddler, no fun.

In the case of the first episode it has almost skipped the part of the imperial ambasador ( in the anime it covers around 1 minute between 2 flashbacks, in the LN is a 25% of the first, a full episode).   in the case of the second is even worse, they skipped spoiler[the full negotitation with a character that is important in the future and the relation between the two factions of marden goverment]   aditionaly in the war they omited some extremely important parts spoiler[ like that all the plans of wein involve both phisical and sicological presure. in the case of the assault they omited the part that 5000 soldiers where at the back of the mountain to look out possible scape routes and the part that the ""discovery"" of the cave was responsability of wein spies so they could make the ambush.   another part that they fully omited is that untill one week after the start of the war the marden soldiers didn't use any siege weapon, and that for the next two weeks they where building them and waiting for getting some from home.   another one is the part with the fires, yes, they added it to the anime, but what they omited is that they did that multiple times and just the  day before the final assault they  burned the supplies of the marden army]   i only hope they slow down the adaptation pace and we dont have anothe seirei gensouki case ( at least with the opening we can see that they only adapted until the third LN, lets see what happens)      Back to top                  Aerodynamic41    Joined: 20 Oct 2015 		    Posts: 131       Posted: Thu Jan 20, 2022 4:40 am              Lirsen wrote:    ( at least with the opening we can see that they only adapted until the third LN, lets see what happens)            I think it's more than 3 volumes.

My guess is that it is because of her heritage as a Flahm.    Looking at the map (shown in one of the episodes), it's shown Natra is at the top; to the east is the massive Empire and to the south is a mountain range that goes most of the way to the southern coast (making Natra one of the few crossing points for goods to go into and out of the Empire - sorry folks, there is some statecraft/economics in the series, albeit lesser than Realist Hero). Whereas Flahm are not seen badly in Natra or the Empire the way they are seen in the Western countries is beyond racist. In one event likely to be covered in the series, spoiler[Wein is invited by a King to go hunting; and when he finds out that said King was planning on hunting some Flahm and hoped that Wein would allow him to hunt Ninym, he promptly executes him.]   Given the prevailing attitude to the Flahm and Natra's position as essentially a buffer state for the Empire in case of war, Ninym probably considers that her marrying Wein would cause Natra's standing to weaken to a point where the western countries collectively declare war on the kingdom. Hence why, despite her own clear feelings through just two episodes, she rejects Falanya's attempted matchmaking so vehemently.   As for her breasts, I remember her being self-conscious of them in volume 1. It seems to be a running joke that they get larger in the illustrations of each progressive volume?

It's like watching a race between Usain Bolt and a toddler, no fun.

In the case of the first episode it has almost skipped the part of the imperial ambasador ( in the anime it covers around 1 minute between 2 flashbacks, in the LN is a 25% of the first, a full episode).   in the case of the second is even worse, they skipped spoiler[the full negotitation with a character that is important in the future and the relation between the two factions of marden goverment]   aditionaly in the war they omited some extremely important parts spoiler[ like that all the plans of wein involve both phisical and sicological presure. in the case of the assault they omited the part that 5000 soldiers where at the back of the mountain to look out possible scape routes and the part that the ""discovery"" of the cave was responsability of wein spies so they could make the ambush.   another part that they fully omited is that untill one week after the start of the war the marden soldiers didn't use any siege weapon, and that for the next two weeks they where building them and waiting for getting some from home.   another one is the part with the fires, yes, they added it to the anime, but what they omited is that they did that multiple times and just the  day before the final assault they  burned the supplies of the marden army]   i only hope they slow down the adaptation pace and we dont have anothe seirei gensouki case ( at least with the opening we can see that they only adapted until the third LN, lets see what happens)      Back to top                  Aerodynamic41    Joined: 20 Oct 2015 		    Posts: 131       Posted: Thu Jan 20, 2022 4:40 am              Lirsen wrote:    ( at least with the opening we can see that they only adapted until the third LN, lets see what happens)            I think it's more than 3 volumes.

I guess it comes from condensing one volume into two episodes but they make it pretty clear they have feelings for each other (especially Ninym) and I half wonder if Wein is trying to sell the kingdom and retire so that he can peacefully marry Ninym without anyone complaining.

I've got a few different ideas for why he is trying to sell out- and none of them have general laziness as the primary motivation. All theory, of course, so I'm quite intrigued about future revelations.

The basic idea was that Wein could use the terrain advantages to nullify the enemy numerical advantages. That's all fine, but why did the enemy general apparently do almost nothing for weeks? When he's eventually defeated he says his army is doing a full assault, why did he wait 3 weeks for this?

The secret tunnel part was also pointlessly roundabout, Wein had a secret tunnel almost fully digged out but not quite finish. He then purposefully collapse another tunnel to take the enemy general mind away from the secret tunnel that general doesn't know exist? How is clearly informing your enemy that you can dig tunnel to the base of the mountain help you keep secret the fact that you can dig tunnel to the base of the mountain? Or are we suppose to think that the general is somehow so incredibly stupid that he doesn't understand that tunnel are man made and new one can therefore be made?

Ninym and Wein's relationship definitely is the most interesting part, so hopefully now that we've established Wein's skills we can get some focus on that.     Quote:     This may be something lost in adaptation but isn't Ninym actually rather busty for a woman her size? I'm not sure why she reacts so negatively to Wein's random sleep talking            She seemed rather modest based on the preceding scene imo. I think the outfit enhances her bust. At best, to me, she presented as average for her size.     meiam wrote:    Episode 1 was fine, but episode 2 felt sloppy.

He had no reason to hold back after the first few attempts failed. One would also presume he had already been trying to throw everything at them from early on as that seemed to be the height of his ""tactics"".

As to how the camp was attacked previously, well, it was night, they weren't expecting a force of any size to attack so their security was lax, and once it began they were fooled into believing a much larger force was upon them, creating even more panic and chaos.  Plus Drawood seemed to be frozen into inaction by fear and by simply not being used to losing.   None of this is unrealistic.  Wars are lost all the time because of people not behaving with Vulcan logic as you always expect all characters to behave.  Generals can get fooled.  Egos can trump best tactics and thus lead to failure.  Show me a war where woulda, shoulda, coulda didn't come into play at one point or another for at least one side of the conflict.  You're always going to find one moron who wants to attack Russia in winter  (yeah, yeah, I know. It's a meme, don't @ me).            All possible, but then it reduce the tactical part of the show to ""the main character win because he's up against morons"" which I never find really interesting, especially not when they constantly heap praise on the main character for... not being the moron in a room full of moron. It's like watching a race between Usain Bolt and a toddler, no fun.

In the case of the first episode it has almost skipped the part of the imperial ambasador ( in the anime it covers around 1 minute between 2 flashbacks, in the LN is a 25% of the first, a full episode).   in the case of the second is even worse, they skipped spoiler[the full negotitation with a character that is important in the future and the relation between the two factions of marden goverment]   aditionaly in the war they omited some extremely important parts spoiler[ like that all the plans of wein involve both phisical and sicological presure. in the case of the assault they omited the part that 5000 soldiers where at the back of the mountain to look out possible scape routes and the part that the ""discovery"" of the cave was responsability of wein spies so they could make the ambush.   another part that they fully omited is that untill one week after the start of the war the marden soldiers didn't use any siege weapon, and that for the next two weeks they where building them and waiting for getting some from home.   another one is the part with the fires, yes, they added it to the anime, but what they omited is that they did that multiple times and just the  day before the final assault they  burned the supplies of the marden army]   i only hope they slow down the adaptation pace and we dont have anothe seirei gensouki case ( at least with the opening we can see that they only adapted until the third LN, lets see what happens)      Back to top                  Aerodynamic41    Joined: 20 Oct 2015 		    Posts: 131       Posted: Thu Jan 20, 2022 4:40 am              Lirsen wrote:    ( at least with the opening we can see that they only adapted until the third LN, lets see what happens)            I think it's more than 3 volumes.

The basic idea was that Wein could use the terrain advantages to nullify the enemy numerical advantages. That's all fine, but why did the enemy general apparently do almost nothing for weeks? When he's eventually defeated he says his army is doing a full assault, why did he wait 3 weeks for this? And if the entire idea is that he can't use his full 30 000 troops to assault the mountain, where were most of his troops on the day of the assault? They can't have been assaulting the fortress since the passage are too narrow for all of them, but at the same time they weren't back in camp, did he just send them to collect flowers? Especially since, just a few days before, his camp was attacked by a small cavalry force, shouldn't he know that his camp was vulnerable to raid (how did that small force even attack his camp in the first place?).    The secret tunnel part was also pointlessly roundabout, Wein had a secret tunnel almost fully digged out but not quite finish. He then purposefully collapse another tunnel to take the enemy general mind away from the secret tunnel that general doesn't know exist? How is clearly informing your enemy that you can dig tunnel to the base of the mountain help you keep secret the fact that you can dig tunnel to the base of the mountain? Or are we suppose to think that the general is somehow so incredibly stupid that he doesn't understand that tunnel are man made and new one can therefore be made?

Ninym and Wein's relationship definitely is the most interesting part, so hopefully now that we've established Wein's skills we can get some focus on that.     Quote:     This may be something lost in adaptation but isn't Ninym actually rather busty for a woman her size? I'm not sure why she reacts so negatively to Wein's random sleep talking            She seemed rather modest based on the preceding scene imo. I think the outfit enhances her bust. At best, to me, she presented as average for her size.     meiam wrote:    Episode 1 was fine, but episode 2 felt sloppy.

He had no reason to hold back after the first few attempts failed. One would also presume he had already been trying to throw everything at them from early on as that seemed to be the height of his ""tactics"".

From what I understood the first tunnel already existed and was on the map, so the collapsed tunnel was to make them think it was closed off. He just didn't think they'd have dug a second parallel tunnel in advance. Though that begs the question of how much time they had to do that if clearing the collapsed tunnel would have taken months.

Apparently the anime's reduced her chest size compared to the Light Novel illustrations (although apparently they got bigger as the series went on).

My guess is that it is because of her heritage as a Flahm.    Looking at the map (shown in one of the episodes), it's shown Natra is at the top; to the east is the massive Empire and to the south is a mountain range that goes most of the way to the southern coast (making Natra one of the few crossing points for goods to go into and out of the Empire - sorry folks, there is some statecraft/economics in the series, albeit lesser than Realist Hero). Whereas Flahm are not seen badly in Natra or the Empire the way they are seen in the Western countries is beyond racist. In one event likely to be covered in the series, spoiler[Wein is invited by a King to go hunting; and when he finds out that said King was planning on hunting some Flahm and hoped that Wein would allow him to hunt Ninym, he promptly executes him.]   Given the prevailing attitude to the Flahm and Natra's position as essentially a buffer state for the Empire in case of war, Ninym probably considers that her marrying Wein would cause Natra's standing to weaken to a point where the western countries collectively declare war on the kingdom. Hence why, despite her own clear feelings through just two episodes, she rejects Falanya's attempted matchmaking so vehemently.   As for her breasts, I remember her being self-conscious of them in volume 1. It seems to be a running joke that they get larger in the illustrations of each progressive volume?

Best laid plans of mice and men and all that.   But in their attempt to build the tunnel, the miners found a new vein of gold...  Vein, vain? why do I feel Wein should be pronounced as if it was ""Vein""?... so Wein got his money in the end and a new country for ""not"" conquering.   I'm loving this series and its very RTS video game approach to war. ""The Anime Protagonist who was too lazy to fail""; If he spent all his effort into trying to succeed he'd fail but as he's trying to fail then he'll surely succeed? I can accept it.   I was worried that the show would break the fine line between out and out success and outright failure but episode 2 illuminates the path forward: Greater successes yields greater rewards but also greater costs.   An empire built out of ""it seemed like a necessary step at the time"". Like Utawarerumono but with no Godzilla knockoffs.

You have to remember that Drawood is 1) full of pride and delusions of superiority, and 2) an idiot who lets that pride rule his actions.  It was a blow to his ego that he was being stymied by such a small force, and that prevented him from using his troops' numbers more to his advantage at least as much as the terrain did (his ""all-out assault"" added ladders and probably other ways for more of his troops to attack at once).  So we also don't know how many of his troops were actively engaged in the all-out assault and how many were left in camp as reinforcements.

I don't think Drawood thought they could either dig a new tunnel or excavate the collapsed one.  He's a military man, and likely doesn't know from mining or how efficient or not miners could be with that particular geology. Hell, it's not unreasonable to think he forgot they had actual miners on site, being so focused on the troops aspect of the siege.  So his ""months"" to clear could be way off, or clearing a collapsed tunnel may present more difficult problems than digging a new one, or both.

The basic idea was that Wein could use the terrain advantages to nullify the enemy numerical advantages. That's all fine, but why did the enemy general apparently do almost nothing for weeks? When he's eventually defeated he says his army is doing a full assault, why did he wait 3 weeks for this? And if the entire idea is that he can't use his full 30 000 troops to assault the mountain, where were most of his troops on the day of the assault? They can't have been assaulting the fortress since the passage are too narrow for all of them, but at the same time they weren't back in camp, did he just send them to collect flowers? Especially since, just a few days before, his camp was attacked by a small cavalry force, shouldn't he know that his camp was vulnerable to raid (how did that small force even attack his camp in the first place?).    The secret tunnel part was also pointlessly roundabout, Wein had a secret tunnel almost fully digged out but not quite finish. He then purposefully collapse another tunnel to take the enemy general mind away from the secret tunnel that general doesn't know exist? How is clearly informing your enemy that you can dig tunnel to the base of the mountain help you keep secret the fact that you can dig tunnel to the base of the mountain? Or are we suppose to think that the general is somehow so incredibly stupid that he doesn't understand that tunnel are man made and new one can therefore be made?

Ninym and Wein's relationship definitely is the most interesting part, so hopefully now that we've established Wein's skills we can get some focus on that.     Quote:     This may be something lost in adaptation but isn't Ninym actually rather busty for a woman her size? I'm not sure why she reacts so negatively to Wein's random sleep talking            She seemed rather modest based on the preceding scene imo. I think the outfit enhances her bust. At best, to me, she presented as average for her size.     meiam wrote:    Episode 1 was fine, but episode 2 felt sloppy.

He had no reason to hold back after the first few attempts failed. One would also presume he had already been trying to throw everything at them from early on as that seemed to be the height of his ""tactics"".

From what I understood the first tunnel already existed and was on the map, so the collapsed tunnel was to make them think it was closed off. He just didn't think they'd have dug a second parallel tunnel in advance. Though that begs the question of how much time they had to do that if clearing the collapsed tunnel would have taken months.

My guess is that it is because of her heritage as a Flahm.    Looking at the map (shown in one of the episodes), it's shown Natra is at the top; to the east is the massive Empire and to the south is a mountain range that goes most of the way to the southern coast (making Natra one of the few crossing points for goods to go into and out of the Empire - sorry folks, there is some statecraft/economics in the series, albeit lesser than Realist Hero). Whereas Flahm are not seen badly in Natra or the Empire the way they are seen in the Western countries is beyond racist. In one event likely to be covered in the series, spoiler[Wein is invited by a King to go hunting; and when he finds out that said King was planning on hunting some Flahm and hoped that Wein would allow him to hunt Ninym, he promptly executes him.]   Given the prevailing attitude to the Flahm and Natra's position as essentially a buffer state for the Empire in case of war, Ninym probably considers that her marrying Wein would cause Natra's standing to weaken to a point where the western countries collectively declare war on the kingdom. Hence why, despite her own clear feelings through just two episodes, she rejects Falanya's attempted matchmaking so vehemently.   As for her breasts, I remember her being self-conscious of them in volume 1. It seems to be a running joke that they get larger in the illustrations of each progressive volume?

Best laid plans of mice and men and all that.   But in their attempt to build the tunnel, the miners found a new vein of gold...  Vein, vain? why do I feel Wein should be pronounced as if it was ""Vein""?... so Wein got his money in the end and a new country for ""not"" conquering.   I'm loving this series and its very RTS video game approach to war. ""The Anime Protagonist who was too lazy to fail""; If he spent all his effort into trying to succeed he'd fail but as he's trying to fail then he'll surely succeed? I can accept it.   I was worried that the show would break the fine line between out and out success and outright failure but episode 2 illuminates the path forward: Greater successes yields greater rewards but also greater costs.   An empire built out of ""it seemed like a necessary step at the time"". Like Utawarerumono but with no Godzilla knockoffs.

You have to remember that Drawood is 1) full of pride and delusions of superiority, and 2) an idiot who lets that pride rule his actions.  It was a blow to his ego that he was being stymied by such a small force, and that prevented him from using his troops' numbers more to his advantage at least as much as the terrain did (his ""all-out assault"" added ladders and probably other ways for more of his troops to attack at once).  So we also don't know how many of his troops were actively engaged in the all-out assault and how many were left in camp as reinforcements. But that doesn't matter, since Wein & Co. infiltrated in enemy uniforms and were perceived as part of those troops.  In fact if no troops were left in camp, it would've been more suspicious for them to show up.   As to how the camp was attacked previously, well, it was night, they weren't expecting a force of any size to attack so their security was lax, and once it began they were fooled into believing a much larger force was upon them, creating even more panic and chaos.  Plus Drawood seemed to be frozen into inaction by fear and by simply not being used to losing.   None of this is unrealistic.  Wars are lost all the time because of people not behaving with Vulcan logic as you always expect all characters to behave.  Generals can get fooled.  Egos can trump best tactics and thus lead to failure.  Show me a war where woulda, shoulda, coulda didn't come into play at one point or another for at least one side of the conflict.

I don't think Drawood thought they could either dig a new tunnel or excavate the collapsed one.  He's a military man, and likely doesn't know from mining or how efficient or not miners could be with that particular geology. Hell, it's not unreasonable to think he forgot they had actual miners on site, being so focused on the troops aspect of the siege.  So his ""months"" to clear could be way off, or clearing a collapsed tunnel may present more difficult problems than digging a new one, or both.

It's like watching a race between Usain Bolt and a toddler, no fun.

News Kounodori: Dr. Stork Manga Returns for New COVID-19 Arc in April (Updated)   posted on 2022-04-02 12:53 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Author also launches new manga about Sakmoto Ryōma in April    Kodansha announced on Saturday that Yū Suzunoki's Kounodori: Dr. Stork (Kōnodori) manga is returning for a new arc that will focus on the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19).    The new arc, titled Kōnodori: Shingata Coronovirus-hen, will launch in Kodansha's Morning magazine on April 28. The manga will again center on Sakura Kōnotori, and will detail the struggles of being an OB/GYN involved in childbirth during the COVID-19 pandemic.    Suzunoki launched the main manga in Kodansha's Morning magazine in August 2012, and the series ended in May 2020. Kodansha published the 32nd and final volume in October 2020.    Kodansha Comics is releasing the manga in English digitally, and it describes the story:   Childbirth isn't an illness, so under normal circumstances, insurance won't cover it. Delivery staff doesn't cure disease or treat injuries, so there's no need for a doctor...unless, of course, circumstances aren't normal. This smash-hit drama gives a look into the lives of the men and women who work to welcome 1,000,000 new lives into the world each year in Japan.   The manga inspired a live-action television series in October 2015, and a sequel series premiered in October 2017.

News Kounodori: Dr. Stork Manga Returns for New COVID-19 Arc in April (Updated)   posted on 2022-04-02 12:53 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Author also launches new manga about Sakmoto Ryōma in April    Kodansha announced on Saturday that Yū Suzunoki's Kounodori: Dr. Stork (Kōnodori) manga is returning for a new arc that will focus on the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19).    The new arc, titled Kōnodori: Shingata Coronovirus-hen, will launch in Kodansha's Morning magazine on April 28. The manga will again center on Sakura Kōnotori, and will detail the struggles of being an OB/GYN involved in childbirth during the COVID-19 pandemic.    Suzunoki launched the main manga in Kodansha's Morning magazine in August 2012, and the series ended in May 2020. Kodansha published the 32nd and final volume in October 2020.    Kodansha Comics is releasing the manga in English digitally, and it describes the story:   Childbirth isn't an illness, so under normal circumstances, insurance won't cover it. Delivery staff doesn't cure disease or treat injuries, so there's no need for a doctor...unless, of course, circumstances aren't normal. This smash-hit drama gives a look into the lives of the men and women who work to welcome 1,000,000 new lives into the world each year in Japan.   The manga inspired a live-action television series in October 2015, and a sequel series premiered in October 2017.   Update: Suzunoki will also launch a new manga titled Ryōma ga Yuku based on Ryōtarō's historical novel starting in Bungeishunju's Weekly Bunshun magazine on April 28. The manga tells a fictional story about the historical figure Sakamoto Ryōma.

News Kounodori: Dr. Stork Manga Returns for New COVID-19 Arc in April (Updated)   posted on 2022-04-02 12:53 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Author also launches new manga about Sakmoto Ryōma in April    Kodansha announced on Saturday that Yū Suzunoki's Kounodori: Dr. Stork (Kōnodori) manga is returning for a new arc that will focus on the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19).    The new arc, titled Kōnodori: Shingata Coronovirus-hen, will launch in Kodansha's Morning magazine on April 28. The manga will again center on Sakura Kōnotori, and will detail the struggles of being an OB/GYN involved in childbirth during the COVID-19 pandemic.    Suzunoki launched the main manga in Kodansha's Morning magazine in August 2012, and the series ended in May 2020. Kodansha published the 32nd and final volume in October 2020.    Kodansha Comics is releasing the manga in English digitally, and it describes the story:   Childbirth isn't an illness, so under normal circumstances, insurance won't cover it. Delivery staff doesn't cure disease or treat injuries, so there's no need for a doctor...unless, of course, circumstances aren't normal. This smash-hit drama gives a look into the lives of the men and women who work to welcome 1,000,000 new lives into the world each year in Japan.   The manga inspired a live-action television series in October 2015, and a sequel series premiered in October 2017.   Update: Suzunoki will also launch a new manga titled Ryōma ga Yuku based on Ryōtarō's historical novel starting in Bungeishunju's Weekly Bunshun magazine on April 28. The manga tells a fictional story about the historical figure Sakamoto Ryōma.

News Kounodori: Dr. Stork Manga Returns for New COVID-19 Arc in April (Updated)   posted on 2022-04-02 12:53 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Author also launches new manga about Sakmoto Ryōma in April    Kodansha announced on Saturday that Yū Suzunoki's Kounodori: Dr. Stork (Kōnodori) manga is returning for a new arc that will focus on the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19).    The new arc, titled Kōnodori: Shingata Coronovirus-hen, will launch in Kodansha's Morning magazine on April 28. The manga will again center on Sakura Kōnotori, and will detail the struggles of being an OB/GYN involved in childbirth during the COVID-19 pandemic.    Suzunoki launched the main manga in Kodansha's Morning magazine in August 2012, and the series ended in May 2020. Kodansha published the 32nd and final volume in October 2020.    Kodansha Comics is releasing the manga in English digitally, and it describes the story:   Childbirth isn't an illness, so under normal circumstances, insurance won't cover it. Delivery staff doesn't cure disease or treat injuries, so there's no need for a doctor...unless, of course, circumstances aren't normal. This smash-hit drama gives a look into the lives of the men and women who work to welcome 1,000,000 new lives into the world each year in Japan.   The manga inspired a live-action television series in October 2015, and a sequel series premiered in October 2017.   Update: Suzunoki will also launch a new manga titled Ryōma ga Yuku based on Ryōtarō's historical novel starting in Bungeishunju's Weekly Bunshun magazine on April 28. The manga tells a fictional story about the historical figure Sakamoto Ryōma.

Interest Demon Slayer Voice Actors Perform Live Commentary On Entertainment District Arc Highlights   posted on 2022-04-01 08:45 UTC-8 by Ken Iikura-Gross         AnimeJapan 2022 was one of their first opportunities to speak about their experiences and memories of the season     With Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba's latest season Entertainment District Arc wrapped up, AnimeJapan 2022 was one of the first opportunities for the voice cast to speak about their experiences and memories of the season with a surprise live commentary show.    Featuring Natsuki Hanae (Tanjiro Kamado), Akari Kitō (Nezuko Kamado), Hiro Shimono (Zenitsu Agatsuma), Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Inosuke Hashibira), and Katsuyuki Konishi (Tengen Uzui), the five voice actors greeted an enthusiastic crowd, saying they were excited to be with a live audience after a couple of years of only being able to engage in livesteam events. Of course they were also happy that people could join via the official livestream.    While it seemed the voice actors and the audience were ready for a 30 minute talk show, the MC, and producer of Demon Slayer, Yūma Takahashi, threw a nice little curve ball to everyone: a live audio commentary for select sections of the Entertainment District Arc. But this was no short commentary; it was 18 minutes long—nearly a full episode of Demon Slayer. The voice cast was certainly surprised at the length, and Shimono and Hanae drove it home with a little jovial banter reinforcing this was really going to be a full commentary.     To kick things off, the audience was treated to a nice three shot of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke in their courtesan in training disguise and a discussion about the three characters' infiltration into the entertainment district. Shimono had quite a bit to say, as he was most excited to voice this section of the story. Most especially about Zenko's (Zenitsu's front for the mission) heavy makeup worn throughout the season. “It may have been heavy makeup, but it didn't make me look that ugly.” Shimono remarked. Yet, he also noted the beautiful and fluid animation made him forget about the makeup when watching the show. This was all topped off with some nice ribbing and jokes from Matsuoka about Inosuke not speaking, beginning with Matsuoka putting on a feminine voice and ending with the deep voice he used when Inosuke apologized to Tanjiro and Zenitsu at the end of the Tanjiro Kamado, Unwavering Resolve Arc of Demon Slayer.    The live commentary moved on the most exciting part of Demon Slayer's Entertainment District Arc, the action packed fights, with an engaging conversation about the demon's Daki and Gyutarō. Both Hanae and Kitō said they were a bit intimidated by Daki's voice actor, Miyuki Sawashiro, in a good way as they could feel the intensity in her performance. Konishi was also surprised at the choice of Gyutarō's voice actor, Ryōta Ōsaka, at first. Wondering if Ōsaka has ever done roles like Gyutarō in the past, after listening to him Konishi thought, “That's Gyutarō.” It was unfortunate Sawashiro and Ōsaka couldn't join the 5 on stage at AnimeJapan 2022, but it was evident the respect the Hanae, Kitō, and Konishi had for the two.     There was also a general consensus among the voice actors about the action in the Entertainment District Arc of Demon Slayer with Hanae and Konishi saying they both had scenes they watched several times for how well everything came together. Konishi pointed his recording session of Tengen's final throw down with Gyutarō saying, “The art was nearly complete—still in black and white and a bit rough—and looked amazing. You could use it as is, but when it was completed it was even better.” In fact, Konishi got goose bumps watching it, and it was his first time in a while crying from watching a scene that wasn't a tearjerker.    However, the most moving sections of the live commentary were when the cast touched on the main theme of Demon Slayer: family. This wasn't just the family bond between Tanjiro and Nezuko, but also between Daki and Gyutarō. With the former, the audience was treated to the beautiful scene in the sixth episode where Tanjiro had to calm Nezuko with a lullaby. Hanae noted this was actually the first thing he voiced for the season. But then he joked that since Tanjiro is supposed to be tone deaf Nezuko's tears might not have been from her memories but because he's a bad singer. Kitō laughed along with Hanae's comments.     However, it was surprising to hear Kitō talk about the demons, Daki and Gyutarō, and their relationship with each other. Since they are the featured demons for the Entertainment District Arc, the audience is not supposed to feel much sympathy for them. Kitō made light of this, but when shown one of the final scenes from the tenth episode she pointed out she couldn't really be mad at Daki. Kitō even went on to mention that she is like a cute brat and Gyutarō really cares for her. This was a nice reminder that despite the abhorrent nature of the demons in Demon Slayer, those same demons can have the same familial connections as the humans.    It's not often you get to see cast member of an anime series do a live commentary. This made the Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba stage event at AnimeJapan 2022 feel special for those who could attend in-person and watch via stream.        discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Interest Demon Slayer Voice Actors Perform Live Commentary On Entertainment District Arc Highlights   posted on 2022-04-01 08:45 UTC-8 by Ken Iikura-Gross         AnimeJapan 2022 was one of their first opportunities to speak about their experiences and memories of the season     With Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba's latest season Entertainment District Arc wrapped up, AnimeJapan 2022 was one of the first opportunities for the voice cast to speak about their experiences and memories of the season with a surprise live commentary show.    Featuring Natsuki Hanae (Tanjiro Kamado), Akari Kitō (Nezuko Kamado), Hiro Shimono (Zenitsu Agatsuma), Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Inosuke Hashibira), and Katsuyuki Konishi (Tengen Uzui), the five voice actors greeted an enthusiastic crowd, saying they were excited to be with a live audience after a couple of years of only being able to engage in livesteam events. Of course they were also happy that people could join via the official livestream.    While it seemed the voice actors and the audience were ready for a 30 minute talk show, the MC, and producer of Demon Slayer, Yūma Takahashi, threw a nice little curve ball to everyone: a live audio commentary for select sections of the Entertainment District Arc. But this was no short commentary; it was 18 minutes long—nearly a full episode of Demon Slayer. The voice cast was certainly surprised at the length, and Shimono and Hanae drove it home with a little jovial banter reinforcing this was really going to be a full commentary.     To kick things off, the audience was treated to a nice three shot of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke in their courtesan in training disguise and a discussion about the three characters' infiltration into the entertainment district. Shimono had quite a bit to say, as he was most excited to voice this section of the story. Most especially about Zenko's (Zenitsu's front for the mission) heavy makeup worn throughout the season. “It may have been heavy makeup, but it didn't make me look that ugly.” Shimono remarked. Yet, he also noted the beautiful and fluid animation made him forget about the makeup when watching the show. This was all topped off with some nice ribbing and jokes from Matsuoka about Inosuke not speaking, beginning with Matsuoka putting on a feminine voice and ending with the deep voice he used when Inosuke apologized to Tanjiro and Zenitsu at the end of the Tanjiro Kamado, Unwavering Resolve Arc of Demon Slayer.    The live commentary moved on the most exciting part of Demon Slayer's Entertainment District Arc, the action packed fights, with an engaging conversation about the demon's Daki and Gyutarō. Both Hanae and Kitō said they were a bit intimidated by Daki's voice actor, Miyuki Sawashiro, in a good way as they could feel the intensity in her performance. Konishi was also surprised at the choice of Gyutarō's voice actor, Ryōta Ōsaka, at first. Wondering if Ōsaka has ever done roles like Gyutarō in the past, after listening to him Konishi thought, “That's Gyutarō.” It was unfortunate Sawashiro and Ōsaka couldn't join the 5 on stage at AnimeJapan 2022, but it was evident the respect the Hanae, Kitō, and Konishi had for the two.     There was also a general consensus among the voice actors about the action in the Entertainment District Arc of Demon Slayer with Hanae and Konishi saying they both had scenes they watched several times for how well everything came together. Konishi pointed his recording session of Tengen's final throw down with Gyutarō saying, “The art was nearly complete—still in black and white and a bit rough—and looked amazing. You could use it as is, but when it was completed it was even better.” In fact, Konishi got goose bumps watching it, and it was his first time in a while crying from watching a scene that wasn't a tearjerker.    However, the most moving sections of the live commentary were when the cast touched on the main theme of Demon Slayer: family. This wasn't just the family bond between Tanjiro and Nezuko, but also between Daki and Gyutarō. With the former, the audience was treated to the beautiful scene in the sixth episode where Tanjiro had to calm Nezuko with a lullaby. Hanae noted this was actually the first thing he voiced for the season. But then he joked that since Tanjiro is supposed to be tone deaf Nezuko's tears might not have been from her memories but because he's a bad singer. Kitō laughed along with Hanae's comments.     However, it was surprising to hear Kitō talk about the demons, Daki and Gyutarō, and their relationship with each other. Since they are the featured demons for the Entertainment District Arc, the audience is not supposed to feel much sympathy for them. Kitō made light of this, but when shown one of the final scenes from the tenth episode she pointed out she couldn't really be mad at Daki. Kitō even went on to mention that she is like a cute brat and Gyutarō really cares for her. This was a nice reminder that despite the abhorrent nature of the demons in Demon Slayer, those same demons can have the same familial connections as the humans.    It's not often you get to see cast member of an anime series do a live commentary. This made the Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba stage event at AnimeJapan 2022 feel special for those who could attend in-person and watch via stream.        discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Interest Demon Slayer Voice Actors Perform Live Commentary On Entertainment District Arc Highlights   posted on 2022-04-01 08:45 UTC-8 by Ken Iikura-Gross         AnimeJapan 2022 was one of their first opportunities to speak about their experiences and memories of the season     With Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba's latest season Entertainment District Arc wrapped up, AnimeJapan 2022 was one of the first opportunities for the voice cast to speak about their experiences and memories of the season with a surprise live commentary show.    Featuring Natsuki Hanae (Tanjiro Kamado), Akari Kitō (Nezuko Kamado), Hiro Shimono (Zenitsu Agatsuma), Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Inosuke Hashibira), and Katsuyuki Konishi (Tengen Uzui), the five voice actors greeted an enthusiastic crowd, saying they were excited to be with a live audience after a couple of years of only being able to engage in livesteam events. Of course they were also happy that people could join via the official livestream.    While it seemed the voice actors and the audience were ready for a 30 minute talk show, the MC, and producer of Demon Slayer, Yūma Takahashi, threw a nice little curve ball to everyone: a live audio commentary for select sections of the Entertainment District Arc. But this was no short commentary; it was 18 minutes long—nearly a full episode of Demon Slayer. The voice cast was certainly surprised at the length, and Shimono and Hanae drove it home with a little jovial banter reinforcing this was really going to be a full commentary.     To kick things off, the audience was treated to a nice three shot of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke in their courtesan in training disguise and a discussion about the three characters' infiltration into the entertainment district. Shimono had quite a bit to say, as he was most excited to voice this section of the story. Most especially about Zenko's (Zenitsu's front for the mission) heavy makeup worn throughout the season. “It may have been heavy makeup, but it didn't make me look that ugly.” Shimono remarked. Yet, he also noted the beautiful and fluid animation made him forget about the makeup when watching the show. This was all topped off with some nice ribbing and jokes from Matsuoka about Inosuke not speaking, beginning with Matsuoka putting on a feminine voice and ending with the deep voice he used when Inosuke apologized to Tanjiro and Zenitsu at the end of the Tanjiro Kamado, Unwavering Resolve Arc of Demon Slayer.    The live commentary moved on the most exciting part of Demon Slayer's Entertainment District Arc, the action packed fights, with an engaging conversation about the demon's Daki and Gyutarō. Both Hanae and Kitō said they were a bit intimidated by Daki's voice actor, Miyuki Sawashiro, in a good way as they could feel the intensity in her performance. Konishi was also surprised at the choice of Gyutarō's voice actor, Ryōta Ōsaka, at first. Wondering if Ōsaka has ever done roles like Gyutarō in the past, after listening to him Konishi thought, “That's Gyutarō.” It was unfortunate Sawashiro and Ōsaka couldn't join the 5 on stage at AnimeJapan 2022, but it was evident the respect the Hanae, Kitō, and Konishi had for the two.     There was also a general consensus among the voice actors about the action in the Entertainment District Arc of Demon Slayer with Hanae and Konishi saying they both had scenes they watched several times for how well everything came together. Konishi pointed his recording session of Tengen's final throw down with Gyutarō saying, “The art was nearly complete—still in black and white and a bit rough—and looked amazing. You could use it as is, but when it was completed it was even better.” In fact, Konishi got goose bumps watching it, and it was his first time in a while crying from watching a scene that wasn't a tearjerker.    However, the most moving sections of the live commentary were when the cast touched on the main theme of Demon Slayer: family. This wasn't just the family bond between Tanjiro and Nezuko, but also between Daki and Gyutarō. With the former, the audience was treated to the beautiful scene in the sixth episode where Tanjiro had to calm Nezuko with a lullaby. Hanae noted this was actually the first thing he voiced for the season. But then he joked that since Tanjiro is supposed to be tone deaf Nezuko's tears might not have been from her memories but because he's a bad singer. Kitō laughed along with Hanae's comments.     However, it was surprising to hear Kitō talk about the demons, Daki and Gyutarō, and their relationship with each other. Since they are the featured demons for the Entertainment District Arc, the audience is not supposed to feel much sympathy for them. Kitō made light of this, but when shown one of the final scenes from the tenth episode she pointed out she couldn't really be mad at Daki. Kitō even went on to mention that she is like a cute brat and Gyutarō really cares for her. This was a nice reminder that despite the abhorrent nature of the demons in Demon Slayer, those same demons can have the same familial connections as the humans.    It's not often you get to see cast member of an anime series do a live commentary. This made the Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba stage event at AnimeJapan 2022 feel special for those who could attend in-person and watch via stream.        discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Interest Demon Slayer Voice Actors Perform Live Commentary On Entertainment District Arc Highlights   posted on 2022-04-01 08:45 UTC-8 by Ken Iikura-Gross         AnimeJapan 2022 was one of their first opportunities to speak about their experiences and memories of the season     With Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba's latest season Entertainment District Arc wrapped up, AnimeJapan 2022 was one of the first opportunities for the voice cast to speak about their experiences and memories of the season with a surprise live commentary show.    Featuring Natsuki Hanae (Tanjiro Kamado), Akari Kitō (Nezuko Kamado), Hiro Shimono (Zenitsu Agatsuma), Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Inosuke Hashibira), and Katsuyuki Konishi (Tengen Uzui), the five voice actors greeted an enthusiastic crowd, saying they were excited to be with a live audience after a couple of years of only being able to engage in livesteam events. Of course they were also happy that people could join via the official livestream.    While it seemed the voice actors and the audience were ready for a 30 minute talk show, the MC, and producer of Demon Slayer, Yūma Takahashi, threw a nice little curve ball to everyone: a live audio commentary for select sections of the Entertainment District Arc. But this was no short commentary; it was 18 minutes long—nearly a full episode of Demon Slayer. The voice cast was certainly surprised at the length, and Shimono and Hanae drove it home with a little jovial banter reinforcing this was really going to be a full commentary.     To kick things off, the audience was treated to a nice three shot of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke in their courtesan in training disguise and a discussion about the three characters' infiltration into the entertainment district.

Both Hanae and Kitō said they were a bit intimidated by Daki's voice actor, Miyuki Sawashiro, in a good way as they could feel the intensity in her performance. Konishi was also surprised at the choice of Gyutarō's voice actor, Ryōta Ōsaka, at first.

Interest Demon Slayer Voice Actors Perform Live Commentary On Entertainment District Arc Highlights   posted on 2022-04-01 08:45 UTC-8 by Ken Iikura-Gross         AnimeJapan 2022 was one of their first opportunities to speak about their experiences and memories of the season     With Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba's latest season Entertainment District Arc wrapped up, AnimeJapan 2022 was one of the first opportunities for the voice cast to speak about their experiences and memories of the season with a surprise live commentary show.    Featuring Natsuki Hanae (Tanjiro Kamado), Akari Kitō (Nezuko Kamado), Hiro Shimono (Zenitsu Agatsuma), Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Inosuke Hashibira), and Katsuyuki Konishi (Tengen Uzui), the five voice actors greeted an enthusiastic crowd, saying they were excited to be with a live audience after a couple of years of only being able to engage in livesteam events. Of course they were also happy that people could join via the official livestream.    While it seemed the voice actors and the audience were ready for a 30 minute talk show, the MC, and producer of Demon Slayer, Yūma Takahashi, threw a nice little curve ball to everyone: a live audio commentary for select sections of the Entertainment District Arc. But this was no short commentary; it was 18 minutes long—nearly a full episode of Demon Slayer. The voice cast was certainly surprised at the length, and Shimono and Hanae drove it home with a little jovial banter reinforcing this was really going to be a full commentary.     To kick things off, the audience was treated to a nice three shot of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke in their courtesan in training disguise and a discussion about the three characters' infiltration into the entertainment district. Shimono had quite a bit to say, as he was most excited to voice this section of the story. Most especially about Zenko's (Zenitsu's front for the mission) heavy makeup worn throughout the season. “It may have been heavy makeup, but it didn't make me look that ugly.” Shimono remarked. Yet, he also noted the beautiful and fluid animation made him forget about the makeup when watching the show. This was all topped off with some nice ribbing and jokes from Matsuoka about Inosuke not speaking, beginning with Matsuoka putting on a feminine voice and ending with the deep voice he used when Inosuke apologized to Tanjiro and Zenitsu at the end of the Tanjiro Kamado, Unwavering Resolve Arc of Demon Slayer.    The live commentary moved on the most exciting part of Demon Slayer's Entertainment District Arc, the action packed fights, with an engaging conversation about the demon's Daki and Gyutarō. Both Hanae and Kitō said they were a bit intimidated by Daki's voice actor, Miyuki Sawashiro, in a good way as they could feel the intensity in her performance. Konishi was also surprised at the choice of Gyutarō's voice actor, Ryōta Ōsaka, at first. Wondering if Ōsaka has ever done roles like Gyutarō in the past, after listening to him Konishi thought, “That's Gyutarō.” It was unfortunate Sawashiro and Ōsaka couldn't join the 5 on stage at AnimeJapan 2022, but it was evident the respect the Hanae, Kitō, and Konishi had for the two.     There was also a general consensus among the voice actors about the action in the Entertainment District Arc of Demon Slayer with Hanae and Konishi saying they both had scenes they watched several times for how well everything came together. Konishi pointed his recording session of Tengen's final throw down with Gyutarō saying, “The art was nearly complete—still in black and white and a bit rough—and looked amazing. You could use it as is, but when it was completed it was even better.” In fact, Konishi got goose bumps watching it, and it was his first time in a while crying from watching a scene that wasn't a tearjerker.    However, the most moving sections of the live commentary were when the cast touched on the main theme of Demon Slayer: family. This wasn't just the family bond between Tanjiro and Nezuko, but also between Daki and Gyutarō. With the former, the audience was treated to the beautiful scene in the sixth episode where Tanjiro had to calm Nezuko with a lullaby. Hanae noted this was actually the first thing he voiced for the season. But then he joked that since Tanjiro is supposed to be tone deaf Nezuko's tears might not have been from her memories but because he's a bad singer. Kitō laughed along with Hanae's comments.     However, it was surprising to hear Kitō talk about the demons, Daki and Gyutarō, and their relationship with each other. Since they are the featured demons for the Entertainment District Arc, the audience is not supposed to feel much sympathy for them. Kitō made light of this, but when shown one of the final scenes from the tenth episode she pointed out she couldn't really be mad at Daki. Kitō even went on to mention that she is like a cute brat and Gyutarō really cares for her. This was a nice reminder that despite the abhorrent nature of the demons in Demon Slayer, those same demons can have the same familial connections as the humans.    It's not often you get to see cast member of an anime series do a live commentary. This made the Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba stage event at AnimeJapan 2022 feel special for those who could attend in-person and watch via stream.        discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

Kitō made light of this, but when shown one of the final scenes from the tenth episode she pointed out she couldn't really be mad at Daki. Kitō even went on to mention that she is like a cute brat and Gyutarō really cares for her. This was a nice reminder that despite the abhorrent nature of the demons in Demon Slayer, those same demons can have the same familial connections as the humans.

Featuring Natsuki Hanae (Tanjiro Kamado), Akari Kitō (Nezuko Kamado), Hiro Shimono (Zenitsu Agatsuma), Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Inosuke Hashibira), and Katsuyuki Konishi (Tengen Uzui), the five voice actors greeted an enthusiastic crowd, saying they were excited to be with a live audience after a couple of years of only being able to engage in livesteam events. Of course they were also happy that people could join via the official livestream.    While it seemed the voice actors and the audience were ready for a 30 minute talk show, the MC, and producer of Demon Slayer, Yūma Takahashi, threw a nice little curve ball to everyone: a live audio commentary for select sections of the Entertainment District Arc. But this was no short commentary; it was 18 minutes long—nearly a full episode of Demon Slayer. The voice cast was certainly surprised at the length, and Shimono and Hanae drove it home with a little jovial banter reinforcing this was really going to be a full commentary.     To kick things off, the audience was treated to a nice three shot of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke in their courtesan in training disguise and a discussion about the three characters' infiltration into the entertainment district. Shimono had quite a bit to say, as he was most excited to voice this section of the story. Most especially about Zenko's (Zenitsu's front for the mission) heavy makeup worn throughout the season. “It may have been heavy makeup, but it didn't make me look that ugly.” Shimono remarked. Yet, he also noted the beautiful and fluid animation made him forget about the makeup when watching the show. This was all topped off with some nice ribbing and jokes from Matsuoka about Inosuke not speaking, beginning with Matsuoka putting on a feminine voice and ending with the deep voice he used when Inosuke apologized to Tanjiro and Zenitsu at the end of the Tanjiro Kamado, Unwavering Resolve Arc of Demon Slayer.    The live commentary moved on the most exciting part of Demon Slayer's Entertainment District Arc, the action packed fights, with an engaging conversation about the demon's Daki and Gyutarō. Both Hanae and Kitō said they were a bit intimidated by Daki's voice actor, Miyuki Sawashiro, in a good way as they could feel the intensity in her performance. Konishi was also surprised at the choice of Gyutarō's voice actor, Ryōta Ōsaka, at first. Wondering if Ōsaka has ever done roles like Gyutarō in the past, after listening to him Konishi thought, “That's Gyutarō.” It was unfortunate Sawashiro and Ōsaka couldn't join the 5 on stage at AnimeJapan 2022, but it was evident the respect the Hanae, Kitō, and Konishi had for the two.     There was also a general consensus among the voice actors about the action in the Entertainment District Arc of Demon Slayer with Hanae and Konishi saying they both had scenes they watched several times for how well everything came together. Konishi pointed his recording session of Tengen's final throw down with Gyutarō saying, “The art was nearly complete—still in black and white and a bit rough—and looked amazing. You could use it as is, but when it was completed it was even better.” In fact, Konishi got goose bumps watching it, and it was his first time in a while crying from watching a scene that wasn't a tearjerker.    However, the most moving sections of the live commentary were when the cast touched on the main theme of Demon Slayer: family. This wasn't just the family bond between Tanjiro and Nezuko, but also between Daki and Gyutarō. With the former, the audience was treated to the beautiful scene in the sixth episode where Tanjiro had to calm Nezuko with a lullaby. Hanae noted this was actually the first thing he voiced for the season. But then he joked that since Tanjiro is supposed to be tone deaf Nezuko's tears might not have been from her memories but because he's a bad singer. Kitō laughed along with Hanae's comments.

Interest Today on Wikipedia: Did You Know That a Common Way to Travel to Another World Is to Be Hit by a Truck?   posted on 2022-04-01 16:00 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Wikipedia's main page links to ""Isekai"", ""Truck-kun"" pages for April Fool's    It's April Fool's Day, and Wikipedia is joining in on the fun by listing goofy facts on its main page. Today's ""Did You Know"" section (screenshotted here) contains a cheeky reference to the isekai fantasy genre: ""Did you know that a common way to travel to another world is to be hit by a truck?"" The links take you to the Isekai and Truck-kun pages on Wikipedia.    The reference is to a common reincarnation trope in isekai fantasy series, where ""traffic accident by truck"" is one of the leading causes of known deaths among protagonists. Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation popularized the trope in 2012. Other series that feature or parody the killer truck include: KONOSUBA, Zombie Land Saga, Didn't I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life?!, and Wise Man's Grandchild.

Interest Today on Wikipedia: Did You Know That a Common Way to Travel to Another World Is to Be Hit by a Truck?   posted on 2022-04-01 16:00 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Wikipedia's main page links to ""Isekai"", ""Truck-kun"" pages for April Fool's    It's April Fool's Day, and Wikipedia is joining in on the fun by listing goofy facts on its main page. Today's ""Did You Know"" section (screenshotted here) contains a cheeky reference to the isekai fantasy genre: ""Did you know that a common way to travel to another world is to be hit by a truck?"" The links take you to the Isekai and Truck-kun pages on Wikipedia.    The reference is to a common reincarnation trope in isekai fantasy series, where ""traffic accident by truck"" is one of the leading causes of known deaths among protagonists. Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation popularized the trope in 2012. Other series that feature or parody the killer truck include: KONOSUBA, Zombie Land Saga, Didn't I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life?!, and Wise Man's Grandchild.

I hope they fundraise through phantom badge sales or do a limited online event. The AC Convention Center is not solid on accessibility, and the idea that an event *may not*enforce their own policies goes against all sense and sensibility.

They get a price hike because they weren't there for two years?  Gee, I wonder why they wouldn't have held a convention there those years?  No cooperation on safety measures.  And another event happening nearby is just a pain.  I've been to conventions where another big event was in town for part of it, and it sucked, aside from the food trucks that showed up for the day of overlap.     It sounds like they ended up with not a lot of cooperation in exchange for those contractual obligations, so using it for staff time was the way to go.

Sounds like it might be time to find another venue,  if that is even an option.

It's less. I am assuming the page originally had more information than they were either allowed to disclose or that the site would rather not have them disclose. It might be a little of both since lawyers are involved.

Really sucks that this is an issue and they're having issues with them.   Somerset will always be my favorite venue of theirs, AC venue much less so due to many reasons. But hopefully they can find an awesome home for next year and onwards!

I'd been going to AnimeNEXT for years, I first went to AnimeNEXT when at it's previous location in Sommerset but stopped because it was far from where I was living at the time and the con wasn't well organized, but once I went to college in Philly it was a no brainer.

I hope they fundraise through phantom badge sales or do a limited online event. The AC Convention Center is not solid on accessibility, and the idea that an event *may not*enforce their own policies goes against all sense and sensibility.

They get a price hike because they weren't there for two years?  Gee, I wonder why they wouldn't have held a convention there those years?  No cooperation on safety measures.  And another event happening nearby is just a pain.  I've been to conventions where another big event was in town for part of it, and it sucked, aside from the food trucks that showed up for the day of overlap.     It sounds like they ended up with not a lot of cooperation in exchange for those contractual obligations, so using it for staff time was the way to go.

Sounds like it might be time to find another venue,  if that is even an option.

It's less. I am assuming the page originally had more information than they were either allowed to disclose or that the site would rather not have them disclose. It might be a little of both since lawyers are involved.

Really sucks that this is an issue and they're having issues with them.   Somerset will always be my favorite venue of theirs, AC venue much less so due to many reasons. But hopefully they can find an awesome home for next year and onwards!

I'd been going to AnimeNEXT for years, I first went to AnimeNEXT when at it's previous location in Sommerset but stopped because it was far from where I was living at the time and the con wasn't well organized, but once I went to college in Philly it was a no brainer.

They get a price hike because they weren't there for two years?  Gee, I wonder why they wouldn't have held a convention there those years?  No cooperation on safety measures.  And another event happening nearby is just a pain.  I've been to conventions where another big event was in town for part of it, and it sucked, aside from the food trucks that showed up for the day of overlap.     It sounds like they ended up with not a lot of cooperation in exchange for those contractual obligations, so using it for staff time was the way to go.

I'd been going to AnimeNEXT for years, I first went to AnimeNEXT when at it's previous location in Sommerset but stopped because it was far from where I was living at the time and the con wasn't well organized, but once I went to college in Philly it was a no brainer.
