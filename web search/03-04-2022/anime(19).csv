It's been a shell of its former self for a long time, getting less relevant year after year even before the big issues happened and with all these replacements -- like Summer Games Fest, Nintendo Directs, State of Play, etc. -- out there I really don't see it come back from a multi-year hiatus in any way that truly matters.   The name still turns heads, sure. It used to be like a second Christmas in the middle of the year. And even when it wasn't, it at least was a kind of amazing shitshow that was a must-watch just for a bit of second-hand-embarrassment and a laugh. But it's not either of those things anymore. I just doesn't mean much anymore.   MAYBE in the future, once they can do a big in-person event again without many major restrictions, it matters again but even that is a big maybe.

Considering Sony wasn't even part of E3 for the last two years, it's hard to think that there were any plans to begin with.

I don't even think any of the Big 3 have been to E3 the last couple times they've had it anyway. Sony pulled out years ago and just settled for their own thing (forget the name of their event in Nov/Dec), Xbox half pulled out where they kinda show up, but then show off a bunch of stuff outside the event. And Nintendo has been sort of picking and choosing which ones to attend and which to skip, like Sony also focusing more on their own exclusive event. I don't think any of the current generation of consoles were even announced at E3 as had been the custom.   The days of the ""old"" E3 have been gone for some time now. If it survives at all, it will likely be mostly with indie developers and have more of a ""Comicon/Comiket for mostly video games"" sort of feel to it I imagine. They'll have to reinvent what the event means and how it looks, maybe tie-in and push some major esports tournament, because I don't foresee the Big 3 being major players ever again.

Now everything is up in the air. The Big 3 just up and announce dates of streams randomly. I guess the companies are happy to have that freedom and developers are forced to crunch to have something ready to show. But the lack of it does kill enthusiasm for their products. The hype-cycle did serve a purpose in that regard.   Things like Nintendo Directs and State of Plays and whatever Microsoft calls theirs just don't command the attention they used to.   At least the Game Awards guarantees reveals and announcements, but you then have to sit through a bunch of other stuff you don't care about too, and those only interested in announcements from their preferred publishers and 1st parties are never guaranteed to see them there unlike dedicated events.   My enthusiasm for next-gen is in the negatives. The only 'holy-shit' moment of next-gen-ness for me was that playable Matrix UnReal demo. Call me when there are more games that match that kind of promise.

It's been a shell of its former self for a long time, getting less relevant year after year even before the big issues happened and with all these replacements -- like Summer Games Fest, Nintendo Directs, State of Play, etc. -- out there I really don't see it come back from a multi-year hiatus in any way that truly matters.   The name still turns heads, sure. It used to be like a second Christmas in the middle of the year. And even when it wasn't, it at least was a kind of amazing shitshow that was a must-watch just for a bit of second-hand-embarrassment and a laugh. But it's not either of those things anymore. I just doesn't mean much anymore.   MAYBE in the future, once they can do a big in-person event again without many major restrictions, it matters again but even that is a big maybe.

Considering Sony wasn't even part of E3 for the last two years, it's hard to think that there were any plans to begin with.

I don't even think any of the Big 3 have been to E3 the last couple times they've had it anyway. Sony pulled out years ago and just settled for their own thing (forget the name of their event in Nov/Dec), Xbox half pulled out where they kinda show up, but then show off a bunch of stuff outside the event. And Nintendo has been sort of picking and choosing which ones to attend and which to skip, like Sony also focusing more on their own exclusive event. I don't think any of the current generation of consoles were even announced at E3 as had been the custom.   The days of the ""old"" E3 have been gone for some time now. If it survives at all, it will likely be mostly with indie developers and have more of a ""Comicon/Comiket for mostly video games"" sort of feel to it I imagine. They'll have to reinvent what the event means and how it looks, maybe tie-in and push some major esports tournament, because I don't foresee the Big 3 being major players ever again.

Now everything is up in the air. The Big 3 just up and announce dates of streams randomly. I guess the companies are happy to have that freedom and developers are forced to crunch to have something ready to show. But the lack of it does kill enthusiasm for their products. The hype-cycle did serve a purpose in that regard.   Things like Nintendo Directs and State of Plays and whatever Microsoft calls theirs just don't command the attention they used to.   At least the Game Awards guarantees reveals and announcements, but you then have to sit through a bunch of other stuff you don't care about too, and those only interested in announcements from their preferred publishers and 1st parties are never guaranteed to see them there unlike dedicated events.   My enthusiasm for next-gen is in the negatives. The only 'holy-shit' moment of next-gen-ness for me was that playable Matrix UnReal demo. Call me when there are more games that match that kind of promise.

It's been a shell of its former self for a long time, getting less relevant year after year even before the big issues happened and with all these replacements -- like Summer Games Fest, Nintendo Directs, State of Play, etc. -- out there I really don't see it come back from a multi-year hiatus in any way that truly matters.   The name still turns heads, sure. It used to be like a second Christmas in the middle of the year. And even when it wasn't, it at least was a kind of amazing shitshow that was a must-watch just for a bit of second-hand-embarrassment and a laugh. But it's not either of those things anymore. I just doesn't mean much anymore.   MAYBE in the future, once they can do a big in-person event again without many major restrictions, it matters again but even that is a big maybe.

I don't even think any of the Big 3 have been to E3 the last couple times they've had it anyway. Sony pulled out years ago and just settled for their own thing (forget the name of their event in Nov/Dec), Xbox half pulled out where they kinda show up, but then show off a bunch of stuff outside the event. And Nintendo has been sort of picking and choosing which ones to attend and which to skip, like Sony also focusing more on their own exclusive event. I don't think any of the current generation of consoles were even announced at E3 as had been the custom.   The days of the ""old"" E3 have been gone for some time now. If it survives at all, it will likely be mostly with indie developers and have more of a ""Comicon/Comiket for mostly video games"" sort of feel to it I imagine. They'll have to reinvent what the event means and how it looks, maybe tie-in and push some major esports tournament, because I don't foresee the Big 3 being major players ever again.

Now everything is up in the air. The Big 3 just up and announce dates of streams randomly. I guess the companies are happy to have that freedom and developers are forced to crunch to have something ready to show. But the lack of it does kill enthusiasm for their products. The hype-cycle did serve a purpose in that regard.   Things like Nintendo Directs and State of Plays and whatever Microsoft calls theirs just don't command the attention they used to.   At least the Game Awards guarantees reveals and announcements, but you then have to sit through a bunch of other stuff you don't care about too, and those only interested in announcements from their preferred publishers and 1st parties are never guaranteed to see them there unlike dedicated events.   My enthusiasm for next-gen is in the negatives. The only 'holy-shit' moment of next-gen-ness for me was that playable Matrix UnReal demo. Call me when there are more games that match that kind of promise.

It's been a shell of its former self for a long time, getting less relevant year after year even before the big issues happened and with all these replacements -- like Summer Games Fest, Nintendo Directs, State of Play, etc. -- out there I really don't see it come back from a multi-year hiatus in any way that truly matters.   The name still turns heads, sure. It used to be like a second Christmas in the middle of the year. And even when it wasn't, it at least was a kind of amazing shitshow that was a must-watch just for a bit of second-hand-embarrassment and a laugh. But it's not either of those things anymore. I just doesn't mean much anymore.   MAYBE in the future, once they can do a big in-person event again without many major restrictions, it matters again but even that is a big maybe.

Considering Sony wasn't even part of E3 for the last two years, it's hard to think that there were any plans to begin with.

I don't even think any of the Big 3 have been to E3 the last couple times they've had it anyway. Sony pulled out years ago and just settled for their own thing (forget the name of their event in Nov/Dec), Xbox half pulled out where they kinda show up, but then show off a bunch of stuff outside the event. And Nintendo has been sort of picking and choosing which ones to attend and which to skip, like Sony also focusing more on their own exclusive event. I don't think any of the current generation of consoles were even announced at E3 as had been the custom.   The days of the ""old"" E3 have been gone for some time now. If it survives at all, it will likely be mostly with indie developers and have more of a ""Comicon/Comiket for mostly video games"" sort of feel to it I imagine. They'll have to reinvent what the event means and how it looks, maybe tie-in and push some major esports tournament, because I don't foresee the Big 3 being major players ever again.

Now everything is up in the air. The Big 3 just up and announce dates of streams randomly. I guess the companies are happy to have that freedom and developers are forced to crunch to have something ready to show. But the lack of it does kill enthusiasm for their products. The hype-cycle did serve a purpose in that regard.   Things like Nintendo Directs and State of Plays and whatever Microsoft calls theirs just don't command the attention they used to.   At least the Game Awards guarantees reveals and announcements, but you then have to sit through a bunch of other stuff you don't care about too, and those only interested in announcements from their preferred publishers and 1st parties are never guaranteed to see them there unlike dedicated events.   My enthusiasm for next-gen is in the negatives. The only 'holy-shit' moment of next-gen-ness for me was that playable Matrix UnReal demo. Call me when there are more games that match that kind of promise.

Community score: 4.8            Short episode this week! Only nine minutes long. I saw that there was some big post-credits thing, but didn't bother watching it—just kidding! One of my biggest issues with adaptations is the absence of finality. When it comes to light novels and manga—the two largest sources of anime—they're usually created with the goal of perpetual publication. But it's rare that any anime seeks to actually offer a full adaptation.    That said, Episode 23 is the ending 86 deserved all along. I'll admit, I previously said that I was very satisfied with the ending of the first cour. The idea that Spearhead Squadron had all been wiped out on their suicide mission and that Lena would work with a new group of 86 to overthrow the current system was narratively appealing, though not at all a feel-good ending like the one that was broadcast today.    This finale, on the other hand, was the perfect send-off for the cast, and we can imagine what sort of lives they'll be living henceforth. While the second cour began with the cast trying out different hobbies and then abandoning them for the battlefield, we see now that they've worked out a balance. It no longer seems like they're fighting just for the sake of fighting, but have finally found lives that they want to protect. It's incredibly sweet. And immediately off the back of finding absolution for his mercy killings, we discover that Nina didn't actually blame Shin for her brother's death, after all. It's a particularly wholesome scene.    Meanwhile, after the first credit roll, we check in on Lena properly for the first time in a while. The institutional discrimination against the 86 within San Magnolia is gone, largely due to there being no more institution. Who knew a robot zombie attack could cure racism? Of course, there's lingering bitterness among the white (haired) refugees, who now have to accept the aid of people of color(ed hair). It's been a long time since cour 1, so I'd forgotten how silly the hair racism looked.    Episode 23 wasn't the mind-blowing spectacle that the previous episode was, but one short sequence at the very end will stick with me for a while. Whoever first suggested Fido-cam is a storytelling genius. Anime is constantly looking for new ways to get viewers to feel closer to the characters, and the home movie style through Fido's lens is a particularly warm and fitting way to convey the cast's final thoughts.    Honestly, the whole finale is unbearably cheesy, but that's exactly what we all deserve. The reunion almost brought me to tears. We've been waiting all this time for Lena and the members of Spearhead to stand within the same frame together, and we got exactly that. Sure, it was absolutely ridiculous that Lena and Shin hold out their hands to each other to form the number “86”, but that's how a fluffy finale should feel.    Of course, the story will continue in some form. The eleventh light novel released in Japan last month, and I've been informed that there are some great stories to come. Not so sure about the implied Shin/Lena romance, though. Yen Press has the license to the series and the tenth English volume will be released in May. At the same time, I'd also strongly recommend getting your hands on the 86 Bandai model kits. They're not too difficult to build and they end up looking really similar to the ones in the anime.    On my end, I'll be saying goodbye to 86 here. It's been the highlight of 2021 (and now 2022, I guess) and absolutely deserved its Best New Anime award at Anime Trending. I reckon I'll be looking back fondly at the show for a while. Though, of course, if they do end up making more of this wonderful anime adaptation, I'll be right back here alongside you all.    Rating:                  86 Season 2 is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

Community score: 4.8            Short episode this week! Only nine minutes long. I saw that there was some big post-credits thing, but didn't bother watching it—just kidding! One of my biggest issues with adaptations is the absence of finality. When it comes to light novels and manga—the two largest sources of anime—they're usually created with the goal of perpetual publication. But it's rare that any anime seeks to actually offer a full adaptation.    That said, Episode 23 is the ending 86 deserved all along. I'll admit, I previously said that I was very satisfied with the ending of the first cour. The idea that Spearhead Squadron had all been wiped out on their suicide mission and that Lena would work with a new group of 86 to overthrow the current system was narratively appealing, though not at all a feel-good ending like the one that was broadcast today.    This finale, on the other hand, was the perfect send-off for the cast, and we can imagine what sort of lives they'll be living henceforth. While the second cour began with the cast trying out different hobbies and then abandoning them for the battlefield, we see now that they've worked out a balance. It no longer seems like they're fighting just for the sake of fighting, but have finally found lives that they want to protect. It's incredibly sweet. And immediately off the back of finding absolution for his mercy killings, we discover that Nina didn't actually blame Shin for her brother's death, after all. It's a particularly wholesome scene.    Meanwhile, after the first credit roll, we check in on Lena properly for the first time in a while. The institutional discrimination against the 86 within San Magnolia is gone, largely due to there being no more institution. Who knew a robot zombie attack could cure racism? Of course, there's lingering bitterness among the white (haired) refugees, who now have to accept the aid of people of color(ed hair). It's been a long time since cour 1, so I'd forgotten how silly the hair racism looked.    Episode 23 wasn't the mind-blowing spectacle that the previous episode was, but one short sequence at the very end will stick with me for a while. Whoever first suggested Fido-cam is a storytelling genius. Anime is constantly looking for new ways to get viewers to feel closer to the characters, and the home movie style through Fido's lens is a particularly warm and fitting way to convey the cast's final thoughts.    Honestly, the whole finale is unbearably cheesy, but that's exactly what we all deserve. The reunion almost brought me to tears. We've been waiting all this time for Lena and the members of Spearhead to stand within the same frame together, and we got exactly that. Sure, it was absolutely ridiculous that Lena and Shin hold out their hands to each other to form the number “86”, but that's how a fluffy finale should feel.    Of course, the story will continue in some form. The eleventh light novel released in Japan last month, and I've been informed that there are some great stories to come. Not so sure about the implied Shin/Lena romance, though. Yen Press has the license to the series and the tenth English volume will be released in May. At the same time, I'd also strongly recommend getting your hands on the 86 Bandai model kits. They're not too difficult to build and they end up looking really similar to the ones in the anime.    On my end, I'll be saying goodbye to 86 here. It's been the highlight of 2021 (and now 2022, I guess) and absolutely deserved its Best New Anime award at Anime Trending. I reckon I'll be looking back fondly at the show for a while. Though, of course, if they do end up making more of this wonderful anime adaptation, I'll be right back here alongside you all.

Community score: 4.8            Short episode this week! Only nine minutes long. I saw that there was some big post-credits thing, but didn't bother watching it—just kidding! One of my biggest issues with adaptations is the absence of finality. When it comes to light novels and manga—the two largest sources of anime—they're usually created with the goal of perpetual publication. But it's rare that any anime seeks to actually offer a full adaptation.    That said, Episode 23 is the ending 86 deserved all along. I'll admit, I previously said that I was very satisfied with the ending of the first cour. The idea that Spearhead Squadron had all been wiped out on their suicide mission and that Lena would work with a new group of 86 to overthrow the current system was narratively appealing, though not at all a feel-good ending like the one that was broadcast today.    This finale, on the other hand, was the perfect send-off for the cast, and we can imagine what sort of lives they'll be living henceforth. While the second cour began with the cast trying out different hobbies and then abandoning them for the battlefield, we see now that they've worked out a balance. It no longer seems like they're fighting just for the sake of fighting, but have finally found lives that they want to protect. It's incredibly sweet. And immediately off the back of finding absolution for his mercy killings, we discover that Nina didn't actually blame Shin for her brother's death, after all. It's a particularly wholesome scene.    Meanwhile, after the first credit roll, we check in on Lena properly for the first time in a while. The institutional discrimination against the 86 within San Magnolia is gone, largely due to there being no more institution. Who knew a robot zombie attack could cure racism? Of course, there's lingering bitterness among the white (haired) refugees, who now have to accept the aid of people of color(ed hair). It's been a long time since cour 1, so I'd forgotten how silly the hair racism looked.    Episode 23 wasn't the mind-blowing spectacle that the previous episode was, but one short sequence at the very end will stick with me for a while. Whoever first suggested Fido-cam is a storytelling genius. Anime is constantly looking for new ways to get viewers to feel closer to the characters, and the home movie style through Fido's lens is a particularly warm and fitting way to convey the cast's final thoughts.    Honestly, the whole finale is unbearably cheesy, but that's exactly what we all deserve. The reunion almost brought me to tears. We've been waiting all this time for Lena and the members of Spearhead to stand within the same frame together, and we got exactly that. Sure, it was absolutely ridiculous that Lena and Shin hold out their hands to each other to form the number “86”, but that's how a fluffy finale should feel.    Of course, the story will continue in some form. The eleventh light novel released in Japan last month, and I've been informed that there are some great stories to come. Not so sure about the implied Shin/Lena romance, though. Yen Press has the license to the series and the tenth English volume will be released in May. At the same time, I'd also strongly recommend getting your hands on the 86 Bandai model kits. They're not too difficult to build and they end up looking really similar to the ones in the anime.    On my end, I'll be saying goodbye to 86 here. It's been the highlight of 2021 (and now 2022, I guess) and absolutely deserved its Best New Anime award at Anime Trending. I reckon I'll be looking back fondly at the show for a while. Though, of course, if they do end up making more of this wonderful anime adaptation, I'll be right back here alongside you all.

Community score: 4.8            Short episode this week! Only nine minutes long. I saw that there was some big post-credits thing, but didn't bother watching it—just kidding! One of my biggest issues with adaptations is the absence of finality. When it comes to light novels and manga—the two largest sources of anime—they're usually created with the goal of perpetual publication. But it's rare that any anime seeks to actually offer a full adaptation.    That said, Episode 23 is the ending 86 deserved all along. I'll admit, I previously said that I was very satisfied with the ending of the first cour. The idea that Spearhead Squadron had all been wiped out on their suicide mission and that Lena would work with a new group of 86 to overthrow the current system was narratively appealing, though not at all a feel-good ending like the one that was broadcast today.    This finale, on the other hand, was the perfect send-off for the cast, and we can imagine what sort of lives they'll be living henceforth. While the second cour began with the cast trying out different hobbies and then abandoning them for the battlefield, we see now that they've worked out a balance. It no longer seems like they're fighting just for the sake of fighting, but have finally found lives that they want to protect. It's incredibly sweet. And immediately off the back of finding absolution for his mercy killings, we discover that Nina didn't actually blame Shin for her brother's death, after all. It's a particularly wholesome scene.    Meanwhile, after the first credit roll, we check in on Lena properly for the first time in a while. The institutional discrimination against the 86 within San Magnolia is gone, largely due to there being no more institution. Who knew a robot zombie attack could cure racism? Of course, there's lingering bitterness among the white (haired) refugees, who now have to accept the aid of people of color(ed hair). It's been a long time since cour 1, so I'd forgotten how silly the hair racism looked.    Episode 23 wasn't the mind-blowing spectacle that the previous episode was, but one short sequence at the very end will stick with me for a while. Whoever first suggested Fido-cam is a storytelling genius. Anime is constantly looking for new ways to get viewers to feel closer to the characters, and the home movie style through Fido's lens is a particularly warm and fitting way to convey the cast's final thoughts.    Honestly, the whole finale is unbearably cheesy, but that's exactly what we all deserve. The reunion almost brought me to tears. We've been waiting all this time for Lena and the members of Spearhead to stand within the same frame together, and we got exactly that. Sure, it was absolutely ridiculous that Lena and Shin hold out their hands to each other to form the number “86”, but that's how a fluffy finale should feel.    Of course, the story will continue in some form. The eleventh light novel released in Japan last month, and I've been informed that there are some great stories to come. Not so sure about the implied Shin/Lena romance, though. Yen Press has the license to the series and the tenth English volume will be released in May. At the same time, I'd also strongly recommend getting your hands on the 86 Bandai model kits. They're not too difficult to build and they end up looking really similar to the ones in the anime.    On my end, I'll be saying goodbye to 86 here. It's been the highlight of 2021 (and now 2022, I guess) and absolutely deserved its Best New Anime award at Anime Trending. I reckon I'll be looking back fondly at the show for a while. Though, of course, if they do end up making more of this wonderful anime adaptation, I'll be right back here alongside you all.

Of course, the story will continue in some form. The eleventh light novel released in Japan last month, and I've been informed that there are some great stories to come. Not so sure about the implied Shin/Lena romance, though. Yen Press has the license to the series and the tenth English volume will be released in May. At the same time, I'd also strongly recommend getting your hands on the 86 Bandai model kits. They're not too difficult to build and they end up looking really similar to the ones in the anime.    On my end, I'll be saying goodbye to 86 here. It's been the highlight of 2021 (and now 2022, I guess) and absolutely deserved its Best New Anime award at Anime Trending.

03-04-2022,anime,3,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/86-season-2/episode-23/.183828,Episode 23 - 86 Season 2 - Anime News Network:SEA,"                How would you rate episode 23 of 86 (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.8            Short episode this week! Only nine minutes long. I saw that there was some big post-credits thing, but didn't bother watching it—just kidding! One of my biggest issues with adaptations is the absence of finality. When it comes to light novels and manga—the two largest sources of anime—they're usually created with the goal of perpetual publication. But it's rare that any anime seeks to actually offer a full adaptation.    That said, Episode 23 is the ending 86 deserved all along. I'll admit, I previously said that I was very satisfied with the ending of the first cour. The idea that Spearhead Squadron had all been wiped out on their suicide mission and that Lena would work with a new group of 86 to overthrow the current system was narratively appealing, though not at all a feel-good ending like the one that was broadcast today.    This finale, on the other hand, was the perfect send-off for the cast, and we can imagine what sort of lives they'll be living henceforth. While the second cour began with the cast trying out different hobbies and then abandoning them for the battlefield, we see now that they've worked out a balance. It no longer seems like they're fighting just for the sake of fighting, but have finally found lives that they want to protect. It's incredibly sweet. And immediately off the back of finding absolution for his mercy killings, we discover that Nina didn't actually blame Shin for her brother's death, after all. It's a particularly wholesome scene.    Meanwhile, after the first credit roll, we check in on Lena properly for the first time in a while. The institutional discrimination against the 86 within San Magnolia is gone, largely due to there being no more institution. Who knew a robot zombie attack could cure racism? Of course, there's lingering bitterness among the white (haired) refugees, who now have to accept the aid of people of color(ed hair). It's been a long time since cour 1, so I'd forgotten how silly the hair racism looked.    Episode 23 wasn't the mind-blowing spectacle that the previous episode was, but one short sequence at the very end will stick with me for a while. Whoever first suggested Fido-cam is a storytelling genius. Anime is constantly looking for new ways to get viewers to feel closer to the characters, and the home movie style through Fido's lens is a particularly warm and fitting way to convey the cast's final thoughts.    Honestly, the whole finale is unbearably cheesy, but that's exactly what we all deserve. The reunion almost brought me to tears.

News 4-Nin wa Sorezore Uso o Tsuku School Comedy Anime to Air in 2022   posted on 2022-04-02 19:42 UTC-8 by Egan Loo          Madoka Kashihara's story of 4 girls with secret identities    The official website for the television anime of Madoka Kashihara's 4-Nin wa Sorezore Uso o Tsuku (Four People Lie in Their Own Way) manga formally opened on Saturday. The website announced that the anime will air in the ANiMAZiNG!!! programming block on ABC TV, TV Asahi, and 22 other stations this year.       The school comedy story follows four friends at a girls' school. They may seem like ordinary second-year junior high school students at first glance, but they are an alien, a ninja without a clan, a girl with supernatural powers, and a boy in girls' clothes.    Kashihara launched the manga in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine in April 2020. The series had gone on hiatus in August 2021. Kodansha published the manga's first compiled book volume in December 2020, and it will publish the second volume on April 7.

News 4-Nin wa Sorezore Uso o Tsuku School Comedy Anime to Air in 2022   posted on 2022-04-02 19:42 UTC-8 by Egan Loo          Madoka Kashihara's story of 4 girls with secret identities    The official website for the television anime of Madoka Kashihara's 4-Nin wa Sorezore Uso o Tsuku (Four People Lie in Their Own Way) manga formally opened on Saturday. The website announced that the anime will air in the ANiMAZiNG!!! programming block on ABC TV, TV Asahi, and 22 other stations this year.       The school comedy story follows four friends at a girls' school. They may seem like ordinary second-year junior high school students at first glance, but they are an alien, a ninja without a clan, a girl with supernatural powers, and a boy in girls' clothes.    Kashihara launched the manga in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine in April 2020. The series had gone on hiatus in August 2021. Kodansha published the manga's first compiled book volume in December 2020, and it will publish the second volume on April 7.

The website announced that the anime will air in the ANiMAZiNG!!! programming block on ABC TV, TV Asahi, and 22 other stations this year.       The school comedy story follows four friends at a girls' school. They may seem like ordinary second-year junior high school students at first glance, but they are an alien, a ninja without a clan, a girl with supernatural powers, and a boy in girls' clothes.    Kashihara launched the manga in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine in April 2020. The series had gone on hiatus in August 2021. Kodansha published the manga's first compiled book volume in December 2020, and it will publish the second volume on April 7.

REVIEW: Tokyo 24th Ward             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        Spider3PO    Joined: 08 Jan 2022 		    Posts: 16       Posted: Thu Jan 20, 2022 3:55 pm            A fair review. I enjoyed ep 1 & 2. But with 3, that tornado was left field. I didn't like that twist.   They had already started foreshadowing two different groups as being shady. And neither of them played into being at the heart of the crisis this week. Not even the group that tried to cheat.   It's as if the showrunner thought a unexpected plot twist was more important then putting in the work via foreshadowing to make it a meaningful payoff. Just to subvert expectations on what the crisis was going to be. It bugs me.    Unless there was some clue I missed in 2 & 3 to suggest a natural disaster was coming this episode? Cause I don't remember anything like that.

I don't know, everywhere? This is an A++ series for me but I don't even know where to begin in explaining how great I think it is...   Yes, you picked up on the Trolley one and the show pointed it out but the second chaos point was centered around... political ideals of all things, the Libertarian versus the Liberal. Survival of the fittest versus protecting the weak. ""Taking the third option"" in the Trolley problem is par for the course but it's a lot more nuanced when it comes to politics built into your blood.    It's not ""working together"" though, it should be working parallel.

Well, Lupin III already gave us a ""Gun of Jigen"" in episode 8 last month, so it wouldn't be surprising for the idea to show up here too.

The foreshadowing sets up the next crisis (as it spoiler[bleepin] should). Rather then coming out of left field with the tornado the last episode and killing off a semi-important support character. But I'm sure there's still time for the next episode to mess that up. Thanks episode 3 for planting that seed of doubt in me. Anyways...   Someone pointed out that the Hazard Cast machine maybe a macguffin that creates these chaotic scenarios. It's possible. But I've got a different theory involving Carneades.    The big bad Carneades is going to be a Moriarty like figure in this, exploiting Hazard Cast. With the Tornado, he likely prevented the radar from doing it's job. Rather then create a tornado with unknown tech.    With this new crisis involving the ship, I'm just going to wait and see before diving too deep into how this could connect to Carneades, Hazard Cast, and Asumi.   Random notes:  - Ran continues to baffle me. In episode 2, he's dunking bread crusts into an energy drink (gross).   - In this episode, Ran is like ""screw physics"" while his skateboard remains magically glued to his feet as he swings through the air like Tarzan in the Concrete Jungle.   - So Drug D is basically PCP (Angel Dust)?   To close, this series is pretty good. It's a B- for me so far. Maybe it can become an A+ in the future. We'll see.      Back to top                  Animegomaniac    Joined: 16 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 3888       Posted: Fri Jan 28, 2022 12:58 pm            I went into this series with one simple fact: Red, blue and green are a spectrum and these reviews that keep trying to break this analogue set up into digital descriptions is frustrating. The problems are broken down into binary, yes, but the solution should be more of a spectrum. To paraphrase what Mari aid about RBG: Everything can handle everything. But what about the individual colors?   ""Shu's in the middle."" Yes""... and that makes him central good."" No, that should make him True Neutral. Looking at Red we have Chaotic Good and at green, it's lawful evil.  Koki's an unapologetic fascist, can we come out and admit that? He's also a Libertarian but I feel that would kicking him while he's down already.    But why is Shu the superhero and not Ran? Something something responsibility, something power right? With great responsibility comes great power... and somebody went out of their way to make it into a superhero series. So Shu has to be the hero with hour of power because he's the responsible one.   That leaves Ran, who's interestingly no Robin Hood. He's self involved, he's particular, he's selective. Token Evil Teammate, the Heart and to top it off, the Lovable Rogue. No, I'm missing something about Ran because that should be heroic but something about Ran isn't, just like Koki by himself isn't a hero... Red should be hero, Blue should be lancer, hmm...   Is it really that simple? That Ran isn't dependable? ... and even the teamings are balanced; Ran has a group of Individuals he represents more than leads, Koki has no power over those SERG agents or the woman who's tied to, well, that but he does seem to lead them when the time comes to lead them.   Take this next problem... and review on it please. Shu is not going to be the one to decides who lives and who dies like Ran or Koki, the chaotic and evil people. He's going to save all of them because it's the right thing to do.   And I probably could keep going about this series as I do love it but not for what it's saying but what it says when it's not saying anything meaningful. So you'll see your politics reinforced because they're your politics and you can pick apart ones you disagree with because they're not.   Also... leaving this for last: the 24 ward is a manufactured place so all problems plaguing it are also manufactured, that's the point. The plot.

Quote:    The best it can offer is Ran trying to talk Kunai down with the base argument of ""This isn't how we do things"" because killing is badong.            So like this... but the part that came after it which negates it.  These reviews are awful.

As politely as possible. Cause there's some overthinking in there (eps 4 & 5), like Tokyo 24th Ward is supposed to be Shakespere when the level of writing is closer to Die Hard.   I don't know what you were expecting when a story arc is typically only an hour long (two episodes). They were never going to go deep into the division of classes. If that's what you were expecting. The first episode should have clued you in on how ""deep"" this show was going to be.     Quote:    But Tokyo 24th Ward can only articulate the world's stupidest moral dilemmas...            I would say specializes in simplified moral dilemmas that have to be solved in an hour of runtime. Maybe if this was Netflix, they could dedicate a season to a trolley dilemma. To really get to the heart of the issues the story may have brought up that led to the dilemma. But I imagine much of the audience would check out. Few showrunners could pull that off.     Quote:    ""I can't protect criminals,"" Koki intones at the end of this week's episode. It's a laugh given that we know the drug-dealing, land-sharking rich people on the ship are hardly law-abiding either            Do we though? Is the Captain of the ship in on it? The ship staff? The entertainment? Some of the plus ones invited to this? You're telling me they're all in on the shady deals? That just by being on the ship with shady people that it would be fine if the ship blew up?   Okay, if you say so.     Quote:    ...but it doesn't seem like any of the characters, nor the writer, nor the audience, walked away actually having learned anything about the ethics of these supposedly hard choices.            Yeah, I never expected that. Again, it should have been clear early on that this show was never going to be that deep or dramatic.

Given how much time is spent on the background of the supposed antagonist here, I was basically crushed when he was killed, though ofc not everyone on that boat was in any sense guilty. We aren’t meant to uncritically laud either the cops or the black-and-white thinking of Koki more generally here. Honestly, the amazing thing is that Ran and Koki can get along at all given their outlooks are so disparate, but it looks like this might be the thing that actually drives a wedge (which, good). Other than that, I didn’t love that Shu is kind of useless in this ep, but at the same time, I kind of like that action-man can’t just fix everything, too.

Quote:    how much of these events they actually set in motion purposefully            It's easy to mix up purposely and purposefully.  One trick is to think about their opposites, which are quite different:   purposely means ""on purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""by accident"" or ""unintentionally.""   purposefully means ""full of purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""pointlessly"" or ""aimlessly.""

Every week I'm ready to drop this, but then I don't and now we're half way through I'll probably stick with it (unless someone tells me it's slated for 24 or a split cour, in which case I'm out right now).   This show sure is lucky it doesn't air on the weekend, or I wouldn't have bothered with it.

I thought in a series trying to point out binary choices in an analogue world would have Azumi both alive, really alive, and 100% dead.... and then the series took a further step I didn't expect.   ""The system is called KANAE and its receptacle is BRAIN.""  My reaction was not and I mean not ""OMG, that is Azumi."" This isn't that kind of series; Ran's a coward, Koki's a fascist because they are what they look like as this is not a nuanced or subtle series. So if they give you Azumi's body but call her by her mother's name, it's time to ask yourself ""What's in the Brain Box?!""

As it was presented, lightning would strike the cranes making them fall and lightning would strike the only person who could prevent them from falling. So save the person from the lightning and then they can stop the cranes?  Where's the difficult choice?   I think my brain is just too clogged with general crap to function any more, so no one need waste their time explaining something that's obvious to the average viewer.  I probably won't be able to understand that either, and it's not like I'm losing sleep over this.

My first thought was, ""Um, didn't we already know all this before?""  I guess the origin of the stupid name ""0th"" was kinda new, but I hadn't been wondering about that at all before now.   Sadly, my main takeaway from this was wondering how he got cut on the right side of his face when the broken car window was on his left.

REVIEW: Tokyo 24th Ward             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        Spider3PO    Joined: 08 Jan 2022 		    Posts: 16       Posted: Thu Jan 20, 2022 3:55 pm            A fair review. I enjoyed ep 1 & 2. But with 3, that tornado was left field. I didn't like that twist.   They had already started foreshadowing two different groups as being shady. And neither of them played into being at the heart of the crisis this week. Not even the group that tried to cheat.   It's as if the showrunner thought a unexpected plot twist was more important then putting in the work via foreshadowing to make it a meaningful payoff. Just to subvert expectations on what the crisis was going to be. It bugs me.    Unless there was some clue I missed in 2 & 3 to suggest a natural disaster was coming this episode? Cause I don't remember anything like that.

I don't know, everywhere? This is an A++ series for me but I don't even know where to begin in explaining how great I think it is...   Yes, you picked up on the Trolley one and the show pointed it out but the second chaos point was centered around... political ideals of all things, the Libertarian versus the Liberal. Survival of the fittest versus protecting the weak. ""Taking the third option"" in the Trolley problem is par for the course but it's a lot more nuanced when it comes to politics built into your blood.    It's not ""working together"" though, it should be working parallel.

Well, Lupin III already gave us a ""Gun of Jigen"" in episode 8 last month, so it wouldn't be surprising for the idea to show up here too.

The foreshadowing sets up the next crisis (as it spoiler[bleepin] should). Rather then coming out of left field with the tornado the last episode and killing off a semi-important support character. But I'm sure there's still time for the next episode to mess that up. Thanks episode 3 for planting that seed of doubt in me. Anyways...   Someone pointed out that the Hazard Cast machine maybe a macguffin that creates these chaotic scenarios. It's possible. But I've got a different theory involving Carneades.    The big bad Carneades is going to be a Moriarty like figure in this, exploiting Hazard Cast. With the Tornado, he likely prevented the radar from doing it's job. Rather then create a tornado with unknown tech.    With this new crisis involving the ship, I'm just going to wait and see before diving too deep into how this could connect to Carneades, Hazard Cast, and Asumi.   Random notes:  - Ran continues to baffle me. In episode 2, he's dunking bread crusts into an energy drink (gross).   - In this episode, Ran is like ""screw physics"" while his skateboard remains magically glued to his feet as he swings through the air like Tarzan in the Concrete Jungle.   - So Drug D is basically PCP (Angel Dust)?   To close, this series is pretty good. It's a B- for me so far. Maybe it can become an A+ in the future. We'll see.      Back to top                  Animegomaniac    Joined: 16 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 3888       Posted: Fri Jan 28, 2022 12:58 pm            I went into this series with one simple fact: Red, blue and green are a spectrum and these reviews that keep trying to break this analogue set up into digital descriptions is frustrating. The problems are broken down into binary, yes, but the solution should be more of a spectrum. To paraphrase what Mari aid about RBG: Everything can handle everything. But what about the individual colors?   ""Shu's in the middle."" Yes""... and that makes him central good."" No, that should make him True Neutral. Looking at Red we have Chaotic Good and at green, it's lawful evil.  Koki's an unapologetic fascist, can we come out and admit that? He's also a Libertarian but I feel that would kicking him while he's down already.    But why is Shu the superhero and not Ran? Something something responsibility, something power right? With great responsibility comes great power... and somebody went out of their way to make it into a superhero series. So Shu has to be the hero with hour of power because he's the responsible one.   That leaves Ran, who's interestingly no Robin Hood. He's self involved, he's particular, he's selective. Token Evil Teammate, the Heart and to top it off, the Lovable Rogue. No, I'm missing something about Ran because that should be heroic but something about Ran isn't, just like Koki by himself isn't a hero... Red should be hero, Blue should be lancer, hmm...   Is it really that simple? That Ran isn't dependable? ... and even the teamings are balanced; Ran has a group of Individuals he represents more than leads, Koki has no power over those SERG agents or the woman who's tied to, well, that but he does seem to lead them when the time comes to lead them.   Take this next problem... and review on it please. Shu is not going to be the one to decides who lives and who dies like Ran or Koki, the chaotic and evil people. He's going to save all of them because it's the right thing to do.   And I probably could keep going about this series as I do love it but not for what it's saying but what it says when it's not saying anything meaningful. So you'll see your politics reinforced because they're your politics and you can pick apart ones you disagree with because they're not.   Also... leaving this for last: the 24 ward is a manufactured place so all problems plaguing it are also manufactured, that's the point. The plot.

Quote:    The best it can offer is Ran trying to talk Kunai down with the base argument of ""This isn't how we do things"" because killing is badong.            So like this... but the part that came after it which negates it.  These reviews are awful.

As politely as possible. Cause there's some overthinking in there (eps 4 & 5), like Tokyo 24th Ward is supposed to be Shakespere when the level of writing is closer to Die Hard.   I don't know what you were expecting when a story arc is typically only an hour long (two episodes). They were never going to go deep into the division of classes. If that's what you were expecting. The first episode should have clued you in on how ""deep"" this show was going to be.     Quote:    But Tokyo 24th Ward can only articulate the world's stupidest moral dilemmas...            I would say specializes in simplified moral dilemmas that have to be solved in an hour of runtime. Maybe if this was Netflix, they could dedicate a season to a trolley dilemma. To really get to the heart of the issues the story may have brought up that led to the dilemma. But I imagine much of the audience would check out. Few showrunners could pull that off.     Quote:    ""I can't protect criminals,"" Koki intones at the end of this week's episode. It's a laugh given that we know the drug-dealing, land-sharking rich people on the ship are hardly law-abiding either            Do we though? Is the Captain of the ship in on it? The ship staff? The entertainment? Some of the plus ones invited to this? You're telling me they're all in on the shady deals? That just by being on the ship with shady people that it would be fine if the ship blew up?   Okay, if you say so.     Quote:    ...but it doesn't seem like any of the characters, nor the writer, nor the audience, walked away actually having learned anything about the ethics of these supposedly hard choices.            Yeah, I never expected that. Again, it should have been clear early on that this show was never going to be that deep or dramatic.

Given how much time is spent on the background of the supposed antagonist here, I was basically crushed when he was killed, though ofc not everyone on that boat was in any sense guilty. We aren’t meant to uncritically laud either the cops or the black-and-white thinking of Koki more generally here. Honestly, the amazing thing is that Ran and Koki can get along at all given their outlooks are so disparate, but it looks like this might be the thing that actually drives a wedge (which, good). Other than that, I didn’t love that Shu is kind of useless in this ep, but at the same time, I kind of like that action-man can’t just fix everything, too.

Quote:    how much of these events they actually set in motion purposefully            It's easy to mix up purposely and purposefully.  One trick is to think about their opposites, which are quite different:   purposely means ""on purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""by accident"" or ""unintentionally.""   purposefully means ""full of purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""pointlessly"" or ""aimlessly.""

Every week I'm ready to drop this, but then I don't and now we're half way through I'll probably stick with it (unless someone tells me it's slated for 24 or a split cour, in which case I'm out right now).   This show sure is lucky it doesn't air on the weekend, or I wouldn't have bothered with it.

I thought in a series trying to point out binary choices in an analogue world would have Azumi both alive, really alive, and 100% dead.... and then the series took a further step I didn't expect.   ""The system is called KANAE and its receptacle is BRAIN.""  My reaction was not and I mean not ""OMG, that is Azumi."" This isn't that kind of series; Ran's a coward, Koki's a fascist because they are what they look like as this is not a nuanced or subtle series. So if they give you Azumi's body but call her by her mother's name, it's time to ask yourself ""What's in the Brain Box?!""

As it was presented, lightning would strike the cranes making them fall and lightning would strike the only person who could prevent them from falling. So save the person from the lightning and then they can stop the cranes?  Where's the difficult choice?   I think my brain is just too clogged with general crap to function any more, so no one need waste their time explaining something that's obvious to the average viewer.  I probably won't be able to understand that either, and it's not like I'm losing sleep over this.

My first thought was, ""Um, didn't we already know all this before?""  I guess the origin of the stupid name ""0th"" was kinda new, but I hadn't been wondering about that at all before now.   Sadly, my main takeaway from this was wondering how he got cut on the right side of his face when the broken car window was on his left.

I enjoyed ep 1 & 2. But with 3, that tornado was left field. I didn't like that twist.   They had already started foreshadowing two different groups as being shady. And neither of them played into being at the heart of the crisis this week. Not even the group that tried to cheat.   It's as if the showrunner thought a unexpected plot twist was more important then putting in the work via foreshadowing to make it a meaningful payoff. Just to subvert expectations on what the crisis was going to be. It bugs me.    Unless there was some clue I missed in 2 & 3 to suggest a natural disaster was coming this episode? Cause I don't remember anything like that.

I don't know, everywhere? This is an A++ series for me but I don't even know where to begin in explaining how great I think it is...   Yes, you picked up on the Trolley one and the show pointed it out but the second chaos point was centered around... political ideals of all things, the Libertarian versus the Liberal. Survival of the fittest versus protecting the weak. ""Taking the third option"" in the Trolley problem is par for the course but it's a lot more nuanced when it comes to politics built into your blood.    It's not ""working together"" though, it should be working parallel.

Well, Lupin III already gave us a ""Gun of Jigen"" in episode 8 last month, so it wouldn't be surprising for the idea to show up here too.       Back to top                  Spider3PO    Joined: 08 Jan 2022 		    Posts: 16       Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2022 3:32 pm            Episode 4: Corrects the ship, so to speak. The foreshadowing sets up the next crisis (as it spoiler[bleepin] should). Rather then coming out of left field with the tornado the last episode and killing off a semi-important support character. But I'm sure there's still time for the next episode to mess that up. Thanks episode 3 for planting that seed of doubt in me. Anyways...   Someone pointed out that the Hazard Cast machine maybe a macguffin that creates these chaotic scenarios. It's possible. But I've got a different theory involving Carneades.    The big bad Carneades is going to be a Moriarty like figure in this, exploiting Hazard Cast. With the Tornado, he likely prevented the radar from doing it's job. Rather then create a tornado with unknown tech.    With this new crisis involving the ship, I'm just going to wait and see before diving too deep into how this could connect to Carneades, Hazard Cast, and Asumi.   Random notes:  - Ran continues to baffle me. In episode 2, he's dunking bread crusts into an energy drink (gross).   - In this episode, Ran is like ""screw physics"" while his skateboard remains magically glued to his feet as he swings through the air like Tarzan in the Concrete Jungle.   - So Drug D is basically PCP (Angel Dust)?   To close, this series is pretty good. It's a B- for me so far. Maybe it can become an A+ in the future. We'll see.

The problems are broken down into binary, yes, but the solution should be more of a spectrum. To paraphrase what Mari aid about RBG: Everything can handle everything. But what about the individual colors?   ""Shu's in the middle."" Yes""... and that makes him central good."" No, that should make him True Neutral. Looking at Red we have Chaotic Good and at green, it's lawful evil.  Koki's an unapologetic fascist, can we come out and admit that? He's also a Libertarian but I feel that would kicking him while he's down already.    But why is Shu the superhero and not Ran? Something something responsibility, something power right? With great responsibility comes great power... and somebody went out of their way to make it into a superhero series. So Shu has to be the hero with hour of power because he's the responsible one.   That leaves Ran, who's interestingly no Robin Hood. He's self involved, he's particular, he's selective. Token Evil Teammate, the Heart and to top it off, the Lovable Rogue. No, I'm missing something about Ran because that should be heroic but something about Ran isn't, just like Koki by himself isn't a hero... Red should be hero, Blue should be lancer, hmm...   Is it really that simple? That Ran isn't dependable? ... and even the teamings are balanced; Ran has a group of Individuals he represents more than leads, Koki has no power over those SERG agents or the woman who's tied to, well, that but he does seem to lead them when the time comes to lead them.   Take this next problem... and review on it please. Shu is not going to be the one to decides who lives and who dies like Ran or Koki, the chaotic and evil people. He's going to save all of them because it's the right thing to do.   And I probably could keep going about this series as I do love it but not for what it's saying but what it says when it's not saying anything meaningful. So you'll see your politics reinforced because they're your politics and you can pick apart ones you disagree with because they're not.   Also... leaving this for last: the 24 ward is a manufactured place so all problems plaguing it are also manufactured, that's the point. The plot.

As politely as possible. Cause there's some overthinking in there (eps 4 & 5), like Tokyo 24th Ward is supposed to be Shakespere when the level of writing is closer to Die Hard.   I don't know what you were expecting when a story arc is typically only an hour long (two episodes). They were never going to go deep into the division of classes. If that's what you were expecting. The first episode should have clued you in on how ""deep"" this show was going to be.     Quote:    But Tokyo 24th Ward can only articulate the world's stupidest moral dilemmas...            I would say specializes in simplified moral dilemmas that have to be solved in an hour of runtime. Maybe if this was Netflix, they could dedicate a season to a trolley dilemma. To really get to the heart of the issues the story may have brought up that led to the dilemma. But I imagine much of the audience would check out. Few showrunners could pull that off.     Quote:    ""I can't protect criminals,"" Koki intones at the end of this week's episode. It's a laugh given that we know the drug-dealing, land-sharking rich people on the ship are hardly law-abiding either            Do we though? Is the Captain of the ship in on it? The ship staff? The entertainment? Some of the plus ones invited to this? You're telling me they're all in on the shady deals? That just by being on the ship with shady people that it would be fine if the ship blew up?   Okay, if you say so.     Quote:    ...but it doesn't seem like any of the characters, nor the writer, nor the audience, walked away actually having learned anything about the ethics of these supposedly hard choices.            Yeah, I never expected that. Again, it should have been clear early on that this show was never going to be that deep or dramatic.

Given how much time is spent on the background of the supposed antagonist here, I was basically crushed when he was killed, though ofc not everyone on that boat was in any sense guilty. We aren’t meant to uncritically laud either the cops or the black-and-white thinking of Koki more generally here. Honestly, the amazing thing is that Ran and Koki can get along at all given their outlooks are so disparate, but it looks like this might be the thing that actually drives a wedge (which, good). Other than that, I didn’t love that Shu is kind of useless in this ep, but at the same time, I kind of like that action-man can’t just fix everything, too.

Quote:    how much of these events they actually set in motion purposefully            It's easy to mix up purposely and purposefully.  One trick is to think about their opposites, which are quite different:   purposely means ""on purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""by accident"" or ""unintentionally.""   purposefully means ""full of purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""pointlessly"" or ""aimlessly.""

I thought in a series trying to point out binary choices in an analogue world would have Azumi both alive, really alive, and 100% dead.... and then the series took a further step I didn't expect.   ""The system is called KANAE and its receptacle is BRAIN.""  My reaction was not and I mean not ""OMG, that is Azumi."" This isn't that kind of series; Ran's a coward, Koki's a fascist because they are what they look like as this is not a nuanced or subtle series. So if they give you Azumi's body but call her by her mother's name, it's time to ask yourself ""What's in the Brain Box?!""

As it was presented, lightning would strike the cranes making them fall and lightning would strike the only person who could prevent them from falling. So save the person from the lightning and then they can stop the cranes?  Where's the difficult choice?   I think my brain is just too clogged with general crap to function any more, so no one need waste their time explaining something that's obvious to the average viewer.  I probably won't be able to understand that either, and it's not like I'm losing sleep over this.

Sadly, my main takeaway from this was wondering how he got cut on the right side of his face when the broken car window was on his left.

I enjoyed ep 1 & 2. But with 3, that tornado was left field. I didn't like that twist.   They had already started foreshadowing two different groups as being shady. And neither of them played into being at the heart of the crisis this week. Not even the group that tried to cheat.   It's as if the showrunner thought a unexpected plot twist was more important then putting in the work via foreshadowing to make it a meaningful payoff. Just to subvert expectations on what the crisis was going to be. It bugs me.    Unless there was some clue I missed in 2 & 3 to suggest a natural disaster was coming this episode? Cause I don't remember anything like that.

I don't know, everywhere? This is an A++ series for me but I don't even know where to begin in explaining how great I think it is...   Yes, you picked up on the Trolley one and the show pointed it out but the second chaos point was centered around... political ideals of all things, the Libertarian versus the Liberal. Survival of the fittest versus protecting the weak. ""Taking the third option"" in the Trolley problem is par for the course but it's a lot more nuanced when it comes to politics built into your blood.    It's not ""working together"" though, it should be working parallel.

The foreshadowing sets up the next crisis (as it spoiler[bleepin] should). Rather then coming out of left field with the tornado the last episode and killing off a semi-important support character. But I'm sure there's still time for the next episode to mess that up. Thanks episode 3 for planting that seed of doubt in me. Anyways...   Someone pointed out that the Hazard Cast machine maybe a macguffin that creates these chaotic scenarios. It's possible. But I've got a different theory involving Carneades.    The big bad Carneades is going to be a Moriarty like figure in this, exploiting Hazard Cast. With the Tornado, he likely prevented the radar from doing it's job. Rather then create a tornado with unknown tech.    With this new crisis involving the ship, I'm just going to wait and see before diving too deep into how this could connect to Carneades, Hazard Cast, and Asumi.   Random notes:  - Ran continues to baffle me. In episode 2, he's dunking bread crusts into an energy drink (gross).   - In this episode, Ran is like ""screw physics"" while his skateboard remains magically glued to his feet as he swings through the air like Tarzan in the Concrete Jungle.   - So Drug D is basically PCP (Angel Dust)?   To close, this series is pretty good. It's a B- for me so far. Maybe it can become an A+ in the future. We'll see.

Take this next problem... and review on it please. Shu is not going to be the one to decides who lives and who dies like Ran or Koki, the chaotic and evil people. He's going to save all of them because it's the right thing to do.   And I probably could keep going about this series as I do love it but not for what it's saying but what it says when it's not saying anything meaningful. So you'll see your politics reinforced because they're your politics and you can pick apart ones you disagree with because they're not.   Also... leaving this for last: the 24 ward is a manufactured place so all problems plaguing it are also manufactured, that's the point. The plot.

As politely as possible. Cause there's some overthinking in there (eps 4 & 5), like Tokyo 24th Ward is supposed to be Shakespere when the level of writing is closer to Die Hard.   I don't know what you were expecting when a story arc is typically only an hour long (two episodes). They were never going to go deep into the division of classes. If that's what you were expecting. The first episode should have clued you in on how ""deep"" this show was going to be.     Quote:    But Tokyo 24th Ward can only articulate the world's stupidest moral dilemmas...            I would say specializes in simplified moral dilemmas that have to be solved in an hour of runtime. Maybe if this was Netflix, they could dedicate a season to a trolley dilemma. To really get to the heart of the issues the story may have brought up that led to the dilemma. But I imagine much of the audience would check out. Few showrunners could pull that off.     Quote:    ""I can't protect criminals,"" Koki intones at the end of this week's episode. It's a laugh given that we know the drug-dealing, land-sharking rich people on the ship are hardly law-abiding either            Do we though? Is the Captain of the ship in on it? The ship staff? The entertainment? Some of the plus ones invited to this? You're telling me they're all in on the shady deals? That just by being on the ship with shady people that it would be fine if the ship blew up?   Okay, if you say so.     Quote:    ...but it doesn't seem like any of the characters, nor the writer, nor the audience, walked away actually having learned anything about the ethics of these supposedly hard choices.            Yeah, I never expected that. Again, it should have been clear early on that this show was never going to be that deep or dramatic.

Given how much time is spent on the background of the supposed antagonist here, I was basically crushed when he was killed, though ofc not everyone on that boat was in any sense guilty. We aren’t meant to uncritically laud either the cops or the black-and-white thinking of Koki more generally here. Honestly, the amazing thing is that Ran and Koki can get along at all given their outlooks are so disparate, but it looks like this might be the thing that actually drives a wedge (which, good). Other than that, I didn’t love that Shu is kind of useless in this ep, but at the same time, I kind of like that action-man can’t just fix everything, too.

Quote:    how much of these events they actually set in motion purposefully            It's easy to mix up purposely and purposefully.  One trick is to think about their opposites, which are quite different:   purposely means ""on purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""by accident"" or ""unintentionally.""   purposefully means ""full of purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""pointlessly"" or ""aimlessly.""

I thought in a series trying to point out binary choices in an analogue world would have Azumi both alive, really alive, and 100% dead.... and then the series took a further step I didn't expect.   ""The system is called KANAE and its receptacle is BRAIN.""  My reaction was not and I mean not ""OMG, that is Azumi."" This isn't that kind of series; Ran's a coward, Koki's a fascist because they are what they look like as this is not a nuanced or subtle series. So if they give you Azumi's body but call her by her mother's name, it's time to ask yourself ""What's in the Brain Box?!""

As it was presented, lightning would strike the cranes making them fall and lightning would strike the only person who could prevent them from falling. So save the person from the lightning and then they can stop the cranes?  Where's the difficult choice?   I think my brain is just too clogged with general crap to function any more, so no one need waste their time explaining something that's obvious to the average viewer.  I probably won't be able to understand that either, and it's not like I'm losing sleep over this.

My first thought was, ""Um, didn't we already know all this before?""  I guess the origin of the stupid name ""0th"" was kinda new, but I hadn't been wondering about that at all before now.   Sadly, my main takeaway from this was wondering how he got cut on the right side of his face when the broken car window was on his left.
