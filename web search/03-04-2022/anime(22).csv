News Laid-Back Camp Movie's Teaser Previews Cast, Now Grown-Up   posted on 2022-03-31 18:22 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Song artists, more staff, designs also posted for story about building campsite    The official website for the anime of Afro's Yurucamp (Yurukyan△, Laid-Back Camp Δ) manga posted the teaser trailer, teaser visual, and character visuals for the upcoming Eiga Yurukyan△ (Laid-Back Camp Movie)  on Thursday. The teaser trailer and visuals show the familiar characters, now grown-up, reuniting to construct a campsite. The trailer also posted more of the staff and the theme song artists.         Nadeshiko is now working at an outdoors goods store in Tokyo.   Rin is now working as an editor at a publisher in Nagoya.    Chiaki worked at a Tokyo event organizer, but made a figurative U-turn to work at Yamanashi prefecture's tourism promotion organization.     Aoi now works as an instructor at a Yamanashi elementary school.    Saitō now works as a trimmer at a Yokohama pet salon.     Singer Asaka performs the opening theme song ""Sun Is Coming Up"" as heard in the teaser above. Eri Sasaki performs the ending theme song ""Mimosa.""    The newly announced staff members are:    Prop Design: Miho Imoto, Noriko Tsutsumiya   Mechanical Design: Daisuke Endō, Hajime Maruo  Color Key Artist: Taeko Mizuno (Studio Road) Art Director: Yoshimi Umino (Production ai) Compositing Director of Photography: Hiroaki Tanaka (Studio Twinkle) Digital Work: C-Station Digital  CG Work: Yoshifumi Hirakawa (M.S.C) Sound Director: Takeshi Takadera  Sound Production: HALF H·P STUDIO  Music: Akiyuki Tateyama  Music Production: MAGES.    The film staff has been posting a series of ""candid photo visuals"" of the characters in their daily life before the film opens. The first visual features Nadeshiko Kagamihara hanging out a sleeping bag and blankets to dry on her veranda, and the second features Rin Shima taking a walk past skyscrapers at night, her warm breath visible in the chilly air. The third visual features Chiaki Ōgaki sitting by the roadside to drink, while flags of the real-life Taihaku Cherry Blossom Festival wave in the background.  The fourth visual features Aoi Inuyama, and the fifth features Ena Saitō and her pet dog Chikuwa sitting on a bench apparently in a train station:                 The television anime's five main cast members are reprising their roles, and the staff members returning from the television anime include:    Director: Yoshiaki Kyougoku  Script: Jin Tanaka, Mutsumi Ito  Character Design: Mutsumi Sasaki  Production: DeNA Contents Planning Department Animation Production: C-Station    Afro said that the staff checked back with the manga creator at nearly every step of the production from the earliest script draft and designs. The creator noted that the characters are a little bit older as well as the personal anticipation at seeing what even Afro has not seen yet. Director Yoshiaki Kyougoku thanked the fans for their support which made this film happen, and joked about once again going location-scouting and eating delicious camp food while making anime.    Shochiku is distributing the film, which will open on July 1.    The anime adapts Afro's ""slow outdoor manga"" which follows two young women. Rin likes to go camping by herself along the lakes that provide a scenic view of Mt. Fuji. Nadeshiko loves to take cycling trips by herself to places where she can see Mt. Fuji. After they meet, Rin and Nadeshiko take camping trips, eat cup ramen together, and enjoy the scenery.    The first anime premiered in January 2018, and Crunchyroll streamed the 12-episode series as it aired. The ROOM CAMP (Heya Camp) short anime spinoff premiered in January 2020. The second season of the anime premiered in January and ended in April. The cast and staff announced the movie in an October 2018 event.    Afro launched the manga in Houbunsha's Manga Time Kirara Forward magazine in 2015. Yen Press began releasing the manga in English in March 2018.    The anime's first smartphone game is slated for iOS and Android devices this year. The anime already inspired  MAGES' Yurucamp Have a Nice Day! game for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch last November.

News Laid-Back Camp Movie's Teaser Previews Cast, Now Grown-Up   posted on 2022-03-31 18:22 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Song artists, more staff, designs also posted for story about building campsite    The official website for the anime of Afro's Yurucamp (Yurukyan△, Laid-Back Camp Δ) manga posted the teaser trailer, teaser visual, and character visuals for the upcoming Eiga Yurukyan△ (Laid-Back Camp Movie)  on Thursday. The teaser trailer and visuals show the familiar characters, now grown-up, reuniting to construct a campsite. The trailer also posted more of the staff and the theme song artists.         Nadeshiko is now working at an outdoors goods store in Tokyo.   Rin is now working as an editor at a publisher in Nagoya.    Chiaki worked at a Tokyo event organizer, but made a figurative U-turn to work at Yamanashi prefecture's tourism promotion organization.     Aoi now works as an instructor at a Yamanashi elementary school.    Saitō now works as a trimmer at a Yokohama pet salon.     Singer Asaka performs the opening theme song ""Sun Is Coming Up"" as heard in the teaser above. Eri Sasaki performs the ending theme song ""Mimosa.""    The newly announced staff members are:    Prop Design: Miho Imoto, Noriko Tsutsumiya   Mechanical Design: Daisuke Endō, Hajime Maruo  Color Key Artist: Taeko Mizuno (Studio Road) Art Director: Yoshimi Umino (Production ai) Compositing Director of Photography: Hiroaki Tanaka (Studio Twinkle) Digital Work: C-Station Digital  CG Work: Yoshifumi Hirakawa (M.S.C) Sound Director: Takeshi Takadera  Sound Production: HALF H·P STUDIO  Music: Akiyuki Tateyama  Music Production: MAGES.    The film staff has been posting a series of ""candid photo visuals"" of the characters in their daily life before the film opens. The first visual features Nadeshiko Kagamihara hanging out a sleeping bag and blankets to dry on her veranda, and the second features Rin Shima taking a walk past skyscrapers at night, her warm breath visible in the chilly air. The third visual features Chiaki Ōgaki sitting by the roadside to drink, while flags of the real-life Taihaku Cherry Blossom Festival wave in the background.  The fourth visual features Aoi Inuyama, and the fifth features Ena Saitō and her pet dog Chikuwa sitting on a bench apparently in a train station:                 The television anime's five main cast members are reprising their roles, and the staff members returning from the television anime include:    Director: Yoshiaki Kyougoku  Script: Jin Tanaka, Mutsumi Ito  Character Design: Mutsumi Sasaki  Production: DeNA Contents Planning Department Animation Production: C-Station    Afro said that the staff checked back with the manga creator at nearly every step of the production from the earliest script draft and designs. The creator noted that the characters are a little bit older as well as the personal anticipation at seeing what even Afro has not seen yet. Director Yoshiaki Kyougoku thanked the fans for their support which made this film happen, and joked about once again going location-scouting and eating delicious camp food while making anime.    Shochiku is distributing the film, which will open on July 1.    The anime adapts Afro's ""slow outdoor manga"" which follows two young women. Rin likes to go camping by herself along the lakes that provide a scenic view of Mt. Fuji. Nadeshiko loves to take cycling trips by herself to places where she can see Mt. Fuji. After they meet, Rin and Nadeshiko take camping trips, eat cup ramen together, and enjoy the scenery.    The first anime premiered in January 2018, and Crunchyroll streamed the 12-episode series as it aired. The ROOM CAMP (Heya Camp) short anime spinoff premiered in January 2020. The second season of the anime premiered in January and ended in April. The cast and staff announced the movie in an October 2018 event.    Afro launched the manga in Houbunsha's Manga Time Kirara Forward magazine in 2015. Yen Press began releasing the manga in English in March 2018.    The anime's first smartphone game is slated for iOS and Android devices this year. The anime already inspired  MAGES' Yurucamp Have a Nice Day! game for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch last November.

News Laid-Back Camp Movie's Teaser Previews Cast, Now Grown-Up   posted on 2022-03-31 18:22 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Song artists, more staff, designs also posted for story about building campsite    The official website for the anime of Afro's Yurucamp (Yurukyan△, Laid-Back Camp Δ) manga posted the teaser trailer, teaser visual, and character visuals for the upcoming Eiga Yurukyan△ (Laid-Back Camp Movie)  on Thursday. The teaser trailer and visuals show the familiar characters, now grown-up, reuniting to construct a campsite. The trailer also posted more of the staff and the theme song artists.         Nadeshiko is now working at an outdoors goods store in Tokyo.   Rin is now working as an editor at a publisher in Nagoya.    Chiaki worked at a Tokyo event organizer, but made a figurative U-turn to work at Yamanashi prefecture's tourism promotion organization.     Aoi now works as an instructor at a Yamanashi elementary school.    Saitō now works as a trimmer at a Yokohama pet salon.     Singer Asaka performs the opening theme song ""Sun Is Coming Up"" as heard in the teaser above. Eri Sasaki performs the ending theme song ""Mimosa.""    The newly announced staff members are:    Prop Design: Miho Imoto, Noriko Tsutsumiya   Mechanical Design: Daisuke Endō, Hajime Maruo  Color Key Artist: Taeko Mizuno (Studio Road) Art Director: Yoshimi Umino (Production ai) Compositing Director of Photography: Hiroaki Tanaka (Studio Twinkle) Digital Work: C-Station Digital  CG Work: Yoshifumi Hirakawa (M.S.C) Sound Director: Takeshi Takadera  Sound Production: HALF H·P STUDIO  Music: Akiyuki Tateyama  Music Production: MAGES.    The film staff has been posting a series of ""candid photo visuals"" of the characters in their daily life before the film opens. The first visual features Nadeshiko Kagamihara hanging out a sleeping bag and blankets to dry on her veranda, and the second features Rin Shima taking a walk past skyscrapers at night, her warm breath visible in the chilly air. The third visual features Chiaki Ōgaki sitting by the roadside to drink, while flags of the real-life Taihaku Cherry Blossom Festival wave in the background.  The fourth visual features Aoi Inuyama, and the fifth features Ena Saitō and her pet dog Chikuwa sitting on a bench apparently in a train station:                 The television anime's five main cast members are reprising their roles, and the staff members returning from the television anime include:    Director: Yoshiaki Kyougoku  Script: Jin Tanaka, Mutsumi Ito  Character Design: Mutsumi Sasaki  Production: DeNA Contents Planning Department Animation Production: C-Station    Afro said that the staff checked back with the manga creator at nearly every step of the production from the earliest script draft and designs. The creator noted that the characters are a little bit older as well as the personal anticipation at seeing what even Afro has not seen yet. Director Yoshiaki Kyougoku thanked the fans for their support which made this film happen, and joked about once again going location-scouting and eating delicious camp food while making anime.    Shochiku is distributing the film, which will open on July 1.    The anime adapts Afro's ""slow outdoor manga"" which follows two young women. Rin likes to go camping by herself along the lakes that provide a scenic view of Mt. Fuji. Nadeshiko loves to take cycling trips by herself to places where she can see Mt. Fuji. After they meet, Rin and Nadeshiko take camping trips, eat cup ramen together, and enjoy the scenery.    The first anime premiered in January 2018, and Crunchyroll streamed the 12-episode series as it aired. The ROOM CAMP (Heya Camp) short anime spinoff premiered in January 2020. The second season of the anime premiered in January and ended in April. The cast and staff announced the movie in an October 2018 event.    Afro launched the manga in Houbunsha's Manga Time Kirara Forward magazine in 2015. Yen Press began releasing the manga in English in March 2018.    The anime's first smartphone game is slated for iOS and Android devices this year.

The teaser trailer and visuals show the familiar characters, now grown-up, reuniting to construct a campsite. The trailer also posted more of the staff and the theme song artists.         Nadeshiko is now working at an outdoors goods store in Tokyo.   Rin is now working as an editor at a publisher in Nagoya.    Chiaki worked at a Tokyo event organizer, but made a figurative U-turn to work at Yamanashi prefecture's tourism promotion organization.     Aoi now works as an instructor at a Yamanashi elementary school.    Saitō now works as a trimmer at a Yokohama pet salon.     Singer Asaka performs the opening theme song ""Sun Is Coming Up"" as heard in the teaser above. Eri Sasaki performs the ending theme song ""Mimosa.""    The newly announced staff members are:    Prop Design: Miho Imoto, Noriko Tsutsumiya   Mechanical Design: Daisuke Endō, Hajime Maruo  Color Key Artist: Taeko Mizuno (Studio Road) Art Director: Yoshimi Umino (Production ai) Compositing Director of Photography: Hiroaki Tanaka (Studio Twinkle) Digital Work: C-Station Digital  CG Work: Yoshifumi Hirakawa (M.S.C) Sound Director: Takeshi Takadera  Sound Production: HALF H·P STUDIO  Music: Akiyuki Tateyama  Music Production: MAGES.    The film staff has been posting a series of ""candid photo visuals"" of the characters in their daily life before the film opens. The first visual features Nadeshiko Kagamihara hanging out a sleeping bag and blankets to dry on her veranda, and the second features Rin Shima taking a walk past skyscrapers at night, her warm breath visible in the chilly air. The third visual features Chiaki Ōgaki sitting by the roadside to drink, while flags of the real-life Taihaku Cherry Blossom Festival wave in the background.  The fourth visual features Aoi Inuyama, and the fifth features Ena Saitō and her pet dog Chikuwa sitting on a bench apparently in a train station:                 The television anime's five main cast members are reprising their roles, and the staff members returning from the television anime include:    Director: Yoshiaki Kyougoku  Script: Jin Tanaka, Mutsumi Ito  Character Design: Mutsumi Sasaki  Production: DeNA Contents Planning Department Animation Production: C-Station    Afro said that the staff checked back with the manga creator at nearly every step of the production from the earliest script draft and designs. The creator noted that the characters are a little bit older as well as the personal anticipation at seeing what even Afro has not seen yet. Director Yoshiaki Kyougoku thanked the fans for their support which made this film happen, and joked about once again going location-scouting and eating delicious camp food while making anime.    Shochiku is distributing the film, which will open on July 1.    The anime adapts Afro's ""slow outdoor manga"" which follows two young women. Rin likes to go camping by herself along the lakes that provide a scenic view of Mt. Fuji. Nadeshiko loves to take cycling trips by herself to places where she can see Mt. Fuji. After they meet, Rin and Nadeshiko take camping trips, eat cup ramen together, and enjoy the scenery.    The first anime premiered in January 2018, and Crunchyroll streamed the 12-episode series as it aired. The ROOM CAMP (Heya Camp) short anime spinoff premiered in January 2020. The second season of the anime premiered in January and ended in April. The cast and staff announced the movie in an October 2018 event.    Afro launched the manga in Houbunsha's Manga Time Kirara Forward magazine in 2015. Yen Press began releasing the manga in English in March 2018.    The anime's first smartphone game is slated for iOS and Android devices this year. The anime already inspired  MAGES' Yurucamp Have a Nice Day! game for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch last November.

News Neko Works Confirms Newly Announced Inupara: Dogs Paradise Game is 'Not a Joke'   posted on 2022-04-02 02:22 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo          Inupara stars six different dog girls each representing a popular breed.    Neko Works, the creators of the Nekopara visual novels, announced the Inupara: Dogs Paradise project with an opening song video and character profiles in multiple languages on Friday, April 1. The official YouTube channel began streaming the project's opening video on YouTube, which features the theme song  ""Inu no Ōta"" by singer Nanahira. The channel also pinned a comment stating in English that the video posted on April Fool's Day was ""Not a Joke.""      Inupara stars six different dog girls each representing a popular breed. The game's protagonist is a college student who shuns the usual social life in favor of spending quality time with his two dogs. One day, he wakes up to find his faithful pooches transformed into girls. The girls include Himawari the shiba inu, Tanpopo the pomeranian, Mimosa the chihuahua, Anemone the standard poodle, Botan the Pembroke Welsh corgi, and Calla the Siberian husky.                                             #INUPARA pic.twitter.com/xtxuYTKBhx— NEKO WORKs/NEKOPARA Official (@nekopara_pr) March 31, 2022     The team has previously announced a new game on April 1 as a joke, only to later turn the gimmick into a reality, giving audiences NEKOPARA - Catboys Paradise.    Neko Works announced on November 29 that it is developing a new title in the Nekopara game franchise titled Nekopara After La Vraie Famille. The company also revealed that the game franchise has sold more than 5 million copies worldwide.    Sekai Project released the Nekopara Vol. 1, Nekopara Vol. 2, and Nekopara Vol. 3 games and the Nekopara Vol. 0 fan disc in the U.S. The three games have since been ported to Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.    Neko Works' Nekopara Vol. 4: Neko to Patisserie no Noel game released in November 2020 on Steam, and then released on PS4 and Switch in December 2020.    Sekai Project previously ran a Kickstarter campaign in 2017 to fund an original video anime (OVA) based on the game franchise. The OVA launched on Steam in December 2017. The Kickstarter campaign also funded a 12-minute OVA of the prequel game as a stretch goal.    The game series inspired a television anime series that premiered in January 2020 and ran for 12 episodes. Funimation streamed the series as it aired with both English subtitles and an English dub.

News Neko Works Confirms Newly Announced Inupara: Dogs Paradise Game is 'Not a Joke'   posted on 2022-04-02 02:22 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo          Inupara stars six different dog girls each representing a popular breed.    Neko Works, the creators of the Nekopara visual novels, announced the Inupara: Dogs Paradise project with an opening song video and character profiles in multiple languages on Friday, April 1. The official YouTube channel began streaming the project's opening video on YouTube, which features the theme song  ""Inu no Ōta"" by singer Nanahira. The channel also pinned a comment stating in English that the video posted on April Fool's Day was ""Not a Joke.""      Inupara stars six different dog girls each representing a popular breed. The game's protagonist is a college student who shuns the usual social life in favor of spending quality time with his two dogs. One day, he wakes up to find his faithful pooches transformed into girls. The girls include Himawari the shiba inu, Tanpopo the pomeranian, Mimosa the chihuahua, Anemone the standard poodle, Botan the Pembroke Welsh corgi, and Calla the Siberian husky.                                             #INUPARA pic.twitter.com/xtxuYTKBhx— NEKO WORKs/NEKOPARA Official (@nekopara_pr) March 31, 2022     The team has previously announced a new game on April 1 as a joke, only to later turn the gimmick into a reality, giving audiences NEKOPARA - Catboys Paradise.    Neko Works announced on November 29 that it is developing a new title in the Nekopara game franchise titled Nekopara After La Vraie Famille. The company also revealed that the game franchise has sold more than 5 million copies worldwide.    Sekai Project released the Nekopara Vol. 1, Nekopara Vol. 2, and Nekopara Vol. 3 games and the Nekopara Vol. 0 fan disc in the U.S. The three games have since been ported to Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.    Neko Works' Nekopara Vol. 4: Neko to Patisserie no Noel game released in November 2020 on Steam, and then released on PS4 and Switch in December 2020.    Sekai Project previously ran a Kickstarter campaign in 2017 to fund an original video anime (OVA) based on the game franchise. The OVA launched on Steam in December 2017. The Kickstarter campaign also funded a 12-minute OVA of the prequel game as a stretch goal.    The game series inspired a television anime series that premiered in January 2020 and ran for 12 episodes. Funimation streamed the series as it aired with both English subtitles and an English dub.

One day, he wakes up to find his faithful pooches transformed into girls. The girls include Himawari the shiba inu, Tanpopo the pomeranian, Mimosa the chihuahua, Anemone the standard poodle, Botan the Pembroke Welsh corgi, and Calla the Siberian husky.                                             #INUPARA pic.twitter.com/xtxuYTKBhx— NEKO WORKs/NEKOPARA Official (@nekopara_pr) March 31, 2022     The team has previously announced a new game on April 1 as a joke, only to later turn the gimmick into a reality, giving audiences NEKOPARA - Catboys Paradise.    Neko Works announced on November 29 that it is developing a new title in the Nekopara game franchise titled Nekopara After La Vraie Famille. The company also revealed that the game franchise has sold more than 5 million copies worldwide.

News E3 Game Show Cancels 2022 Event   posted on 2022-04-01 04:12 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         E3 returns in 2023    The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) revealed to IGN on Thursday that it has canceled this year's E3 event, and there will not be an in-person or digital component. The ESA revealed that E3 will return in 2023 with ""a reinvigorated showcase"" ""live from Los Angeles."" The ESA plans to ""focus its resources"" on the 2023 show.    The ESA had announced the cancellation of the in-person E3 event in January due to ""health risks surrounding"" the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19). At the time, the trade association did not yet have plans for a digital/virtual event for E3.    IGN previously reported in January that it has confirmed from multiple sources ""tied to E3"" that the ESA had already made the decision to not hold an in-person event ""possibly as far back"" as fall 2021. The news site also confirmed with industry sources that companies had not heard about plans for any E3 event, whether physical or digital, even if such plans would have typically been revealed by that point in prior years. According to IGN, the Los Angeles Convention Center never put the E3 2022 show in its show calendar, despite shows in past years already being on the convention center's schedule over a year in advance.    The ESA held last year's E3 as a ""reimagined"" virtual event in June 2021, after canceling its in-person event in February earlier that year. The ESA canceled the physical E3 2020 event, and did not hold an online event that year.    The Los Angeles Convention Center also hosts Anime Expo, typically less than a month after E3. Anime Expo previously announced last year that it will return as a physical in-person event on July 1-4 this year, but it will require attendees to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test taken 72 hours prior to attending the event.

News E3 Game Show Cancels 2022 Event   posted on 2022-04-01 04:12 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         E3 returns in 2023    The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) revealed to IGN on Thursday that it has canceled this year's E3 event, and there will not be an in-person or digital component. The ESA revealed that E3 will return in 2023 with ""a reinvigorated showcase"" ""live from Los Angeles."" The ESA plans to ""focus its resources"" on the 2023 show.    The ESA had announced the cancellation of the in-person E3 event in January due to ""health risks surrounding"" the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19). At the time, the trade association did not yet have plans for a digital/virtual event for E3.    IGN previously reported in January that it has confirmed from multiple sources ""tied to E3"" that the ESA had already made the decision to not hold an in-person event ""possibly as far back"" as fall 2021. The news site also confirmed with industry sources that companies had not heard about plans for any E3 event, whether physical or digital, even if such plans would have typically been revealed by that point in prior years. According to IGN, the Los Angeles Convention Center never put the E3 2022 show in its show calendar, despite shows in past years already being on the convention center's schedule over a year in advance.    The ESA held last year's E3 as a ""reimagined"" virtual event in June 2021, after canceling its in-person event in February earlier that year. The ESA canceled the physical E3 2020 event, and did not hold an online event that year.    The Los Angeles Convention Center also hosts Anime Expo, typically less than a month after E3. Anime Expo previously announced last year that it will return as a physical in-person event on July 1-4 this year, but it will require attendees to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test taken 72 hours prior to attending the event.

News E3 Game Show Cancels 2022 Event   posted on 2022-04-01 04:12 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         E3 returns in 2023    The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) revealed to IGN on Thursday that it has canceled this year's E3 event, and there will not be an in-person or digital component. The ESA revealed that E3 will return in 2023 with ""a reinvigorated showcase"" ""live from Los Angeles."" The ESA plans to ""focus its resources"" on the 2023 show.    The ESA had announced the cancellation of the in-person E3 event in January due to ""health risks surrounding"" the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19). At the time, the trade association did not yet have plans for a digital/virtual event for E3.    IGN previously reported in January that it has confirmed from multiple sources ""tied to E3"" that the ESA had already made the decision to not hold an in-person event ""possibly as far back"" as fall 2021. The news site also confirmed with industry sources that companies had not heard about plans for any E3 event, whether physical or digital, even if such plans would have typically been revealed by that point in prior years. According to IGN, the Los Angeles Convention Center never put the E3 2022 show in its show calendar, despite shows in past years already being on the convention center's schedule over a year in advance.    The ESA held last year's E3 as a ""reimagined"" virtual event in June 2021, after canceling its in-person event in February earlier that year. The ESA canceled the physical E3 2020 event, and did not hold an online event that year.    The Los Angeles Convention Center also hosts Anime Expo, typically less than a month after E3. Anime Expo previously announced last year that it will return as a physical in-person event on July 1-4 this year, but it will require attendees to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test taken 72 hours prior to attending the event.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

My main concern is how the second season will handle the content, that was skipped over in the first season.  Since the first season was nothing more than a travelogue.   spoiler[They glossed over Verbergen and skipped the encounters with the Hoelscher Empire.]  It would be a shame if they excised these from the anime, since spoiler[ the blood bath in the Empire was a glorious moment in the light novel]      Back to top                  Cryten    Joined: 19 Jan 2019 		    Posts: 541       Posted: Fri Jan 21, 2022 6:13 am            Well I cant get as much fun dunking on the series anymore, since its actually competent now even if it doesnt stand out. Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I tolerate the light novel and manga enough but never watched the first season, so my impression is that they upped the edgelord aspects but toned down the sex and violence.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

Wished that the OP was a bit more exciting, but at least this OP was slightly better than the first season's horrible OP.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats. Catgirl Shizuku was adorable.      Back to top                  Fallout3Boi    Joined: 05 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 1       Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2022 5:14 am            My only thought? Remia's hair looks darker in the LN.   On another note though, at this point in season 2. Remia is only pretending to like Hajime as so not to hurt Myuu's feelings.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.  Those sorts of Easter eggs are always fun to catch when watching a show.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

My main concern is how the second season will handle the content, that was skipped over in the first season.  Since the first season was nothing more than a travelogue.   spoiler[They glossed over Verbergen and skipped the encounters with the Hoelscher Empire.]  It would be a shame if they excised these from the anime, since spoiler[ the blood bath in the Empire was a glorious moment in the light novel]      Back to top                  Cryten    Joined: 19 Jan 2019 		    Posts: 541       Posted: Fri Jan 21, 2022 6:13 am            Well I cant get as much fun dunking on the series anymore, since its actually competent now even if it doesnt stand out. Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I tolerate the light novel and manga enough but never watched the first season, so my impression is that they upped the edgelord aspects but toned down the sex and violence.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

Wished that the OP was a bit more exciting, but at least this OP was slightly better than the first season's horrible OP.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats. Catgirl Shizuku was adorable.      Back to top                  Fallout3Boi    Joined: 05 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 1       Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2022 5:14 am            My only thought? Remia's hair looks darker in the LN.   On another note though, at this point in season 2. Remia is only pretending to like Hajime as so not to hurt Myuu's feelings.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.  Those sorts of Easter eggs are always fun to catch when watching a show.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I tolerate the light novel and manga enough but never watched the first season, so my impression is that they upped the edgelord aspects but toned down the sex and violence.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

Wished that the OP was a bit more exciting, but at least this OP was slightly better than the first season's horrible OP.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats. Catgirl Shizuku was adorable.      Back to top                  Fallout3Boi    Joined: 05 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 1       Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2022 5:14 am            My only thought? Remia's hair looks darker in the LN.   On another note though, at this point in season 2. Remia is only pretending to like Hajime as so not to hurt Myuu's feelings.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

My main concern is how the second season will handle the content, that was skipped over in the first season.  Since the first season was nothing more than a travelogue.   spoiler[They glossed over Verbergen and skipped the encounters with the Hoelscher Empire.]  It would be a shame if they excised these from the anime, since spoiler[ the blood bath in the Empire was a glorious moment in the light novel]      Back to top                  Cryten    Joined: 19 Jan 2019 		    Posts: 541       Posted: Fri Jan 21, 2022 6:13 am            Well I cant get as much fun dunking on the series anymore, since its actually competent now even if it doesnt stand out. Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I tolerate the light novel and manga enough but never watched the first season, so my impression is that they upped the edgelord aspects but toned down the sex and violence.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats.

Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats. Catgirl Shizuku was adorable.      Back to top                  Fallout3Boi    Joined: 05 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 1       Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2022 5:14 am            My only thought? Remia's hair looks darker in the LN.   On another note though, at this point in season 2. Remia is only pretending to like Hajime as so not to hurt Myuu's feelings.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

Wished that the OP was a bit more exciting, but at least this OP was slightly better than the first season's horrible OP.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats. Catgirl Shizuku was adorable.      Back to top                  Fallout3Boi    Joined: 05 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 1       Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2022 5:14 am            My only thought? Remia's hair looks darker in the LN.   On another note though, at this point in season 2. Remia is only pretending to like Hajime as so not to hurt Myuu's feelings.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I tolerate the light novel and manga enough but never watched the first season, so my impression is that they upped the edgelord aspects but toned down the sex and violence.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

Wished that the OP was a bit more exciting, but at least this OP was slightly better than the first season's horrible OP.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats. Catgirl Shizuku was adorable.      Back to top                  Fallout3Boi    Joined: 05 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 1       Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2022 5:14 am            My only thought? Remia's hair looks darker in the LN.   On another note though, at this point in season 2. Remia is only pretending to like Hajime as so not to hurt Myuu's feelings.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

Strange and wonderful creatures reside in its depths, and it is full of precious relics that current humans are unable to make. The mysteries of the Abyss fascinate humans, and they head down to explore. The adventurers who venture into pit are known as ""Cave Raiders."" A little orphan girl named Riko lives in the town of Ōrth on the edge of the Abyss. Her dream is to become a Cave Raider like her mother and solve the mysteries of the cave system. One day, Riko starts exploring the caves and discovers a robot who resembles a human boy.    Tsukushi launched the manga on Takeshobo's Web Comic Gamma website in 2012. Seven Seas is publishing the manga in English.      Sources: Made in Abyss anime's website, Kadokawa Anime's Twitter account, Comic Natalie ",positive,en,{}
