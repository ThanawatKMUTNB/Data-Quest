News NIS America to Release Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief, La Pucelle: Ragnarok/Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure Games   posted on 2022-04-01 03:03 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Also: Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of DANA PS5 version    NIS America announced new games and releases during the New Games Plus Expo event on Thursday. The company revealed that it will release Acquire's Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief game, a remastered version of the original Kamiwaza, for Nintendo Switch, PS4, and PC in fall 2022.      The company describes the story:  Set during the Edo period of Japan, Kamiwaza stars Ebizo, a former thief who left his dangerous past life behind to care for a young girl named Suzuna. When Suzuna falls ill, Ebizo returns to the seedy underbelly of Mikado to afford her medicine the only he knows how: by taking up his mantle as a thief once again.  Acquire's Kamiwaza game launched for PlayStation 2 in Japan in 2006.    NIS America will release Prinny Presents NIS Classics Volume 3, a compilation featuring the La Pucelle: Ragnarok and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure games for Switch and PC this summer.      La Pucelle: Ragnarok is an updated port of the 2002 La Pucelle: Tactics game, and it launched in Japan only in 2009 for the PlayStation Portable. Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure launched for PlayStation in 1998 in Japan and in 2000 in North America. The game got a Nintendo DS version in 2008.    NIS America will release Nihon Falcon's Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of DANA action role-playing game for PlayStation 5 in fall 2022.      Nihon Falcom released the game for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in Japan in May 2017, and NIS America released the game for PS4 and PS Vita in North America and Europe in September 2017. NIS America released the game on PC in April 2018 after a delay from its previous January 2018 release date. The company then released the Nintendo Switch version of the game in North America and Europe in June 2018.    NIS America also revealed that it will release the Fallen Legion: Rise to Glory / Fallen Legion Revenants game compilation for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC this summer.

News NIS America to Release Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief, La Pucelle: Ragnarok/Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure Games   posted on 2022-04-01 03:03 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Also: Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of DANA PS5 version    NIS America announced new games and releases during the New Games Plus Expo event on Thursday. The company revealed that it will release Acquire's Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief game, a remastered version of the original Kamiwaza, for Nintendo Switch, PS4, and PC in fall 2022.      The company describes the story:  Set during the Edo period of Japan, Kamiwaza stars Ebizo, a former thief who left his dangerous past life behind to care for a young girl named Suzuna. When Suzuna falls ill, Ebizo returns to the seedy underbelly of Mikado to afford her medicine the only he knows how: by taking up his mantle as a thief once again.  Acquire's Kamiwaza game launched for PlayStation 2 in Japan in 2006.    NIS America will release Prinny Presents NIS Classics Volume 3, a compilation featuring the La Pucelle: Ragnarok and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure games for Switch and PC this summer.      La Pucelle: Ragnarok is an updated port of the 2002 La Pucelle: Tactics game, and it launched in Japan only in 2009 for the PlayStation Portable. Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure launched for PlayStation in 1998 in Japan and in 2000 in North America. The game got a Nintendo DS version in 2008.    NIS America will release Nihon Falcon's Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of DANA action role-playing game for PlayStation 5 in fall 2022.      Nihon Falcom released the game for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in Japan in May 2017, and NIS America released the game for PS4 and PS Vita in North America and Europe in September 2017. NIS America released the game on PC in April 2018 after a delay from its previous January 2018 release date. The company then released the Nintendo Switch version of the game in North America and Europe in June 2018.    NIS America also revealed that it will release the Fallen Legion: Rise to Glory / Fallen Legion Revenants game compilation for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC this summer.

The weekly anime premiered on the NHK-E channel in April 2021.    The manga follows the daily life of Kotetsu-kun, who aspires to be an astronaut, and friends at the Animal Space Academy as they all pursue their dreams.    Hazumu Sakuta (Ōya-san to Boku, How Clumsy you are, Miss Ueno, Neko no Dayan) is directing the anime at Fanworks (Aggretsuko, Sumikko Gurashi: Tobidasu Ehon to Himitsu no Ko). Yoichi Kato (Yo-kai Watch, Space Brothers) is writing the scripts.    Nishimura launched the manga on August 6, 2019, just after the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing, and has since posted a chapter every other Monday for free.

Tribe Nine Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Tribe Nine ?                     Community score: 3.6            Time to get ready to play ball, which is coincidentally the title of Tribe Nine's grand slam of a finale (that is, “PLAY BALL” in all caps) to what I can only assume will be a one cour project as, spoiler alert: it has very little baseball, actually. But there's lots and lots of feelings.    Ojiro goes full mask off (as in, he literally takes off his mask) this week, taking on the Minato Tribe in a face-to-face battle that's full of twists and turns, including a good bit of betrayal. I love a last-minute heel turn (with GUNS!), even if it's crammed into twenty-four minutes of not the best paced scripting. But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?    There is so much crammed into this episode: there's flashbacks and XB fights (and even more almost XB fights) and character growth and character deconstruction. It's all a lot, and it's not necessarily well-structured. It is fairly interesting, but maybe, in another series it would be well-executed and not feel like Tribe Nine was trying to tie up a bunch of loose ends. It ultimately feels messy, and when the resolution comes it's expected, which is really all I can say.    And since we're here, let's talk about resolutions.    I can easily say I'll be leaving the series with a solid sense of closure and a bit of optimism, which is nice, but unexpected. I genuinely thought I'd be leaving with some sort of “now go play the mobile game” bait, but instead we get an ending that feels about as good as you can expect from a show that's gone through some very high highs and extremely low lows like Tribe Nine has, cliffhangers included.    And goodness me, has this show gone through it over the past few weeks.    But where the show lands -and actually sticks the landing- is on the notion of fun. Part of why XB is so engaging for the late Shun Kamiya, and now, for Haru, is because it's a game. XB thrives when that's at the core: when it becomes a knock down, drag out battle, the game loses it's enjoyment. And it's actually this return to fun by Haru -who literally throws hands this episode- that actually kind of had me smiling in the end because say what you will, this show stays the course with its overall message, roiling the world of XB and Neo Tokyo by Game Over-ing some characters. (Or are they alive? Here's the thing, I genuinely don't know.)    Tribe Nine is a series that I don't regret spending time with, if only because of my insatiable desire to devour everything Kazutaka Kodaka lays his hands on. I just kind of can't help myself: every since I played Danganronpa in grad school, I've been very into everything he makes. Tribe Nine is the fast food of anime. It is is the 7-11 pizza slice of the animation world. Will it do in a pinch? Yeah, of course, but is it exactly what I wanted?    No, not at all.    There was a lot of mixed feelings as the credits rolled: I tried to reflect on what drew me to this show outside of my desire to kin my personality into every single Danganronpa character. Thinking back, it was a desire to see  a sports anime that was fun, and to a degree Tribe Nine was, at least initially. That said, I know there was an audience for this series, and I really hope that if you're that audience, you enjoyed it. Truth be told, that's always my wish for shows that I'm reviewing, whether or not I like them in the end: I hope that they brought enjoyment to as many people as possible. I'm a bit on both sides of the fence with my enjoyment, but honestly I can safely conclude this review saying that this anime is perfectly okay, and that's okay in and of itself. Every season needs its C-minus grade anime, and Tribe Nine?    Well, it's a grand slam in that category.    Rating:              because this was so close to four stars, but just never got there       Tribe Nine is currently streaming on Funimation.

Tribe Nine Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Tribe Nine ?                     Community score: 3.6            Time to get ready to play ball, which is coincidentally the title of Tribe Nine's grand slam of a finale (that is, “PLAY BALL” in all caps) to what I can only assume will be a one cour project as, spoiler alert: it has very little baseball, actually. But there's lots and lots of feelings.    Ojiro goes full mask off (as in, he literally takes off his mask) this week, taking on the Minato Tribe in a face-to-face battle that's full of twists and turns, including a good bit of betrayal. I love a last-minute heel turn (with GUNS!), even if it's crammed into twenty-four minutes of not the best paced scripting. But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?    There is so much crammed into this episode: there's flashbacks and XB fights (and even more almost XB fights) and character growth and character deconstruction. It's all a lot, and it's not necessarily well-structured. It is fairly interesting, but maybe, in another series it would be well-executed and not feel like Tribe Nine was trying to tie up a bunch of loose ends. It ultimately feels messy, and when the resolution comes it's expected, which is really all I can say.    And since we're here, let's talk about resolutions.    I can easily say I'll be leaving the series with a solid sense of closure and a bit of optimism, which is nice, but unexpected. I genuinely thought I'd be leaving with some sort of “now go play the mobile game” bait, but instead we get an ending that feels about as good as you can expect from a show that's gone through some very high highs and extremely low lows like Tribe Nine has, cliffhangers included.    And goodness me, has this show gone through it over the past few weeks.    But where the show lands -and actually sticks the landing- is on the notion of fun. Part of why XB is so engaging for the late Shun Kamiya, and now, for Haru, is because it's a game. XB thrives when that's at the core: when it becomes a knock down, drag out battle, the game loses it's enjoyment. And it's actually this return to fun by Haru -who literally throws hands this episode- that actually kind of had me smiling in the end because say what you will, this show stays the course with its overall message, roiling the world of XB and Neo Tokyo by Game Over-ing some characters. (Or are they alive? Here's the thing, I genuinely don't know.)    Tribe Nine is a series that I don't regret spending time with, if only because of my insatiable desire to devour everything Kazutaka Kodaka lays his hands on. I just kind of can't help myself: every since I played Danganronpa in grad school, I've been very into everything he makes. Tribe Nine is the fast food of anime. It is is the 7-11 pizza slice of the animation world. Will it do in a pinch? Yeah, of course, but is it exactly what I wanted?    No, not at all.    There was a lot of mixed feelings as the credits rolled: I tried to reflect on what drew me to this show outside of my desire to kin my personality into every single Danganronpa character. Thinking back, it was a desire to see  a sports anime that was fun, and to a degree Tribe Nine was, at least initially. That said, I know there was an audience for this series, and I really hope that if you're that audience, you enjoyed it. Truth be told, that's always my wish for shows that I'm reviewing, whether or not I like them in the end: I hope that they brought enjoyment to as many people as possible. I'm a bit on both sides of the fence with my enjoyment, but honestly I can safely conclude this review saying that this anime is perfectly okay, and that's okay in and of itself. Every season needs its C-minus grade anime, and Tribe Nine?    Well, it's a grand slam in that category.    Rating:              because this was so close to four stars, but just never got there       Tribe Nine is currently streaming on Funimation.

Tribe Nine Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Tribe Nine ?                     Community score: 3.6            Time to get ready to play ball, which is coincidentally the title of Tribe Nine's grand slam of a finale (that is, “PLAY BALL” in all caps) to what I can only assume will be a one cour project as, spoiler alert: it has very little baseball, actually. But there's lots and lots of feelings.    Ojiro goes full mask off (as in, he literally takes off his mask) this week, taking on the Minato Tribe in a face-to-face battle that's full of twists and turns, including a good bit of betrayal. I love a last-minute heel turn (with GUNS!), even if it's crammed into twenty-four minutes of not the best paced scripting. But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?    There is so much crammed into this episode: there's flashbacks and XB fights (and even more almost XB fights) and character growth and character deconstruction. It's all a lot, and it's not necessarily well-structured. It is fairly interesting, but maybe, in another series it would be well-executed and not feel like Tribe Nine was trying to tie up a bunch of loose ends. It ultimately feels messy, and when the resolution comes it's expected, which is really all I can say.    And since we're here, let's talk about resolutions.    I can easily say I'll be leaving the series with a solid sense of closure and a bit of optimism, which is nice, but unexpected. I genuinely thought I'd be leaving with some sort of “now go play the mobile game” bait, but instead we get an ending that feels about as good as you can expect from a show that's gone through some very high highs and extremely low lows like Tribe Nine has, cliffhangers included.    And goodness me, has this show gone through it over the past few weeks.    But where the show lands -and actually sticks the landing- is on the notion of fun. Part of why XB is so engaging for the late Shun Kamiya, and now, for Haru, is because it's a game. XB thrives when that's at the core: when it becomes a knock down, drag out battle, the game loses it's enjoyment. And it's actually this return to fun by Haru -who literally throws hands this episode- that actually kind of had me smiling in the end because say what you will, this show stays the course with its overall message, roiling the world of XB and Neo Tokyo by Game Over-ing some characters. (Or are they alive? Here's the thing, I genuinely don't know.)    Tribe Nine is a series that I don't regret spending time with, if only because of my insatiable desire to devour everything Kazutaka Kodaka lays his hands on. I just kind of can't help myself: every since I played Danganronpa in grad school, I've been very into everything he makes. Tribe Nine is the fast food of anime. It is is the 7-11 pizza slice of the animation world. Will it do in a pinch? Yeah, of course, but is it exactly what I wanted?    No, not at all.    There was a lot of mixed feelings as the credits rolled: I tried to reflect on what drew me to this show outside of my desire to kin my personality into every single Danganronpa character. Thinking back, it was a desire to see  a sports anime that was fun, and to a degree Tribe Nine was, at least initially. That said, I know there was an audience for this series, and I really hope that if you're that audience, you enjoyed it. Truth be told, that's always my wish for shows that I'm reviewing, whether or not I like them in the end: I hope that they brought enjoyment to as many people as possible. I'm a bit on both sides of the fence with my enjoyment, but honestly I can safely conclude this review saying that this anime is perfectly okay, and that's okay in and of itself. Every season needs its C-minus grade anime, and Tribe Nine?    Well, it's a grand slam in that category.    Rating:              because this was so close to four stars, but just never got there       Tribe Nine is currently streaming on Funimation.

Tribe Nine Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Tribe Nine ?                     Community score: 3.6            Time to get ready to play ball, which is coincidentally the title of Tribe Nine's grand slam of a finale (that is, “PLAY BALL” in all caps) to what I can only assume will be a one cour project as, spoiler alert: it has very little baseball, actually. But there's lots and lots of feelings.    Ojiro goes full mask off (as in, he literally takes off his mask) this week, taking on the Minato Tribe in a face-to-face battle that's full of twists and turns, including a good bit of betrayal. I love a last-minute heel turn (with GUNS!), even if it's crammed into twenty-four minutes of not the best paced scripting. But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?    There is so much crammed into this episode: there's flashbacks and XB fights (and even more almost XB fights) and character growth and character deconstruction. It's all a lot, and it's not necessarily well-structured. It is fairly interesting, but maybe, in another series it would be well-executed and not feel like Tribe Nine was trying to tie up a bunch of loose ends. It ultimately feels messy, and when the resolution comes it's expected, which is really all I can say.    And since we're here, let's talk about resolutions.    I can easily say I'll be leaving the series with a solid sense of closure and a bit of optimism, which is nice, but unexpected. I genuinely thought I'd be leaving with some sort of “now go play the mobile game” bait, but instead we get an ending that feels about as good as you can expect from a show that's gone through some very high highs and extremely low lows like Tribe Nine has, cliffhangers included.    And goodness me, has this show gone through it over the past few weeks.    But where the show lands -and actually sticks the landing- is on the notion of fun. Part of why XB is so engaging for the late Shun Kamiya, and now, for Haru, is because it's a game. XB thrives when that's at the core: when it becomes a knock down, drag out battle, the game loses it's enjoyment. And it's actually this return to fun by Haru -who literally throws hands this episode- that actually kind of had me smiling in the end because say what you will, this show stays the course with its overall message, roiling the world of XB and Neo Tokyo by Game Over-ing some characters. (Or are they alive? Here's the thing, I genuinely don't know.)    Tribe Nine is a series that I don't regret spending time with, if only because of my insatiable desire to devour everything Kazutaka Kodaka lays his hands on. I just kind of can't help myself: every since I played Danganronpa in grad school, I've been very into everything he makes. Tribe Nine is the fast food of anime. It is is the 7-11 pizza slice of the animation world. Will it do in a pinch? Yeah, of course, but is it exactly what I wanted?    No, not at all.    There was a lot of mixed feelings as the credits rolled: I tried to reflect on what drew me to this show outside of my desire to kin my personality into every single Danganronpa character. Thinking back, it was a desire to see  a sports anime that was fun, and to a degree Tribe Nine was, at least initially. That said, I know there was an audience for this series, and I really hope that if you're that audience, you enjoyed it. Truth be told, that's always my wish for shows that I'm reviewing, whether or not I like them in the end: I hope that they brought enjoyment to as many people as possible. I'm a bit on both sides of the fence with my enjoyment, but honestly I can safely conclude this review saying that this anime is perfectly okay, and that's okay in and of itself. Every season needs its C-minus grade anime, and Tribe Nine?    Well, it's a grand slam in that category.    Rating:              because this was so close to four stars, but just never got there       Tribe Nine is currently streaming on Funimation.

Community score: 3.6            Time to get ready to play ball, which is coincidentally the title of Tribe Nine's grand slam of a finale (that is, “PLAY BALL” in all caps) to what I can only assume will be a one cour project as, spoiler alert: it has very little baseball, actually. But there's lots and lots of feelings.    Ojiro goes full mask off (as in, he literally takes off his mask) this week, taking on the Minato Tribe in a face-to-face battle that's full of twists and turns, including a good bit of betrayal. I love a last-minute heel turn (with GUNS!), even if it's crammed into twenty-four minutes of not the best paced scripting. But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?    There is so much crammed into this episode: there's flashbacks and XB fights (and even more almost XB fights) and character growth and character deconstruction. It's all a lot, and it's not necessarily well-structured. It is fairly interesting, but maybe, in another series it would be well-executed and not feel like Tribe Nine was trying to tie up a bunch of loose ends. It ultimately feels messy, and when the resolution comes it's expected, which is really all I can say.    And since we're here, let's talk about resolutions.    I can easily say I'll be leaving the series with a solid sense of closure and a bit of optimism, which is nice, but unexpected. I genuinely thought I'd be leaving with some sort of “now go play the mobile game” bait, but instead we get an ending that feels about as good as you can expect from a show that's gone through some very high highs and extremely low lows like Tribe Nine has, cliffhangers included.    And goodness me, has this show gone through it over the past few weeks.    But where the show lands -and actually sticks the landing- is on the notion of fun. Part of why XB is so engaging for the late Shun Kamiya, and now, for Haru, is because it's a game. XB thrives when that's at the core: when it becomes a knock down, drag out battle, the game loses it's enjoyment. And it's actually this return to fun by Haru -who literally throws hands this episode- that actually kind of had me smiling in the end because say what you will, this show stays the course with its overall message, roiling the world of XB and Neo Tokyo by Game Over-ing some characters. (Or are they alive? Here's the thing, I genuinely don't know.)    Tribe Nine is a series that I don't regret spending time with, if only because of my insatiable desire to devour everything Kazutaka Kodaka lays his hands on. I just kind of can't help myself: every since I played Danganronpa in grad school, I've been very into everything he makes. Tribe Nine is the fast food of anime. It is is the 7-11 pizza slice of the animation world. Will it do in a pinch? Yeah, of course, but is it exactly what I wanted?    No, not at all.    There was a lot of mixed feelings as the credits rolled: I tried to reflect on what drew me to this show outside of my desire to kin my personality into every single Danganronpa character. Thinking back, it was a desire to see  a sports anime that was fun, and to a degree Tribe Nine was, at least initially. That said, I know there was an audience for this series, and I really hope that if you're that audience, you enjoyed it. Truth be told, that's always my wish for shows that I'm reviewing, whether or not I like them in the end: I hope that they brought enjoyment to as many people as possible. I'm a bit on both sides of the fence with my enjoyment, but honestly I can safely conclude this review saying that this anime is perfectly okay, and that's okay in and of itself. Every season needs its C-minus grade anime, and Tribe Nine?    Well, it's a grand slam in that category.

Interest Masamune-kun's Revenge Anime Jokingly Announces ""Season 3"" For April Fool's   posted on 2022-04-01 12:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Even though there isn't even a season 2 yet...    The Masamune-kun's Revenge anime released an April Fool's comic strip on Friday jokingly announcing a ""season 3."" In the illustration, Yoshino Koiwai is shown reaching for a sign reading ""Season 3 production confirmed,"" while Aki Adagaki points out: ""What are you doing? Before you can announce season 3, you have to announce season 2! Take that down!""     The image hints at a possible season 2, given that there is a second sign underneath the ""season 3"" one.    Hazuki Takeoka and Tiv's Masamune-kun's Revenge (Masamune-kun no Revenge) manga inspired a television anime adaptation that premiered in January 2017. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Funimation streamed an English dub.    The manga launched the series in Ichijinsha's Monthly Comic Rex magazine in 2012, and ended in June 2018. An original anime disc (OAD) that Ichijinsha bundled with the manga's 10th volume also tells an ""after story"" for the manga. The volume shipped in July 2018.
