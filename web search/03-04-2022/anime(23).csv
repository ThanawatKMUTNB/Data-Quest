News Joshikōsei ni Korosaretai Live-Action Film's New Clip Features Kei Tanaka, Sara Minami   posted on 2022-04-01 20:15 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Film based on Usamaru Furuya's manga opened in Japan on Friday    Nikkatsu began streaming a fourth clip from the live-action film of Usamaru Furuya's Joshikōsei ni Korosaretai (I Want to be Killed by a High School Girl) suspense manga on Thursday. The clip shows the protagonist Haruto Higashiyama (played by Kei Tanaka) and one of his students Maho (played by Sara Minami) cleaning up a student club room together after an earthquake, when Maho fixes Haruto's crooked tie for him.      Joshikōsei ni Korosaretai follows a man who becomes a high school teacher in his nine-year plan to be killed by a beautiful girl — even though he doesn't particularly want to die.    Kei Tanaka (.hack//The Movie, live-action Library Wars, Tokyo University Story) stars in the film as protagonist Haruto Higashiyama. Other cast members include Sara Minami as Maho, Yūmi Kawai as Aoi, Riko as Kyōko, Mizuki Kayashima as Aika, Kanata Hosoda, Natsu Katō, Nonoka Kubo, and Kin Takao. Yuko Oshima plays Satsuki Fukagawa, a psychologist and the former lover of protagonist Haruto Higashiyama.    Hideo Jōjō (Dangerous Drugs of Sex/Sei no Gekiyaku, On the Edge of Their Seats/Alps Stand no Hashi no Hō) is directing and writing the film. Alisa is performing the film's image song ""tell me i'm broken.""    Yutaka Tanito is developing and producing the film. The company Dub is producing the film, and Nikkatsu is developing and distributing.    The film opened in Japan on Friday.    Furuya (Lychee Light Club, No Longer Human, Amane Gymnasium, 51 Ways to Save Her, Genkaku Picasso) began the manga in Shinchosha's quarterly magazine Go Go Bunch  in 2013, and Shinchosha shipped the first compiled volume in February 2015. He ended the manga in July 2016, and the second and final volume shipped thereafter.

News Joshikōsei ni Korosaretai Live-Action Film's New Clip Features Kei Tanaka, Sara Minami   posted on 2022-04-01 20:15 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Film based on Usamaru Furuya's manga opened in Japan on Friday    Nikkatsu began streaming a fourth clip from the live-action film of Usamaru Furuya's Joshikōsei ni Korosaretai (I Want to be Killed by a High School Girl) suspense manga on Thursday. The clip shows the protagonist Haruto Higashiyama (played by Kei Tanaka) and one of his students Maho (played by Sara Minami) cleaning up a student club room together after an earthquake, when Maho fixes Haruto's crooked tie for him.      Joshikōsei ni Korosaretai follows a man who becomes a high school teacher in his nine-year plan to be killed by a beautiful girl — even though he doesn't particularly want to die.    Kei Tanaka (.hack//The Movie, live-action Library Wars, Tokyo University Story) stars in the film as protagonist Haruto Higashiyama. Other cast members include Sara Minami as Maho, Yūmi Kawai as Aoi, Riko as Kyōko, Mizuki Kayashima as Aika, Kanata Hosoda, Natsu Katō, Nonoka Kubo, and Kin Takao. Yuko Oshima plays Satsuki Fukagawa, a psychologist and the former lover of protagonist Haruto Higashiyama.    Hideo Jōjō (Dangerous Drugs of Sex/Sei no Gekiyaku, On the Edge of Their Seats/Alps Stand no Hashi no Hō) is directing and writing the film. Alisa is performing the film's image song ""tell me i'm broken.""    Yutaka Tanito is developing and producing the film. The company Dub is producing the film, and Nikkatsu is developing and distributing.    The film opened in Japan on Friday.    Furuya (Lychee Light Club, No Longer Human, Amane Gymnasium, 51 Ways to Save Her, Genkaku Picasso) began the manga in Shinchosha's quarterly magazine Go Go Bunch  in 2013, and Shinchosha shipped the first compiled volume in February 2015. He ended the manga in July 2016, and the second and final volume shipped thereafter.

News Joshikōsei ni Korosaretai Live-Action Film's New Clip Features Kei Tanaka, Sara Minami   posted on 2022-04-01 20:15 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Film based on Usamaru Furuya's manga opened in Japan on Friday    Nikkatsu began streaming a fourth clip from the live-action film of Usamaru Furuya's Joshikōsei ni Korosaretai (I Want to be Killed by a High School Girl) suspense manga on Thursday. The clip shows the protagonist Haruto Higashiyama (played by Kei Tanaka) and one of his students Maho (played by Sara Minami) cleaning up a student club room together after an earthquake, when Maho fixes Haruto's crooked tie for him.      Joshikōsei ni Korosaretai follows a man who becomes a high school teacher in his nine-year plan to be killed by a beautiful girl — even though he doesn't particularly want to die.    Kei Tanaka (.hack//The Movie, live-action Library Wars, Tokyo University Story) stars in the film as protagonist Haruto Higashiyama. Other cast members include Sara Minami as Maho, Yūmi Kawai as Aoi, Riko as Kyōko, Mizuki Kayashima as Aika, Kanata Hosoda, Natsu Katō, Nonoka Kubo, and Kin Takao. Yuko Oshima plays Satsuki Fukagawa, a psychologist and the former lover of protagonist Haruto Higashiyama.    Hideo Jōjō (Dangerous Drugs of Sex/Sei no Gekiyaku, On the Edge of Their Seats/Alps Stand no Hashi no Hō) is directing and writing the film. Alisa is performing the film's image song ""tell me i'm broken.""    Yutaka Tanito is developing and producing the film. The company Dub is producing the film, and Nikkatsu is developing and distributing.    The film opened in Japan on Friday.    Furuya (Lychee Light Club, No Longer Human, Amane Gymnasium, 51 Ways to Save Her, Genkaku Picasso) began the manga in Shinchosha's quarterly magazine Go Go Bunch  in 2013, and Shinchosha shipped the first compiled volume in February 2015.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Thermae Romae Novae   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Thermae Romae Novae (ONA) ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.    All in all, I don't know if it's my cup of tea but it certainly wasn't bad.     discuss this in the forum (38 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Thermae Romae Novae   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Thermae Romae Novae (ONA) ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.    All in all, I don't know if it's my cup of tea but it certainly wasn't bad.     discuss this in the forum (38 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Thermae Romae Novae   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Thermae Romae Novae (ONA) ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.    All in all, I don't know if it's my cup of tea but it certainly wasn't bad.     discuss this in the forum (38 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.    All in all, I don't know if it's my cup of tea but it certainly wasn't bad.     discuss this in the forum (38 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.    All in all, I don't know if it's my cup of tea but it certainly wasn't bad.     discuss this in the forum (38 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 3.0              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner.

Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.

Community score: 3.0              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 12  by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.8            Now we approach the winter of our discontent, which is to say that this episode brings us out of Henry VI Part Three and into Richard III in terms of source material. That seems fitting for the finale of the first part of the series as it marks an emotional turning point for Richard. He has only recently realized that he loves Henry, only to find out that his love is in fact the man he blames for York's death (even if it was actually Margaret), that Anne has betrayed him, and that his Edward was actually the prince, all in almost the same breath. It's a lot to handle even if you aren't as emotionally unstable as Richard is after years of his mother's emotional abuse, and the return of his abuser into his life certainly isn't going to help him to cope with anything.    And so he turns to violence, which has become his go-to method for coping with things he can't actually handle. We've seen evidence of that from early episodes; while Richard is more than capable of emotional manipulation and other forms of machination, the Wars of the Roses have mostly offered him a bloody way out of his perceived helplessness. Even if he hadn't experienced some sort of psychotic break after the death of his father (which is debatable) he's not in a great position of mental health, and when we saw him run Prince Edward through, it looked an awful lot like the frustration of his miserable situation simply overwhelming him. He was lashing out in response to emotional pain, and that's what he does again when he visits Henry in the Tower – when Henry begins repeating Cecily's words about how cursed and evil Richard is and how the world would rue the day of his birth, Richard can't handle it. He's once again hearing hatred spewed from a mouth that should have spoken of love (and in this case actually did), and the only thing that he can think to do in the moment is to just make it stop.    What makes this particularly awful is that kissing Richard and moving their relationship from the (perception of) platonic to romantic is what causes Henry to begin repeating Cecily in the first place. Henry was traumatized by his mother Queen Catherine's affair, which in Requiem of the Rose King caused him to instead embrace as sexless a life as he could manage, believing it to be more pure and honest than an act that made his mother say such awful things. But when he kisses Richard, he's forced to accept that he also has those lusts within him, something he's been denying for a very long time, and all of that old trauma comes rushing back. His words are less an indictment of Richard and more an agony directed at himself for breaking from his beliefs. Unfortunately for him, Richard has his own trauma, and hearing the man he loves repeat his mother's imprecations is more than he can handle, especially right now.    It is, however, worth remembering what Catesby said to him before he forced his way into the Tower – that he had prepared a corpse to look like Henry. We do see Richard stab Henry and Henry fall over, but we never specifically see Henry's dead body, and when Anne is weeping by the red rose-draped coffin in the forest, Richard is quick to tell her that this is not Henry. Anne interprets that as Henry's mortal shell – that which made him “Henry” – having left, but strictly speaking, that may not be what Richard means. As well, I could see the series playing with the fact that Henry VI was interred in Chertsey Abbey but later moved to Windsor Castle's St. George's Chapel by Richard III as a means to back up the potential idea of Henry only being mostly dead.    In any event, the title for this episode tells things truly: the Richard we've known thus far may well be dead, or at least on his way towards dying. Anne may be able to help salvage what's left of his gentleness (even if she does appear to be in the early stages of pregnancy), but right now that doesn't feel all that likely. It seems instead that he's beginning to embody some of the last words he speaks to Henry in Henry VI Part Three: “And this word 'love,' which greybeards call divine,/ Be resident in men like one another/ And not in me: I am myself alone.”    “I am myself alone.” Does that mean that he is no one but himself? Or that he feels himself alone and friendless, adrift in an unwelcoming world? Either could be true. Time will show us which it is.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 12  by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.8            Now we approach the winter of our discontent, which is to say that this episode brings us out of Henry VI Part Three and into Richard III in terms of source material. That seems fitting for the finale of the first part of the series as it marks an emotional turning point for Richard. He has only recently realized that he loves Henry, only to find out that his love is in fact the man he blames for York's death (even if it was actually Margaret), that Anne has betrayed him, and that his Edward was actually the prince, all in almost the same breath. It's a lot to handle even if you aren't as emotionally unstable as Richard is after years of his mother's emotional abuse, and the return of his abuser into his life certainly isn't going to help him to cope with anything.    And so he turns to violence, which has become his go-to method for coping with things he can't actually handle. We've seen evidence of that from early episodes; while Richard is more than capable of emotional manipulation and other forms of machination, the Wars of the Roses have mostly offered him a bloody way out of his perceived helplessness. Even if he hadn't experienced some sort of psychotic break after the death of his father (which is debatable) he's not in a great position of mental health, and when we saw him run Prince Edward through, it looked an awful lot like the frustration of his miserable situation simply overwhelming him. He was lashing out in response to emotional pain, and that's what he does again when he visits Henry in the Tower – when Henry begins repeating Cecily's words about how cursed and evil Richard is and how the world would rue the day of his birth, Richard can't handle it. He's once again hearing hatred spewed from a mouth that should have spoken of love (and in this case actually did), and the only thing that he can think to do in the moment is to just make it stop.    What makes this particularly awful is that kissing Richard and moving their relationship from the (perception of) platonic to romantic is what causes Henry to begin repeating Cecily in the first place. Henry was traumatized by his mother Queen Catherine's affair, which in Requiem of the Rose King caused him to instead embrace as sexless a life as he could manage, believing it to be more pure and honest than an act that made his mother say such awful things. But when he kisses Richard, he's forced to accept that he also has those lusts within him, something he's been denying for a very long time, and all of that old trauma comes rushing back. His words are less an indictment of Richard and more an agony directed at himself for breaking from his beliefs. Unfortunately for him, Richard has his own trauma, and hearing the man he loves repeat his mother's imprecations is more than he can handle, especially right now.    It is, however, worth remembering what Catesby said to him before he forced his way into the Tower – that he had prepared a corpse to look like Henry. We do see Richard stab Henry and Henry fall over, but we never specifically see Henry's dead body, and when Anne is weeping by the red rose-draped coffin in the forest, Richard is quick to tell her that this is not Henry. Anne interprets that as Henry's mortal shell – that which made him “Henry” – having left, but strictly speaking, that may not be what Richard means. As well, I could see the series playing with the fact that Henry VI was interred in Chertsey Abbey but later moved to Windsor Castle's St. George's Chapel by Richard III as a means to back up the potential idea of Henry only being mostly dead.    In any event, the title for this episode tells things truly: the Richard we've known thus far may well be dead, or at least on his way towards dying. Anne may be able to help salvage what's left of his gentleness (even if she does appear to be in the early stages of pregnancy), but right now that doesn't feel all that likely. It seems instead that he's beginning to embody some of the last words he speaks to Henry in Henry VI Part Three: “And this word 'love,' which greybeards call divine,/ Be resident in men like one another/ And not in me: I am myself alone.”    “I am myself alone.” Does that mean that he is no one but himself? Or that he feels himself alone and friendless, adrift in an unwelcoming world? Either could be true. Time will show us which it is.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 12  by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.8            Now we approach the winter of our discontent, which is to say that this episode brings us out of Henry VI Part Three and into Richard III in terms of source material. That seems fitting for the finale of the first part of the series as it marks an emotional turning point for Richard. He has only recently realized that he loves Henry, only to find out that his love is in fact the man he blames for York's death (even if it was actually Margaret), that Anne has betrayed him, and that his Edward was actually the prince, all in almost the same breath. It's a lot to handle even if you aren't as emotionally unstable as Richard is after years of his mother's emotional abuse, and the return of his abuser into his life certainly isn't going to help him to cope with anything.    And so he turns to violence, which has become his go-to method for coping with things he can't actually handle. We've seen evidence of that from early episodes; while Richard is more than capable of emotional manipulation and other forms of machination, the Wars of the Roses have mostly offered him a bloody way out of his perceived helplessness. Even if he hadn't experienced some sort of psychotic break after the death of his father (which is debatable) he's not in a great position of mental health, and when we saw him run Prince Edward through, it looked an awful lot like the frustration of his miserable situation simply overwhelming him. He was lashing out in response to emotional pain, and that's what he does again when he visits Henry in the Tower – when Henry begins repeating Cecily's words about how cursed and evil Richard is and how the world would rue the day of his birth, Richard can't handle it. He's once again hearing hatred spewed from a mouth that should have spoken of love (and in this case actually did), and the only thing that he can think to do in the moment is to just make it stop.    What makes this particularly awful is that kissing Richard and moving their relationship from the (perception of) platonic to romantic is what causes Henry to begin repeating Cecily in the first place. Henry was traumatized by his mother Queen Catherine's affair, which in Requiem of the Rose King caused him to instead embrace as sexless a life as he could manage, believing it to be more pure and honest than an act that made his mother say such awful things. But when he kisses Richard, he's forced to accept that he also has those lusts within him, something he's been denying for a very long time, and all of that old trauma comes rushing back. His words are less an indictment of Richard and more an agony directed at himself for breaking from his beliefs. Unfortunately for him, Richard has his own trauma, and hearing the man he loves repeat his mother's imprecations is more than he can handle, especially right now.    It is, however, worth remembering what Catesby said to him before he forced his way into the Tower – that he had prepared a corpse to look like Henry. We do see Richard stab Henry and Henry fall over, but we never specifically see Henry's dead body, and when Anne is weeping by the red rose-draped coffin in the forest, Richard is quick to tell her that this is not Henry. Anne interprets that as Henry's mortal shell – that which made him “Henry” – having left, but strictly speaking, that may not be what Richard means. As well, I could see the series playing with the fact that Henry VI was interred in Chertsey Abbey but later moved to Windsor Castle's St. George's Chapel by Richard III as a means to back up the potential idea of Henry only being mostly dead.    In any event, the title for this episode tells things truly: the Richard we've known thus far may well be dead, or at least on his way towards dying. Anne may be able to help salvage what's left of his gentleness (even if she does appear to be in the early stages of pregnancy), but right now that doesn't feel all that likely. It seems instead that he's beginning to embody some of the last words he speaks to Henry in Henry VI Part Three: “And this word 'love,' which greybeards call divine,/ Be resident in men like one another/ And not in me: I am myself alone.”    “I am myself alone.” Does that mean that he is no one but himself? Or that he feels himself alone and friendless, adrift in an unwelcoming world? Either could be true. Time will show us which it is.

It's essentially a dog version of NekoPara, but with significantly more story, drama, and worldbuilding. It's kind of old, but looks pretty good.

Yep - if anything, huskies are clearly the destroyers of homes, let alone them being quiet - considering they have a really high energy drive which is dangerous for anything nearby without giving them enough outlet (which is a given - they are supposed to be sled dogs after all).   More like stereotypes about the people from northern areas leaking in.

Source: akc.org/expert-advice/dog-breeds/most-popular-dog-breeds-of-2021/           Those stats represent the US though, and it's a quite  different case with Japan in terms of popularity - unlike the US where the top usually dominated by labs or shepherds (""big dogs for a big house"", basically), it's more representable with small breeds due to housing conditions and very small apartments in a high-density urban area - so toy poodles, chihuahua and poms are way higher on the rating of popularity (1, 2 and 6 respectably) - and Shiba is, well, a Japanese branded breed, being on 4th place.

Yep - if anything, huskies are clearly the destroyers of homes, let alone them being quiet - considering they have a really high energy drive which is dangerous for anything nearby without giving them enough outlet (which is a given - they are supposed to be sled dogs after all).   More like stereotypes about the people from northern areas leaking in.

Yep - if anything, huskies are clearly the destroyers of homes, let alone them being quiet - considering they have a really high energy drive which is dangerous for anything nearby without giving them enough outlet (which is a given - they are supposed to be sled dogs after all).   More like stereotypes about the people from northern areas leaking in.

It's essentially a dog version of NekoPara, but with significantly more story, drama, and worldbuilding. It's kind of old, but looks pretty good.

Yep - if anything, huskies are clearly the destroyers of homes, let alone them being quiet - considering they have a really high energy drive which is dangerous for anything nearby without giving them enough outlet (which is a given - they are supposed to be sled dogs after all).   More like stereotypes about the people from northern areas leaking in.

Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration.

These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.

For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan.

It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga?

ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately.

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately.

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives      ",positive,en,{}

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives    ",positive,en,{}

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives   ",positive,en,{}

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.

Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.

News SPYAIR Vocalist IKE Leaves Band Due to Ulcerative Colitis   posted on 2022-03-31 22:09 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Concerts from May-July have been canceled    Rock band SPYAIR's vocalist IKE announced on Thursday that he has left the band due to his ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. IKE was first diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in summer 2019 and was hospitalized. He then reached a remission period. However, following a re-examination in January, he found out that the disease has relapsed. He is almost finished with treatment, but he has not reached remission. After discussions with the other members, IKE decided that as it was difficult for him to continue musical activities, he would withdraw from the band.    The other three members UZ, MOMIKEN, and KENTA will remain with the band. Their AIR-GATE LIVE 2022 and JUST LIKE THIS 2022 concerts from May to July have been canceled. There will be refunds.    SPYAIR performed theme songs for Gintama, Haikyu!!, Bleach, Samurai Flamenco, and Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans.

News SPYAIR Vocalist IKE Leaves Band Due to Ulcerative Colitis   posted on 2022-03-31 22:09 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Concerts from May-July have been canceled    Rock band SPYAIR's vocalist IKE announced on Thursday that he has left the band due to his ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. IKE was first diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in summer 2019 and was hospitalized. He then reached a remission period. However, following a re-examination in January, he found out that the disease has relapsed. He is almost finished with treatment, but he has not reached remission. After discussions with the other members, IKE decided that as it was difficult for him to continue musical activities, he would withdraw from the band.    The other three members UZ, MOMIKEN, and KENTA will remain with the band. Their AIR-GATE LIVE 2022 and JUST LIKE THIS 2022 concerts from May to July have been canceled. There will be refunds.    SPYAIR performed theme songs for Gintama, Haikyu!!, Bleach, Samurai Flamenco, and Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans.

How many times can Rikiya Koyama and Sayaka Ohara get paired up together? I think this is the 3rd or 4th time.    So the MC has an ex-girlfriend? It seems like he basically left her with just a note to go back to his family's shop and she ended up following him back to Kyoto. I wonder if they'll get back together...   I was not expecting to see Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as a deadbeat dad. Has he played a dad before aside from Kirito?
