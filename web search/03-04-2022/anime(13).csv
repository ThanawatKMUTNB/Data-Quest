Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.   Join us this June for @SummerGameFest - an industry wide celebration of video games, featuring a spectacular live kickoff show hosted by @geoffkeighley Sign up at https://t.co/1ZwAhZ66ie to be the first to know details. pic.twitter.com/P2eLRISqfQ— Summer Game Fest 2022 (@summergamefest) March 31, 2022    Look forward to that, I guess? ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for. I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on. Earlier this week, Sony unveiled the particulars of its new service, which merges PlayStation Plus with PlayStation Now and adds a few other benefits… to a general reaction of “that's all?”   All-new PlayStation Plus launches in June with three flexible membership options.First details: https://t.co/2KXcEp7XWs pic.twitter.com/jAU9Do3CfE— PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 29, 2022    The new, three-tiered service operates as follows: PS Plus Essentials is the same as the current PS Plus, meaning you get the usual 2 free games a month, cloud saves, online multiplayer, and so on, and it costs the same as before. PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate! Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way. But I'm definitely in the minority, so I think the middle (Extra) tier is likely to be the most popular choice for the masses… but a lot of folks might just ignore the additions entirely and stick with the standard PS Plus. I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…? NEW GAME+ EXPO DELIVERS SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES It's that time again for niche publishers like Idea Factory, Aksys Games, NIS, Natsume, and Inti Creates to show off what they've got in store for later this year! While New Game+ conjures up images of RPGs, there was a lot of variety in the types of games showcased: scrolling action games, visual novels, dungeon crawlers, action-RPGs, open-world adventures, just a nice little mix of stuff. Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!   Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games. If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans. Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights. Man, I am going to be SO BUSY playing stuff in June… ASSORTED NEWSBITS   MOON. -Re:make- has been announced for Switch. No, this isn't moon, the Yoshio Kimura-helmed RPG deconstruction… though, like that game, MOON. -Re:make- does have a place in gaming history: it was made by many of the staff who would go on to form storied visual novel maker Key. No word on if any staff are returning besides artist Itaru Hinoue, though.  Shueisha, the massive Japanese publishing house best known among anime fans for being the overlords of all things Shonen Jump, are starting up a games publishing division called… Shueisha Games. Their announced games so far are mostly indie titles through their Shueisha Creators CAMP initiative, but they're promising bigger things down the line, including a “smartphone game by a prominent studio” with art by a Shonen Jump artist, along a new title co-published with a “major publisher” with a “major game studio” developing. Very intriguing…  There's another Valis collection releasing. The Valis: Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 includes PC Engine Valis IV, the original Valis for Megadrive, and weird spinoff game Syd of Valis, also originally on the Megadrive. Still no sign of the PC-88 originals, though… Look, I am so goddamned tired of talking about Activision-Blizzard, if you want to read about one (of many) lawsuits they've settled for a frankly insulting amount you can click here   That's another week for the books, then. Since it's April Fools’ Day, I invite you all to post your favorite company gags in the forums. Or, if you hate Aprils 1st with a burning passion, you can still discuss everything going on this week, like the death of E3, the delay of Zelda, and all those fresh announcements. As always, the link to join in is just below.

Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.   Join us this June for @SummerGameFest - an industry wide celebration of video games, featuring a spectacular live kickoff show hosted by @geoffkeighley Sign up at https://t.co/1ZwAhZ66ie to be the first to know details. pic.twitter.com/P2eLRISqfQ— Summer Game Fest 2022 (@summergamefest) March 31, 2022    Look forward to that, I guess? ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for. I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on. Earlier this week, Sony unveiled the particulars of its new service, which merges PlayStation Plus with PlayStation Now and adds a few other benefits… to a general reaction of “that's all?”   All-new PlayStation Plus launches in June with three flexible membership options.First details: https://t.co/2KXcEp7XWs pic.twitter.com/jAU9Do3CfE— PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 29, 2022    The new, three-tiered service operates as follows: PS Plus Essentials is the same as the current PS Plus, meaning you get the usual 2 free games a month, cloud saves, online multiplayer, and so on, and it costs the same as before. PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate! Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way. But I'm definitely in the minority, so I think the middle (Extra) tier is likely to be the most popular choice for the masses… but a lot of folks might just ignore the additions entirely and stick with the standard PS Plus. I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…? NEW GAME+ EXPO DELIVERS SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES It's that time again for niche publishers like Idea Factory, Aksys Games, NIS, Natsume, and Inti Creates to show off what they've got in store for later this year! While New Game+ conjures up images of RPGs, there was a lot of variety in the types of games showcased: scrolling action games, visual novels, dungeon crawlers, action-RPGs, open-world adventures, just a nice little mix of stuff. Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!   Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games. If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans. Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights. Man, I am going to be SO BUSY playing stuff in June… ASSORTED NEWSBITS   MOON. -Re:make- has been announced for Switch. No, this isn't moon, the Yoshio Kimura-helmed RPG deconstruction… though, like that game, MOON. -Re:make- does have a place in gaming history: it was made by many of the staff who would go on to form storied visual novel maker Key. No word on if any staff are returning besides artist Itaru Hinoue, though.  Shueisha, the massive Japanese publishing house best known among anime fans for being the overlords of all things Shonen Jump, are starting up a games publishing division called… Shueisha Games. Their announced games so far are mostly indie titles through their Shueisha Creators CAMP initiative, but they're promising bigger things down the line, including a “smartphone game by a prominent studio” with art by a Shonen Jump artist, along a new title co-published with a “major publisher” with a “major game studio” developing. Very intriguing…  There's another Valis collection releasing. The Valis: Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 includes PC Engine Valis IV, the original Valis for Megadrive, and weird spinoff game Syd of Valis, also originally on the Megadrive. Still no sign of the PC-88 originals, though… Look, I am so goddamned tired of talking about Activision-Blizzard, if you want to read about one (of many) lawsuits they've settled for a frankly insulting amount you can click here   That's another week for the books, then. Since it's April Fools’ Day, I invite you all to post your favorite company gags in the forums. Or, if you hate Aprils 1st with a burning passion, you can still discuss everything going on this week, like the death of E3, the delay of Zelda, and all those fresh announcements. As always, the link to join in is just below.

Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.   Join us this June for @SummerGameFest - an industry wide celebration of video games, featuring a spectacular live kickoff show hosted by @geoffkeighley Sign up at https://t.co/1ZwAhZ66ie to be the first to know details. pic.twitter.com/P2eLRISqfQ— Summer Game Fest 2022 (@summergamefest) March 31, 2022    Look forward to that, I guess? ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for. I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on. Earlier this week, Sony unveiled the particulars of its new service, which merges PlayStation Plus with PlayStation Now and adds a few other benefits… to a general reaction of “that's all?”   All-new PlayStation Plus launches in June with three flexible membership options.First details: https://t.co/2KXcEp7XWs pic.twitter.com/jAU9Do3CfE— PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 29, 2022    The new, three-tiered service operates as follows: PS Plus Essentials is the same as the current PS Plus, meaning you get the usual 2 free games a month, cloud saves, online multiplayer, and so on, and it costs the same as before. PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate! Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way. But I'm definitely in the minority, so I think the middle (Extra) tier is likely to be the most popular choice for the masses… but a lot of folks might just ignore the additions entirely and stick with the standard PS Plus. I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…? NEW GAME+ EXPO DELIVERS SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES It's that time again for niche publishers like Idea Factory, Aksys Games, NIS, Natsume, and Inti Creates to show off what they've got in store for later this year! While New Game+ conjures up images of RPGs, there was a lot of variety in the types of games showcased: scrolling action games, visual novels, dungeon crawlers, action-RPGs, open-world adventures, just a nice little mix of stuff. Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!   Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games. If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans. Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights. Man, I am going to be SO BUSY playing stuff in June… ASSORTED NEWSBITS   MOON. -Re:make- has been announced for Switch. No, this isn't moon, the Yoshio Kimura-helmed RPG deconstruction… though, like that game, MOON. -Re:make- does have a place in gaming history: it was made by many of the staff who would go on to form storied visual novel maker Key. No word on if any staff are returning besides artist Itaru Hinoue, though.  Shueisha, the massive Japanese publishing house best known among anime fans for being the overlords of all things Shonen Jump, are starting up a games publishing division called… Shueisha Games. Their announced games so far are mostly indie titles through their Shueisha Creators CAMP initiative, but they're promising bigger things down the line, including a “smartphone game by a prominent studio” with art by a Shonen Jump artist, along a new title co-published with a “major publisher” with a “major game studio” developing. Very intriguing…  There's another Valis collection releasing. The Valis: Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 includes PC Engine Valis IV, the original Valis for Megadrive, and weird spinoff game Syd of Valis, also originally on the Megadrive. Still no sign of the PC-88 originals, though… Look, I am so goddamned tired of talking about Activision-Blizzard, if you want to read about one (of many) lawsuits they've settled for a frankly insulting amount you can click here   That's another week for the books, then.

Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.   Join us this June for @SummerGameFest - an industry wide celebration of video games, featuring a spectacular live kickoff show hosted by @geoffkeighley Sign up at https://t.co/1ZwAhZ66ie to be the first to know details. pic.twitter.com/P2eLRISqfQ— Summer Game Fest 2022 (@summergamefest) March 31, 2022    Look forward to that, I guess? ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for. I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on. Earlier this week, Sony unveiled the particulars of its new service, which merges PlayStation Plus with PlayStation Now and adds a few other benefits… to a general reaction of “that's all?”   All-new PlayStation Plus launches in June with three flexible membership options.First details: https://t.co/2KXcEp7XWs pic.twitter.com/jAU9Do3CfE— PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 29, 2022    The new, three-tiered service operates as follows: PS Plus Essentials is the same as the current PS Plus, meaning you get the usual 2 free games a month, cloud saves, online multiplayer, and so on, and it costs the same as before. PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate! Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way. But I'm definitely in the minority, so I think the middle (Extra) tier is likely to be the most popular choice for the masses… but a lot of folks might just ignore the additions entirely and stick with the standard PS Plus. I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…? NEW GAME+ EXPO DELIVERS SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES It's that time again for niche publishers like Idea Factory, Aksys Games, NIS, Natsume, and Inti Creates to show off what they've got in store for later this year! While New Game+ conjures up images of RPGs, there was a lot of variety in the types of games showcased: scrolling action games, visual novels, dungeon crawlers, action-RPGs, open-world adventures, just a nice little mix of stuff. Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!   Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games. If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans. Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights. Man, I am going to be SO BUSY playing stuff in June… ASSORTED NEWSBITS   MOON. -Re:make- has been announced for Switch. No, this isn't moon, the Yoshio Kimura-helmed RPG deconstruction… though, like that game, MOON. -Re:make- does have a place in gaming history: it was made by many of the staff who would go on to form storied visual novel maker Key. No word on if any staff are returning besides artist Itaru Hinoue, though.  Shueisha, the massive Japanese publishing house best known among anime fans for being the overlords of all things Shonen Jump, are starting up a games publishing division called… Shueisha Games. Their announced games so far are mostly indie titles through their Shueisha Creators CAMP initiative, but they're promising bigger things down the line, including a “smartphone game by a prominent studio” with art by a Shonen Jump artist, along a new title co-published with a “major publisher” with a “major game studio” developing. Very intriguing…  There's another Valis collection releasing. The Valis: Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 includes PC Engine Valis IV, the original Valis for Megadrive, and weird spinoff game Syd of Valis, also originally on the Megadrive. Still no sign of the PC-88 originals, though… Look, I am so goddamned tired of talking about Activision-Blizzard, if you want to read about one (of many) lawsuits they've settled for a frankly insulting amount you can click here   That's another week for the books, then.

Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.   Join us this June for @SummerGameFest - an industry wide celebration of video games, featuring a spectacular live kickoff show hosted by @geoffkeighley Sign up at https://t.co/1ZwAhZ66ie to be the first to know details. pic.twitter.com/P2eLRISqfQ— Summer Game Fest 2022 (@summergamefest) March 31, 2022    Look forward to that, I guess? ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for. I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on. Earlier this week, Sony unveiled the particulars of its new service, which merges PlayStation Plus with PlayStation Now and adds a few other benefits… to a general reaction of “that's all?”   All-new PlayStation Plus launches in June with three flexible membership options.First details: https://t.co/2KXcEp7XWs pic.twitter.com/jAU9Do3CfE— PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 29, 2022    The new, three-tiered service operates as follows: PS Plus Essentials is the same as the current PS Plus, meaning you get the usual 2 free games a month, cloud saves, online multiplayer, and so on, and it costs the same as before. PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate! Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way. But I'm definitely in the minority, so I think the middle (Extra) tier is likely to be the most popular choice for the masses… but a lot of folks might just ignore the additions entirely and stick with the standard PS Plus. I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…? NEW GAME+ EXPO DELIVERS SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES It's that time again for niche publishers like Idea Factory, Aksys Games, NIS, Natsume, and Inti Creates to show off what they've got in store for later this year! While New Game+ conjures up images of RPGs, there was a lot of variety in the types of games showcased: scrolling action games, visual novels, dungeon crawlers, action-RPGs, open-world adventures, just a nice little mix of stuff. Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!   Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games. If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans. Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights. Man, I am going to be SO BUSY playing stuff in June… ASSORTED NEWSBITS   MOON. -Re:make- has been announced for Switch. No, this isn't moon, the Yoshio Kimura-helmed RPG deconstruction… though, like that game, MOON. -Re:make- does have a place in gaming history: it was made by many of the staff who would go on to form storied visual novel maker Key. No word on if any staff are returning besides artist Itaru Hinoue, though.  Shueisha, the massive Japanese publishing house best known among anime fans for being the overlords of all things Shonen Jump, are starting up a games publishing division called… Shueisha Games. Their announced games so far are mostly indie titles through their Shueisha Creators CAMP initiative, but they're promising bigger things down the line, including a “smartphone game by a prominent studio” with art by a Shonen Jump artist, along a new title co-published with a “major publisher” with a “major game studio” developing. Very intriguing…  There's another Valis collection releasing. The Valis: Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 includes PC Engine Valis IV, the original Valis for Megadrive, and weird spinoff game Syd of Valis, also originally on the Megadrive. Still no sign of the PC-88 originals, though… Look, I am so goddamned tired of talking about Activision-Blizzard, if you want to read about one (of many) lawsuits they've settled for a frankly insulting amount you can click here   That's another week for the books, then. Since it's April Fools’ Day, I invite you all to post your favorite company gags in the forums. Or, if you hate Aprils 1st with a burning passion, you can still discuss everything going on this week, like the death of E3, the delay of Zelda, and all those fresh announcements.

PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate! Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way. But I'm definitely in the minority, so I think the middle (Extra) tier is likely to be the most popular choice for the masses… but a lot of folks might just ignore the additions entirely and stick with the standard PS Plus. I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…? NEW GAME+ EXPO DELIVERS SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES It's that time again for niche publishers like Idea Factory, Aksys Games, NIS, Natsume, and Inti Creates to show off what they've got in store for later this year! While New Game+ conjures up images of RPGs, there was a lot of variety in the types of games showcased: scrolling action games, visual novels, dungeon crawlers, action-RPGs, open-world adventures, just a nice little mix of stuff. Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!   Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games. If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans. Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights. Man, I am going to be SO BUSY playing stuff in June… ASSORTED NEWSBITS   MOON. -Re:make- has been announced for Switch. No, this isn't moon, the Yoshio Kimura-helmed RPG deconstruction… though, like that game, MOON. -Re:make- does have a place in gaming history: it was made by many of the staff who would go on to form storied visual novel maker Key. No word on if any staff are returning besides artist Itaru Hinoue, though.  Shueisha, the massive Japanese publishing house best known among anime fans for being the overlords of all things Shonen Jump, are starting up a games publishing division called… Shueisha Games. Their announced games so far are mostly indie titles through their Shueisha Creators CAMP initiative, but they're promising bigger things down the line, including a “smartphone game by a prominent studio” with art by a Shonen Jump artist, along a new title co-published with a “major publisher” with a “major game studio” developing. Very intriguing…  There's another Valis collection releasing. The Valis: Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 includes PC Engine Valis IV, the original Valis for Megadrive, and weird spinoff game Syd of Valis, also originally on the Megadrive. Still no sign of the PC-88 originals, though… Look, I am so goddamned tired of talking about Activision-Blizzard, if you want to read about one (of many) lawsuits they've settled for a frankly insulting amount you can click here   That's another week for the books, then. Since it's April Fools’ Day, I invite you all to post your favorite company gags in the forums. Or, if you hate Aprils 1st with a burning passion, you can still discuss everything going on this week, like the death of E3, the delay of Zelda, and all those fresh announcements. As always, the link to join in is just below. Take it easy and enjoy the weekend, and try not to be too disappointed when that awesome announcement you saw online turns out to be complete BS, OK?     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    This Week in Games homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,Don't Set,{}

Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.   Join us this June for @SummerGameFest - an industry wide celebration of video games, featuring a spectacular live kickoff show hosted by @geoffkeighley Sign up at https://t.co/1ZwAhZ66ie to be the first to know details. pic.twitter.com/P2eLRISqfQ— Summer Game Fest 2022 (@summergamefest) March 31, 2022    Look forward to that, I guess? ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for. I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on.

Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!   Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games. If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans. Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights. Man, I am going to be SO BUSY playing stuff in June… ASSORTED NEWSBITS   MOON. -Re:make- has been announced for Switch. No, this isn't moon, the Yoshio Kimura-helmed RPG deconstruction… though, like that game, MOON. -Re:make- does have a place in gaming history: it was made by many of the staff who would go on to form storied visual novel maker Key. No word on if any staff are returning besides artist Itaru Hinoue, though.  Shueisha, the massive Japanese publishing house best known among anime fans for being the overlords of all things Shonen Jump, are starting up a games publishing division called… Shueisha Games. Their announced games so far are mostly indie titles through their Shueisha Creators CAMP initiative, but they're promising bigger things down the line, including a “smartphone game by a prominent studio” with art by a Shonen Jump artist, along a new title co-published with a “major publisher” with a “major game studio” developing. Very intriguing…  There's another Valis collection releasing. The Valis: Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 includes PC Engine Valis IV, the original Valis for Megadrive, and weird spinoff game Syd of Valis, also originally on the Megadrive. Still no sign of the PC-88 originals, though… Look, I am so goddamned tired of talking about Activision-Blizzard, if you want to read about one (of many) lawsuits they've settled for a frankly insulting amount you can click here   That's another week for the books, then. Since it's April Fools’ Day, I invite you all to post your favorite company gags in the forums. Or, if you hate Aprils 1st with a burning passion, you can still discuss everything going on this week, like the death of E3, the delay of Zelda, and all those fresh announcements. As always, the link to join in is just below. Take it easy and enjoy the weekend, and try not to be too disappointed when that awesome announcement you saw online turns out to be complete BS, OK?     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    This Week in Games homepage / archives     ",positive,Don't Set,{}
03-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-x-button/2022-04-01/this-week-in-games-rip-e3/.184241,None Title,"       Hey everyone, it's April Fools’ Day! Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.   Join us this June for @SummerGameFest - an industry wide celebration of video games, featuring a spectacular live kickoff show hosted by @geoffkeighley Sign up at https://t.co/1ZwAhZ66ie to be the first to know details. pic.twitter.com/P2eLRISqfQ— Summer Game Fest 2022 (@summergamefest) March 31, 2022    Look forward to that, I guess? ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for. I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on. Earlier this week, Sony unveiled the particulars of its new service, which merges PlayStation Plus with PlayStation Now and adds a few other benefits… to a general reaction of “that's all?”   All-new PlayStation Plus launches in June with three flexible membership options.First details: https://t.co/2KXcEp7XWs pic.twitter.com/jAU9Do3CfE— PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 29, 2022    The new, three-tiered service operates as follows: PS Plus Essentials is the same as the current PS Plus, meaning you get the usual 2 free games a month, cloud saves, online multiplayer, and so on, and it costs the same as before. PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate! Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way. But I'm definitely in the minority, so I think the middle (Extra) tier is likely to be the most popular choice for the masses… but a lot of folks might just ignore the additions entirely and stick with the standard PS Plus. I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…?

Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc.

Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights. Man, I am going to be SO BUSY playing stuff in June… ASSORTED NEWSBITS   MOON. -Re:make- has been announced for Switch. No, this isn't moon, the Yoshio Kimura-helmed RPG deconstruction… though, like that game, MOON. -Re:make- does have a place in gaming history: it was made by many of the staff who would go on to form storied visual novel maker Key. No word on if any staff are returning besides artist Itaru Hinoue, though.  Shueisha, the massive Japanese publishing house best known among anime fans for being the overlords of all things Shonen Jump, are starting up a games publishing division called… Shueisha Games. Their announced games so far are mostly indie titles through their Shueisha Creators CAMP initiative, but they're promising bigger things down the line, including a “smartphone game by a prominent studio” with art by a Shonen Jump artist, along a new title co-published with a “major publisher” with a “major game studio” developing. Very intriguing…  There's another Valis collection releasing. The Valis: Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 includes PC Engine Valis IV, the original Valis for Megadrive, and weird spinoff game Syd of Valis, also originally on the Megadrive. Still no sign of the PC-88 originals, though… Look, I am so goddamned tired of talking about Activision-Blizzard, if you want to read about one (of many) lawsuits they've settled for a frankly insulting amount you can click here   That's another week for the books, then. Since it's April Fools’ Day, I invite you all to post your favorite company gags in the forums. Or, if you hate Aprils 1st with a burning passion, you can still discuss everything going on this week, like the death of E3, the delay of Zelda, and all those fresh announcements.

03-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-x-button/2022-04-01/this-week-in-games-rip-e3/.184241,None Title,"   Hey everyone, it's April Fools’ Day! Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.   Join us this June for @SummerGameFest - an industry wide celebration of video games, featuring a spectacular live kickoff show hosted by @geoffkeighley Sign up at https://t.co/1ZwAhZ66ie to be the first to know details. pic.twitter.com/P2eLRISqfQ— Summer Game Fest 2022 (@summergamefest) March 31, 2022    Look forward to that, I guess? ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for. I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on. Earlier this week, Sony unveiled the particulars of its new service, which merges PlayStation Plus with PlayStation Now and adds a few other benefits… to a general reaction of “that's all?”   All-new PlayStation Plus launches in June with three flexible membership options.First details: https://t.co/2KXcEp7XWs pic.twitter.com/jAU9Do3CfE— PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 29, 2022    The new, three-tiered service operates as follows: PS Plus Essentials is the same as the current PS Plus, meaning you get the usual 2 free games a month, cloud saves, online multiplayer, and so on, and it costs the same as before. PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate! Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way. But I'm definitely in the minority, so I think the middle (Extra) tier is likely to be the most popular choice for the masses… but a lot of folks might just ignore the additions entirely and stick with the standard PS Plus. I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…? NEW GAME+ EXPO DELIVERS SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES It's that time again for niche publishers like Idea Factory, Aksys Games, NIS, Natsume, and Inti Creates to show off what they've got in store for later this year! While New Game+ conjures up images of RPGs, there was a lot of variety in the types of games showcased: scrolling action games, visual novels, dungeon crawlers, action-RPGs, open-world adventures, just a nice little mix of stuff. Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!   Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games. If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans.

Interest The Two Upcoming Healer Anime Unite in April Fool's Visual   posted on 2022-04-01 10:00 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy          Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! & Healer Girl will premiere this April    The Spring 2022 anime season is just around the corner, and it's notable this year for debuting not one but two healer-themed anime: Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! and Healer Girl. This amusing coincidence has not been lost on the producers; the two anime teamed up on Friday for an April Fool's crossover visual.     ©Healer Girl Project   Lead voice actresses Aguri Ōnishi (Karla from Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!) and Carin Isobe (Kana Fujii from Healer Girl) participated in a joint interview commenting on the collaboration. The complimented each other's voice performances and remarked on how, despite both featuring healers, the two anime have a completely different tone: Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is a comedy, while Healer Girl is soothing.    Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! will premiere on April 10. The ""isekai burnt-out adventurer comedy"" centers on two adventurers: the hopeless swordsman Arvin, and the sarcastic dark-elf healer Karla, who seems to be more talented with ticking people off than healing.    Healer Girl will premiere on April 4. The story is set in a world where three schools of medicine are pervasive: Western medicine, Eastern medicine, and ""vocal medicine."" The healing of illness and injuries via songs is a special technique that not only improves the metal health of patients, but also the mental health of doctors. Such ""Healers"" strive to sing when called upon to respond to the health and anxiety of patients and doctors alike. The anime depicts the healer girls in training at the Karasuma Vocal Medical Institute.

Interest The Two Upcoming Healer Anime Unite in April Fool's Visual   posted on 2022-04-01 10:00 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy          Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! & Healer Girl will premiere this April    The Spring 2022 anime season is just around the corner, and it's notable this year for debuting not one but two healer-themed anime: Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! and Healer Girl. This amusing coincidence has not been lost on the producers; the two anime teamed up on Friday for an April Fool's crossover visual.     ©Healer Girl Project   Lead voice actresses Aguri Ōnishi (Karla from Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!) and Carin Isobe (Kana Fujii from Healer Girl) participated in a joint interview commenting on the collaboration. The complimented each other's voice performances and remarked on how, despite both featuring healers, the two anime have a completely different tone: Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is a comedy, while Healer Girl is soothing.    Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! will premiere on April 10. The ""isekai burnt-out adventurer comedy"" centers on two adventurers: the hopeless swordsman Arvin, and the sarcastic dark-elf healer Karla, who seems to be more talented with ticking people off than healing.    Healer Girl will premiere on April 4. The story is set in a world where three schools of medicine are pervasive: Western medicine, Eastern medicine, and ""vocal medicine."" The healing of illness and injuries via songs is a special technique that not only improves the metal health of patients, but also the mental health of doctors. Such ""Healers"" strive to sing when called upon to respond to the health and anxiety of patients and doctors alike. The anime depicts the healer girls in training at the Karasuma Vocal Medical Institute.

I didn't see this coming. I was just relistening to Last Moment the other day because I needed to hear some early SPYAIR songs again. IKE's voice was so impactful in that song. Easily my favorite part of the song. Now to hear he's leaving? SPYAIR isn't fully SPYAIR without IKE. No one can replace his voice. This hurts so bad that IKE has to leave like this. I wish nothing but the best for IKE. Thank you for the amazing memories.

This is a pretty crappy (literally) condition, and unpredictable as well, even remissions don't last forever... so long-term planning for travels, public appearances, etc. is nigh impossible. It really affects one's life. Good luck to him!      Back to top                  JustMonika    Joined: 17 Jan 2022 		    Posts: 88       Posted: Thu Mar 31, 2022 11:02 am            Wowser..

I didn't see this coming. I was just relistening to Last Moment the other day because I needed to hear some early SPYAIR songs again. IKE's voice was so impactful in that song. Easily my favorite part of the song. Now to hear he's leaving? SPYAIR isn't fully SPYAIR without IKE. No one can replace his voice. This hurts so bad that IKE has to leave like this. I wish nothing but the best for IKE. Thank you for the amazing memories.

I didn't see this coming. I was just relistening to Last Moment the other day because I needed to hear some early SPYAIR songs again. IKE's voice was so impactful in that song. Easily my favorite part of the song. Now to hear he's leaving? SPYAIR isn't fully SPYAIR without IKE. No one can replace his voice. This hurts so bad that IKE has to leave like this. I wish nothing but the best for IKE. Thank you for the amazing memories.

I didn't see this coming. I was just relistening to Last Moment the other day because I needed to hear some early SPYAIR songs again. IKE's voice was so impactful in that song. Easily my favorite part of the song. Now to hear he's leaving? SPYAIR isn't fully SPYAIR without IKE. No one can replace his voice. This hurts so bad that IKE has to leave like this. I wish nothing but the best for IKE. Thank you for the amazing memories.

This is a pretty crappy (literally) condition, and unpredictable as well, even remissions don't last forever... so long-term planning for travels, public appearances, etc. is nigh impossible. It really affects one's life. Good luck to him!      Back to top                  JustMonika    Joined: 17 Jan 2022 		    Posts: 88       Posted: Thu Mar 31, 2022 11:02 am            Wowser..

This is turning out to be a surprisingly fun and cute show. MAO and Satoshi Hino are really delivering as their respective characters, and the comedy writing is on-point.

Maybe it's just me but I thought that this was made amply clear in episode two the latest... but even in episode one Jinguuji calls Tachibana his ""paradise"", the only one at whose side he feels comfortable, etc., is aghast at the idea of his ""best friend"" being taken away from him by some wench, and generally behaves like any ""super darling"" type romantic male lead. And then in episode two his ""I love this about you"" moment prompts a long flashback about male!Tachibana...    The premise may be problematic (I don't necessarily see it as such though) but I don't think the show has ever tried to insist that their feelings are actually the work of the curse. If anything I think it's going in a ""you were always in love you just didn't realize it because both of you were guys"" direction.

I love what the reviewer painted out for telulilo , it confirms the theory that source readers felt similar and spoiler[telulilo is gone asap and the author later tries with other characters]      Back to top                  MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3764       Posted: Fri Jan 28, 2022 11:03 am            I feel both amused and kind of bad for the elf Premier for how badly this episode went for her.

She Professed Herself the Pupil of the Wise Man came off as the author just adding the gender bender tag to make their WN stick out amongst all the other 'cute girl doing cute things' stories on the WN website since the gender bending aspect basically is irrelevant as the MC acts fully like a girl from the very start.

I have read through the first few arcs and I (Mildly) disagree with that.  The MC expresses a lot of dismay and embarrassment over it, though I think that secretly the form pleases them.   In the Anime.. yeah, she doesn't miss a beat.   In the WN, she spends a lot of time mourning the loss of the ""Wizened Wizard"" persona, off and on, but at a certain point seems to give up and embrace the new form.  Not a lot of time is spent on it, and.. it is not exactly a very deep WN.

Then Tachibana flipped that back.  So I guess we had similar reactions, but in opposite directions, which, if that was their intention, was pretty clever.   Boyfriend shirt was pure gold.  Not too crazy about the demon lord's hyper gremlin though.

Once they introduced ""Charmed"" Jinguuji  didn't stand a chance, now all the Otome cliché's are truly out to get him....    ""Boyfriend shirt"" - top anime couple trigger...   Having re-watched the first episode the goddess didn't specifically mention what the curse was apart from the desire to ""defeat the demon king"". So they're probably suffering from their bromance being magnified now the potential homosexual hang-up has been removed.   Schwa-kun makes a good Kirito parody and if his real name is reveled and it is an SAO reference it'll be all the better.

She seems pretty chill and cool, and gets along well with Schwa.   Ah, Tachibana thinks Jinguuji is as powerful as a sacred weapon! Which did pay off in their new fantasy life.   I guess this is the last we'll see of Schwa and co. since he's sticking around in the village. Well, at least they respect him now. His Goddess has no idea he lost his sword though.    Poor Elf Premier. Gets kidnapped and the pair don't lift a finger to save her, then she thinks she's going to be ravished...then sacrificed...all because she's so beautiful...and then Tachibana steals her thunder.

This is turning out to be a surprisingly fun and cute show. MAO and Satoshi Hino are really delivering as their respective characters, and the comedy writing is on-point.      Back to top                  SHD    Joined: 05 Apr 2015 		    Posts: 1148       Posted: Wed Jan 19, 2022 4:17 pm              Quote:    While the characters (and possibly the show itself) might insist that's the work of the mysterious curse placed on them by the Goddess, it's equally possible this genderbending chicanery has just opened the door for both parties to consider possibilities they never dared to consider while both had male bodies.           Maybe it's just me but I thought that this was made amply clear in episode two the latest... but even in episode one Jinguuji calls Tachibana his ""paradise"", the only one at whose side he feels comfortable, etc., is aghast at the idea of his ""best friend"" being taken away from him by some wench, and generally behaves like any ""super darling"" type romantic male lead. And then in episode two his ""I love this about you"" moment prompts a long flashback about male!Tachibana...    The premise may be problematic (I don't necessarily see it as such though) but I don't think the show has ever tried to insist that their feelings are actually the work of the curse. If anything I think it's going in a ""you were always in love you just didn't realize it because both of you were guys"" direction.

I love what the reviewer painted out for telulilo , it confirms the theory that source readers felt similar and spoiler[telulilo is gone asap and the author later tries with other characters]      Back to top                  MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3764       Posted: Fri Jan 28, 2022 11:03 am            I feel both amused and kind of bad for the elf Premier for how badly this episode went for her.

She Professed Herself the Pupil of the Wise Man came off as the author just adding the gender bender tag to make their WN stick out amongst all the other 'cute girl doing cute things' stories on the WN website since the gender bending aspect basically is irrelevant as the MC acts fully like a girl from the very start.

I have read through the first few arcs and I (Mildly) disagree with that.  The MC expresses a lot of dismay and embarrassment over it, though I think that secretly the form pleases them.   In the Anime.. yeah, she doesn't miss a beat.   In the WN, she spends a lot of time mourning the loss of the ""Wizened Wizard"" persona, off and on, but at a certain point seems to give up and embrace the new form.  Not a lot of time is spent on it, and.. it is not exactly a very deep WN.

Then Tachibana flipped that back.  So I guess we had similar reactions, but in opposite directions, which, if that was their intention, was pretty clever.   Boyfriend shirt was pure gold.  Not too crazy about the demon lord's hyper gremlin though.

Once they introduced ""Charmed"" Jinguuji  didn't stand a chance, now all the Otome cliché's are truly out to get him....    ""Boyfriend shirt"" - top anime couple trigger...   Having re-watched the first episode the goddess didn't specifically mention what the curse was apart from the desire to ""defeat the demon king"". So they're probably suffering from their bromance being magnified now the potential homosexual hang-up has been removed.   Schwa-kun makes a good Kirito parody and if his real name is reveled and it is an SAO reference it'll be all the better.

She seems pretty chill and cool, and gets along well with Schwa.   Ah, Tachibana thinks Jinguuji is as powerful as a sacred weapon! Which did pay off in their new fantasy life.   I guess this is the last we'll see of Schwa and co. since he's sticking around in the village. Well, at least they respect him now. His Goddess has no idea he lost his sword though.    Poor Elf Premier. Gets kidnapped and the pair don't lift a finger to save her, then she thinks she's going to be ravished...then sacrificed...all because she's so beautiful...and then Tachibana steals her thunder.

This is turning out to be a surprisingly fun and cute show. MAO and Satoshi Hino are really delivering as their respective characters, and the comedy writing is on-point.      Back to top                  SHD    Joined: 05 Apr 2015 		    Posts: 1148       Posted: Wed Jan 19, 2022 4:17 pm              Quote:    While the characters (and possibly the show itself) might insist that's the work of the mysterious curse placed on them by the Goddess, it's equally possible this genderbending chicanery has just opened the door for both parties to consider possibilities they never dared to consider while both had male bodies.           Maybe it's just me but I thought that this was made amply clear in episode two the latest... but even in episode one Jinguuji calls Tachibana his ""paradise"", the only one at whose side he feels comfortable, etc., is aghast at the idea of his ""best friend"" being taken away from him by some wench, and generally behaves like any ""super darling"" type romantic male lead. And then in episode two his ""I love this about you"" moment prompts a long flashback about male!Tachibana...    The premise may be problematic (I don't necessarily see it as such though) but I don't think the show has ever tried to insist that their feelings are actually the work of the curse. If anything I think it's going in a ""you were always in love you just didn't realize it because both of you were guys"" direction.

It has gone well past my expectations and is all set to save my genderbender-loving heart this season.            yeah gender bent Isekai has to focus on that fact or give a good reason why the fact is plot irrelevant. the pupil one does neither, one unnamed game Isekai does something pretty clever the male mc does not seem to be affected by the gender change but as the plot progresses he realizes he is acting more and more like the game character, so there is something fishy going on, as in , his personality is meeting with the original body owner and that is why he never felt the gender change.   I love what the reviewer painted out for telulilo , it confirms the theory that source readers felt similar and spoiler[telulilo is gone asap and the author later tries with other characters]      Back to top                  MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3764       Posted: Fri Jan 28, 2022 11:03 am            I feel both amused and kind of bad for the elf Premier for how badly this episode went for her.

She Professed Herself the Pupil of the Wise Man came off as the author just adding the gender bender tag to make their WN stick out amongst all the other 'cute girl doing cute things' stories on the WN website since the gender bending aspect basically is irrelevant as the MC acts fully like a girl from the very start.

I have read through the first few arcs and I (Mildly) disagree with that.  The MC expresses a lot of dismay and embarrassment over it, though I think that secretly the form pleases them.   In the Anime.. yeah, she doesn't miss a beat.   In the WN, she spends a lot of time mourning the loss of the ""Wizened Wizard"" persona, off and on, but at a certain point seems to give up and embrace the new form.  Not a lot of time is spent on it, and.. it is not exactly a very deep WN.

Then Tachibana flipped that back.  So I guess we had similar reactions, but in opposite directions, which, if that was their intention, was pretty clever.   Boyfriend shirt was pure gold.  Not too crazy about the demon lord's hyper gremlin though.

Once they introduced ""Charmed"" Jinguuji  didn't stand a chance, now all the Otome cliché's are truly out to get him....    ""Boyfriend shirt"" - top anime couple trigger...   Having re-watched the first episode the goddess didn't specifically mention what the curse was apart from the desire to ""defeat the demon king"". So they're probably suffering from their bromance being magnified now the potential homosexual hang-up has been removed.   Schwa-kun makes a good Kirito parody and if his real name is reveled and it is an SAO reference it'll be all the better.

She seems pretty chill and cool, and gets along well with Schwa.   Ah, Tachibana thinks Jinguuji is as powerful as a sacred weapon! Which did pay off in their new fantasy life.   I guess this is the last we'll see of Schwa and co. since he's sticking around in the village. Well, at least they respect him now. His Goddess has no idea he lost his sword though.

Gets kidnapped and the pair don't lift a finger to save her, then she thinks she's going to be ravished...then sacrificed...all because she's so beautiful...and then Tachibana steals her thunder.

Maybe it's just me but I thought that this was made amply clear in episode two the latest... but even in episode one Jinguuji calls Tachibana his ""paradise"", the only one at whose side he feels comfortable, etc., is aghast at the idea of his ""best friend"" being taken away from him by some wench, and generally behaves like any ""super darling"" type romantic male lead. And then in episode two his ""I love this about you"" moment prompts a long flashback about male!Tachibana...    The premise may be problematic (I don't necessarily see it as such though) but I don't think the show has ever tried to insist that their feelings are actually the work of the curse. If anything I think it's going in a ""you were always in love you just didn't realize it because both of you were guys"" direction.

I love what the reviewer painted out for telulilo , it confirms the theory that source readers felt similar and spoiler[telulilo is gone asap and the author later tries with other characters]      Back to top                  MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3764       Posted: Fri Jan 28, 2022 11:03 am            I feel both amused and kind of bad for the elf Premier for how badly this episode went for her.

She Professed Herself the Pupil of the Wise Man came off as the author just adding the gender bender tag to make their WN stick out amongst all the other 'cute girl doing cute things' stories on the WN website since the gender bending aspect basically is irrelevant as the MC acts fully like a girl from the very start.

I have read through the first few arcs and I (Mildly) disagree with that.  The MC expresses a lot of dismay and embarrassment over it, though I think that secretly the form pleases them.   In the Anime.. yeah, she doesn't miss a beat.   In the WN, she spends a lot of time mourning the loss of the ""Wizened Wizard"" persona, off and on, but at a certain point seems to give up and embrace the new form.  Not a lot of time is spent on it, and.. it is not exactly a very deep WN.

It has gone well past my expectations and is all set to save my genderbender-loving heart this season.            yeah gender bent Isekai has to focus on that fact or give a good reason why the fact is plot irrelevant. the pupil one does neither, one unnamed game Isekai does something pretty clever the male mc does not seem to be affected by the gender change but as the plot progresses he realizes he is acting more and more like the game character, so there is something fishy going on, as in , his personality is meeting with the original body owner and that is why he never felt the gender change.   I love what the reviewer painted out for telulilo , it confirms the theory that source readers felt similar and spoiler[telulilo is gone asap and the author later tries with other characters]      Back to top                  MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3764       Posted: Fri Jan 28, 2022 11:03 am            I feel both amused and kind of bad for the elf Premier for how badly this episode went for her.

I have read through the first few arcs and I (Mildly) disagree with that.  The MC expresses a lot of dismay and embarrassment over it, though I think that secretly the form pleases them.   In the Anime.. yeah, she doesn't miss a beat.   In the WN, she spends a lot of time mourning the loss of the ""Wizened Wizard"" persona, off and on, but at a certain point seems to give up and embrace the new form.  Not a lot of time is spent on it, and.. it is not exactly a very deep WN.

Then Tachibana flipped that back.  So I guess we had similar reactions, but in opposite directions, which, if that was their intention, was pretty clever.   Boyfriend shirt was pure gold.

Once they introduced ""Charmed"" Jinguuji  didn't stand a chance, now all the Otome cliché's are truly out to get him....    ""Boyfriend shirt"" - top anime couple trigger...   Having re-watched the first episode the goddess didn't specifically mention what the curse was apart from the desire to ""defeat the demon king"". So they're probably suffering from their bromance being magnified now the potential homosexual hang-up has been removed.   Schwa-kun makes a good Kirito parody and if his real name is reveled and it is an SAO reference it'll be all the better.

Maybe it's just me but I thought that this was made amply clear in episode two the latest... but even in episode one Jinguuji calls Tachibana his ""paradise"", the only one at whose side he feels comfortable, etc., is aghast at the idea of his ""best friend"" being taken away from him by some wench, and generally behaves like any ""super darling"" type romantic male lead. And then in episode two his ""I love this about you"" moment prompts a long flashback about male!Tachibana...    The premise may be problematic (I don't necessarily see it as such though) but I don't think the show has ever tried to insist that their feelings are actually the work of the curse. If anything I think it's going in a ""you were always in love you just didn't realize it because both of you were guys"" direction.

She Professed Herself the Pupil of the Wise Man came off as the author just adding the gender bender tag to make their WN stick out amongst all the other 'cute girl doing cute things' stories on the WN website since the gender bending aspect basically is irrelevant as the MC acts fully like a girl from the very start.

I have read through the first few arcs and I (Mildly) disagree with that.  The MC expresses a lot of dismay and embarrassment over it, though I think that secretly the form pleases them.   In the Anime.. yeah, she doesn't miss a beat.   In the WN, she spends a lot of time mourning the loss of the ""Wizened Wizard"" persona, off and on, but at a certain point seems to give up and embrace the new form.  Not a lot of time is spent on it, and.. it is not exactly a very deep WN.

Then Tachibana flipped that back.  So I guess we had similar reactions, but in opposite directions, which, if that was their intention, was pretty clever.   Boyfriend shirt was pure gold.  Not too crazy about the demon lord's hyper gremlin though.

She seems pretty chill and cool, and gets along well with Schwa.   Ah, Tachibana thinks Jinguuji is as powerful as a sacred weapon! Which did pay off in their new fantasy life.   I guess this is the last we'll see of Schwa and co. since he's sticking around in the village. Well, at least they respect him now. His Goddess has no idea he lost his sword though.    Poor Elf Premier. Gets kidnapped and the pair don't lift a finger to save her, then she thinks she's going to be ravished...then sacrificed...all because she's so beautiful...and then Tachibana steals her thunder.

I love what the reviewer painted out for telulilo , it confirms the theory that source readers felt similar and spoiler[telulilo is gone asap and the author later tries with other characters]  ",positive,en,{}

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception.

Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.
