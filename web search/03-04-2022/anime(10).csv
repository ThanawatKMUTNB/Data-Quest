Interest avex Highlights Success of Muv-Luv Alternative NFTs   posted on 2022-04-01 00:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy          GONZO also promotes ""SAMURAI cryptos"" blockchain/NFT project at AnimeJapan booth    Asahi Iwanaga, Representative Director of Avex Technologies, Inc., highlighted the success of the Muv-Luv Alternative anime's NFT project in a business seminar at AnimeJapan on Monday. 11,115 Keyframe Card packs were sold, averaging 38,448 yen (approximately US$315) per sale.    The Muv-Luve Alternative franchise partnered with the Sakura Gate tech company last October to launch a Keyframe Card service featuring key animation frames from the anime. Although the Keyframe Cards will not have NFT functionality at launch, they will be added later as a means to incentivize owners to buy and trade cards on the NFT marketplace. Note that owning the Keyframe Card of a scene is not equivalent to owning the copyright, which is retained by the original IP holders.    As an extra incentive for the fans, those who bought a certain number of cards had their names listed in the credits of the Muv-Luv Alternative Blu-ray Box and the accompanying booklet. The sets shipped in January and March.    Iwanaga described the cards as an effective product to target a small audience of ""core"" fans, who are interested in NFTs but lack the means to engage with them. He said that in the anime world, NFTs can be used to further monetize an IP by selling them as a limited-edition collector's item.    Nevertheless, he recognized the challenges of implementing NFTs, pointing to the proliferation of unauthorized NFTs on OpenSea. He also clarified the distinction between digital ownership and copyright, and recommended that companies get in contact with a specialist in IP law before investing in NFTs. In particular, care must be taken so that the original rights holders can continue to profit even after customers sell their NFTs to other people. He said that this can be done be selling NFTs directly to the consumer first, rather than putting them on an open marketplace.    Avex Technologies launched a blockchain service in 2019 to prove ownership of digital property. In April 2021, the company launched a beta version of Assetbank, an IP distribution service focused on NFTs.    On the AnimeJapan show floor last weekend, animation studio Gonzo promoted its ""SAMURAI cryptos"" blockchain/NFT project at its booth. Gonzo president Shinichiro Ichikawa said that the project will create ""a new era of animation for the NFT era with Japanese samurai,"" and will focus on the keywords ""Cypher,"" ""Decentral,"" and ""Solidarity."" The project will feature designs by Makoto Kobayashi (Last Exile, Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ), Michinori Chiba (Basilisk, Sk8 the Infinity), and Hiroya Iijima (Afro Samurai, Mazinger Z: Infinity).

Interest avex Highlights Success of Muv-Luv Alternative NFTs   posted on 2022-04-01 00:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy          GONZO also promotes ""SAMURAI cryptos"" blockchain/NFT project at AnimeJapan booth    Asahi Iwanaga, Representative Director of Avex Technologies, Inc., highlighted the success of the Muv-Luv Alternative anime's NFT project in a business seminar at AnimeJapan on Monday. 11,115 Keyframe Card packs were sold, averaging 38,448 yen (approximately US$315) per sale.    The Muv-Luve Alternative franchise partnered with the Sakura Gate tech company last October to launch a Keyframe Card service featuring key animation frames from the anime. Although the Keyframe Cards will not have NFT functionality at launch, they will be added later as a means to incentivize owners to buy and trade cards on the NFT marketplace. Note that owning the Keyframe Card of a scene is not equivalent to owning the copyright, which is retained by the original IP holders.    As an extra incentive for the fans, those who bought a certain number of cards had their names listed in the credits of the Muv-Luv Alternative Blu-ray Box and the accompanying booklet. The sets shipped in January and March.    Iwanaga described the cards as an effective product to target a small audience of ""core"" fans, who are interested in NFTs but lack the means to engage with them. He said that in the anime world, NFTs can be used to further monetize an IP by selling them as a limited-edition collector's item.    Nevertheless, he recognized the challenges of implementing NFTs, pointing to the proliferation of unauthorized NFTs on OpenSea. He also clarified the distinction between digital ownership and copyright, and recommended that companies get in contact with a specialist in IP law before investing in NFTs. In particular, care must be taken so that the original rights holders can continue to profit even after customers sell their NFTs to other people. He said that this can be done be selling NFTs directly to the consumer first, rather than putting them on an open marketplace.    Avex Technologies launched a blockchain service in 2019 to prove ownership of digital property. In April 2021, the company launched a beta version of Assetbank, an IP distribution service focused on NFTs.    On the AnimeJapan show floor last weekend, animation studio Gonzo promoted its ""SAMURAI cryptos"" blockchain/NFT project at its booth. Gonzo president Shinichiro Ichikawa said that the project will create ""a new era of animation for the NFT era with Japanese samurai,"" and will focus on the keywords ""Cypher,"" ""Decentral,"" and ""Solidarity."" The project will feature designs by Makoto Kobayashi (Last Exile, Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ), Michinori Chiba (Basilisk, Sk8 the Infinity), and Hiroya Iijima (Afro Samurai, Mazinger Z: Infinity).

Interest avex Highlights Success of Muv-Luv Alternative NFTs   posted on 2022-04-01 00:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy          GONZO also promotes ""SAMURAI cryptos"" blockchain/NFT project at AnimeJapan booth    Asahi Iwanaga, Representative Director of Avex Technologies, Inc., highlighted the success of the Muv-Luv Alternative anime's NFT project in a business seminar at AnimeJapan on Monday. 11,115 Keyframe Card packs were sold, averaging 38,448 yen (approximately US$315) per sale.    The Muv-Luve Alternative franchise partnered with the Sakura Gate tech company last October to launch a Keyframe Card service featuring key animation frames from the anime. Although the Keyframe Cards will not have NFT functionality at launch, they will be added later as a means to incentivize owners to buy and trade cards on the NFT marketplace. Note that owning the Keyframe Card of a scene is not equivalent to owning the copyright, which is retained by the original IP holders.    As an extra incentive for the fans, those who bought a certain number of cards had their names listed in the credits of the Muv-Luv Alternative Blu-ray Box and the accompanying booklet. The sets shipped in January and March.    Iwanaga described the cards as an effective product to target a small audience of ""core"" fans, who are interested in NFTs but lack the means to engage with them. He said that in the anime world, NFTs can be used to further monetize an IP by selling them as a limited-edition collector's item.    Nevertheless, he recognized the challenges of implementing NFTs, pointing to the proliferation of unauthorized NFTs on OpenSea. He also clarified the distinction between digital ownership and copyright, and recommended that companies get in contact with a specialist in IP law before investing in NFTs. In particular, care must be taken so that the original rights holders can continue to profit even after customers sell their NFTs to other people. He said that this can be done be selling NFTs directly to the consumer first, rather than putting them on an open marketplace.    Avex Technologies launched a blockchain service in 2019 to prove ownership of digital property. In April 2021, the company launched a beta version of Assetbank, an IP distribution service focused on NFTs.    On the AnimeJapan show floor last weekend, animation studio Gonzo promoted its ""SAMURAI cryptos"" blockchain/NFT project at its booth. Gonzo president Shinichiro Ichikawa said that the project will create ""a new era of animation for the NFT era with Japanese samurai,"" and will focus on the keywords ""Cypher,"" ""Decentral,"" and ""Solidarity."" The project will feature designs by Makoto Kobayashi (Last Exile, Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ), Michinori Chiba (Basilisk, Sk8 the Infinity), and Hiroya Iijima (Afro Samurai, Mazinger Z: Infinity).

The Muv-Luve Alternative franchise partnered with the Sakura Gate tech company last October to launch a Keyframe Card service featuring key animation frames from the anime. Although the Keyframe Cards will not have NFT functionality at launch, they will be added later as a means to incentivize owners to buy and trade cards on the NFT marketplace. Note that owning the Keyframe Card of a scene is not equivalent to owning the copyright, which is retained by the original IP holders.    As an extra incentive for the fans, those who bought a certain number of cards had their names listed in the credits of the Muv-Luv Alternative Blu-ray Box and the accompanying booklet. The sets shipped in January and March.    Iwanaga described the cards as an effective product to target a small audience of ""core"" fans, who are interested in NFTs but lack the means to engage with them. He said that in the anime world, NFTs can be used to further monetize an IP by selling them as a limited-edition collector's item.    Nevertheless, he recognized the challenges of implementing NFTs, pointing to the proliferation of unauthorized NFTs on OpenSea. He also clarified the distinction between digital ownership and copyright, and recommended that companies get in contact with a specialist in IP law before investing in NFTs. In particular, care must be taken so that the original rights holders can continue to profit even after customers sell their NFTs to other people. He said that this can be done be selling NFTs directly to the consumer first, rather than putting them on an open marketplace.    Avex Technologies launched a blockchain service in 2019 to prove ownership of digital property. In April 2021, the company launched a beta version of Assetbank, an IP distribution service focused on NFTs.    On the AnimeJapan show floor last weekend, animation studio Gonzo promoted its ""SAMURAI cryptos"" blockchain/NFT project at its booth.

The Muv-Luve Alternative franchise partnered with the Sakura Gate tech company last October to launch a Keyframe Card service featuring key animation frames from the anime. Although the Keyframe Cards will not have NFT functionality at launch, they will be added later as a means to incentivize owners to buy and trade cards on the NFT marketplace. Note that owning the Keyframe Card of a scene is not equivalent to owning the copyright, which is retained by the original IP holders.    As an extra incentive for the fans, those who bought a certain number of cards had their names listed in the credits of the Muv-Luv Alternative Blu-ray Box and the accompanying booklet. The sets shipped in January and March.    Iwanaga described the cards as an effective product to target a small audience of ""core"" fans, who are interested in NFTs but lack the means to engage with them. He said that in the anime world, NFTs can be used to further monetize an IP by selling them as a limited-edition collector's item.    Nevertheless, he recognized the challenges of implementing NFTs, pointing to the proliferation of unauthorized NFTs on OpenSea. He also clarified the distinction between digital ownership and copyright, and recommended that companies get in contact with a specialist in IP law before investing in NFTs. In particular, care must be taken so that the original rights holders can continue to profit even after customers sell their NFTs to other people. He said that this can be done be selling NFTs directly to the consumer first, rather than putting them on an open marketplace.    Avex Technologies launched a blockchain service in 2019 to prove ownership of digital property. In April 2021, the company launched a beta version of Assetbank, an IP distribution service focused on NFTs.

My Dress-Up Darling Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 28th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of My Dress-Up Darling ?                     Community score: 4.7            Because the fanservice and the cosplay insights are oftentimes My Dress-Up Darling's biggest attention grabbers – as well as being some of the primary elements the show is marketed on – I was genuinely shocked when it decided to end on a note that embraces neither of those things. Instead, this episode cements My Dress-Up Darling as a romance about two characters coming into their own all along, and while I think the show could have definitely made this more of a focus earlier on, it still makes for one of the best season finales one could hope for.    In terms of narrative progression, there's not a lot that goes on in this episode. We don't really see a lot of the other characters we got introduced to outside of the main duo, and cosplay is barely even mentioned aside from one or two small conversation points (my favorite is the scene towards the beginning where Gojo isn't affected by a horror movie because he's focusing so hard on things like the makeup and costume design). This is just an episode about Gojo and Kitagawa living out the last days of their summer break, spending time together and fortifying the foundation of their relationship that has been slowly building up to this point. We get scenes of Kitagawa getting in over her head and needing to rely on Gojo to help keep her steady, and it's clear that Gojo appreciates Kitagawa for taking him out to experience things that he never really got the chance to. It's not like there was really anything stopping him from experiencing these things on his own, but this boy had grown to be so accepting of his loneliness due to his childhood trauma that he probably just came to his own conclusion that he could never be a part of social gatherings like that. So Kitagawa not only going with him to the festival but also casually bringing up that they will do more things together next year means the world to him, and those quiet moments where he's just staring off into the scenery or appreciating the beautiful ball of energy that steamrolled into his life genuinely moved me.    A couple reviews ago I mentioned how I almost didn't want these two to get together too quickly despite Kitagawa realizing her feelings for Gojo early on, as I think the characters needed to come to terms with how they view themselves before they would be ready to commit to something like a romantic relationship. This episode was definitely a step in that direction as Gojo begins to further appreciate and accept the fact that he does not need to be alone anymore while Kitagawa continues to rely on Gojo as a source of support and understanding. I love these two characters and I look forward to the day when I might be able to see them come together as equals. Despite all of the unabashed horniness and some questionable and borderline problematic practices the show touches upon, you will never convince me that My Dress Up Darling doesn't have a heart. It might take some time to get it, and some might feel like it's not worth trying to find in the first place, but that heart was strong enough to carry me all the way to the end of the show and also consider it one of the better slice of life anime that I've seen in a bit.    Rating:                 My Dress-Up Darling is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.   <prevEpisode 1-2 Episode 3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episode 6 Episode 7 Episode 8 Episode 9 Episode 10 Episode 11 Episode 12     discuss this in the forum (341 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to My Dress-Up Darling Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

My Dress-Up Darling Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 28th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of My Dress-Up Darling ?                     Community score: 4.7            Because the fanservice and the cosplay insights are oftentimes My Dress-Up Darling's biggest attention grabbers – as well as being some of the primary elements the show is marketed on – I was genuinely shocked when it decided to end on a note that embraces neither of those things. Instead, this episode cements My Dress-Up Darling as a romance about two characters coming into their own all along, and while I think the show could have definitely made this more of a focus earlier on, it still makes for one of the best season finales one could hope for.    In terms of narrative progression, there's not a lot that goes on in this episode. We don't really see a lot of the other characters we got introduced to outside of the main duo, and cosplay is barely even mentioned aside from one or two small conversation points (my favorite is the scene towards the beginning where Gojo isn't affected by a horror movie because he's focusing so hard on things like the makeup and costume design). This is just an episode about Gojo and Kitagawa living out the last days of their summer break, spending time together and fortifying the foundation of their relationship that has been slowly building up to this point. We get scenes of Kitagawa getting in over her head and needing to rely on Gojo to help keep her steady, and it's clear that Gojo appreciates Kitagawa for taking him out to experience things that he never really got the chance to. It's not like there was really anything stopping him from experiencing these things on his own, but this boy had grown to be so accepting of his loneliness due to his childhood trauma that he probably just came to his own conclusion that he could never be a part of social gatherings like that. So Kitagawa not only going with him to the festival but also casually bringing up that they will do more things together next year means the world to him, and those quiet moments where he's just staring off into the scenery or appreciating the beautiful ball of energy that steamrolled into his life genuinely moved me.    A couple reviews ago I mentioned how I almost didn't want these two to get together too quickly despite Kitagawa realizing her feelings for Gojo early on, as I think the characters needed to come to terms with how they view themselves before they would be ready to commit to something like a romantic relationship. This episode was definitely a step in that direction as Gojo begins to further appreciate and accept the fact that he does not need to be alone anymore while Kitagawa continues to rely on Gojo as a source of support and understanding. I love these two characters and I look forward to the day when I might be able to see them come together as equals. Despite all of the unabashed horniness and some questionable and borderline problematic practices the show touches upon, you will never convince me that My Dress Up Darling doesn't have a heart. It might take some time to get it, and some might feel like it's not worth trying to find in the first place, but that heart was strong enough to carry me all the way to the end of the show and also consider it one of the better slice of life anime that I've seen in a bit.    Rating:                 My Dress-Up Darling is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.   <prevEpisode 1-2 Episode 3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episode 6 Episode 7 Episode 8 Episode 9 Episode 10 Episode 11 Episode 12     discuss this in the forum (341 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to My Dress-Up Darling Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

We get scenes of Kitagawa getting in over her head and needing to rely on Gojo to help keep her steady, and it's clear that Gojo appreciates Kitagawa for taking him out to experience things that he never really got the chance to. It's not like there was really anything stopping him from experiencing these things on his own, but this boy had grown to be so accepting of his loneliness due to his childhood trauma that he probably just came to his own conclusion that he could never be a part of social gatherings like that. So Kitagawa not only going with him to the festival but also casually bringing up that they will do more things together next year means the world to him, and those quiet moments where he's just staring off into the scenery or appreciating the beautiful ball of energy that steamrolled into his life genuinely moved me.    A couple reviews ago I mentioned how I almost didn't want these two to get together too quickly despite Kitagawa realizing her feelings for Gojo early on, as I think the characters needed to come to terms with how they view themselves before they would be ready to commit to something like a romantic relationship. This episode was definitely a step in that direction as Gojo begins to further appreciate and accept the fact that he does not need to be alone anymore while Kitagawa continues to rely on Gojo as a source of support and understanding. I love these two characters and I look forward to the day when I might be able to see them come together as equals. Despite all of the unabashed horniness and some questionable and borderline problematic practices the show touches upon, you will never convince me that My Dress Up Darling doesn't have a heart. It might take some time to get it, and some might feel like it's not worth trying to find in the first place, but that heart was strong enough to carry me all the way to the end of the show and also consider it one of the better slice of life anime that I've seen in a bit.

My Dress-Up Darling Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 28th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of My Dress-Up Darling ?                     Community score: 4.7            Because the fanservice and the cosplay insights are oftentimes My Dress-Up Darling's biggest attention grabbers – as well as being some of the primary elements the show is marketed on – I was genuinely shocked when it decided to end on a note that embraces neither of those things. Instead, this episode cements My Dress-Up Darling as a romance about two characters coming into their own all along, and while I think the show could have definitely made this more of a focus earlier on, it still makes for one of the best season finales one could hope for.    In terms of narrative progression, there's not a lot that goes on in this episode. We don't really see a lot of the other characters we got introduced to outside of the main duo, and cosplay is barely even mentioned aside from one or two small conversation points (my favorite is the scene towards the beginning where Gojo isn't affected by a horror movie because he's focusing so hard on things like the makeup and costume design). This is just an episode about Gojo and Kitagawa living out the last days of their summer break, spending time together and fortifying the foundation of their relationship that has been slowly building up to this point. We get scenes of Kitagawa getting in over her head and needing to rely on Gojo to help keep her steady, and it's clear that Gojo appreciates Kitagawa for taking him out to experience things that he never really got the chance to. It's not like there was really anything stopping him from experiencing these things on his own, but this boy had grown to be so accepting of his loneliness due to his childhood trauma that he probably just came to his own conclusion that he could never be a part of social gatherings like that. So Kitagawa not only going with him to the festival but also casually bringing up that they will do more things together next year means the world to him, and those quiet moments where he's just staring off into the scenery or appreciating the beautiful ball of energy that steamrolled into his life genuinely moved me.    A couple reviews ago I mentioned how I almost didn't want these two to get together too quickly despite Kitagawa realizing her feelings for Gojo early on, as I think the characters needed to come to terms with how they view themselves before they would be ready to commit to something like a romantic relationship. This episode was definitely a step in that direction as Gojo begins to further appreciate and accept the fact that he does not need to be alone anymore while Kitagawa continues to rely on Gojo as a source of support and understanding. I love these two characters and I look forward to the day when I might be able to see them come together as equals.

My Dress-Up Darling Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 28th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of My Dress-Up Darling ?                     Community score: 4.7            Because the fanservice and the cosplay insights are oftentimes My Dress-Up Darling's biggest attention grabbers – as well as being some of the primary elements the show is marketed on – I was genuinely shocked when it decided to end on a note that embraces neither of those things. Instead, this episode cements My Dress-Up Darling as a romance about two characters coming into their own all along, and while I think the show could have definitely made this more of a focus earlier on, it still makes for one of the best season finales one could hope for.    In terms of narrative progression, there's not a lot that goes on in this episode. We don't really see a lot of the other characters we got introduced to outside of the main duo, and cosplay is barely even mentioned aside from one or two small conversation points (my favorite is the scene towards the beginning where Gojo isn't affected by a horror movie because he's focusing so hard on things like the makeup and costume design). This is just an episode about Gojo and Kitagawa living out the last days of their summer break, spending time together and fortifying the foundation of their relationship that has been slowly building up to this point. We get scenes of Kitagawa getting in over her head and needing to rely on Gojo to help keep her steady, and it's clear that Gojo appreciates Kitagawa for taking him out to experience things that he never really got the chance to. It's not like there was really anything stopping him from experiencing these things on his own, but this boy had grown to be so accepting of his loneliness due to his childhood trauma that he probably just came to his own conclusion that he could never be a part of social gatherings like that. So Kitagawa not only going with him to the festival but also casually bringing up that they will do more things together next year means the world to him, and those quiet moments where he's just staring off into the scenery or appreciating the beautiful ball of energy that steamrolled into his life genuinely moved me.    A couple reviews ago I mentioned how I almost didn't want these two to get together too quickly despite Kitagawa realizing her feelings for Gojo early on, as I think the characters needed to come to terms with how they view themselves before they would be ready to commit to something like a romantic relationship. This episode was definitely a step in that direction as Gojo begins to further appreciate and accept the fact that he does not need to be alone anymore while Kitagawa continues to rely on Gojo as a source of support and understanding. I love these two characters and I look forward to the day when I might be able to see them come together as equals. Despite all of the unabashed horniness and some questionable and borderline problematic practices the show touches upon, you will never convince me that My Dress Up Darling doesn't have a heart. It might take some time to get it, and some might feel like it's not worth trying to find in the first place, but that heart was strong enough to carry me all the way to the end of the show and also consider it one of the better slice of life anime that I've seen in a bit.

REVIEW: Case Study of Vanitas Season 2            Goto page 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6  Next Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        tintor2    Joined: 11 Aug 2010 		    Posts: 972       Posted: Mon Jan 24, 2022 8:51 pm            Man. Astolfo is scary. The new opening is neat but they gotta show Murr more.   Didn't remember the sex appeal in this series like that. Jeanne's ""medical"" treatment towards Vanitas was more obvious than the innuendo jokes from Black Butler. Still, the way Jeanne reacts to her own actions sure was strange. At first it seemed like the opposite of how they met when Vanitas kissed her suddenly.

I thought they were going to spend at least an episode having to go and ask around town for clues and such. On top of that, everything else that happened like Astolfo showing up, Vanitas losing the Book, them actually meeting Chloe... all things I didn't think we'd get this early on. Almost too much happened to really talk about in depth.   Chloe also seems super interesting to me. At first glance in Ep 1 she really gave me ""Claudia from Interview With the Vampire"" vibes due to her very young appearance despite her age (and even things like asking her Jean-Jacques to carry her), but it seems like that initial comparison was entirely superficial by Ep 2. We know she's probably pretty damn powerful if she's older than Ruthven and seems pretty much in control of everything. Even Naenia seems to be more of a partner rather than a predator. As the review said, I agree she probably knows feeding on Noe without asking is wrong, she's just doesn't care at this point.   Also just as an aside, while the review automatically assumes Chloe is the Beast in question (and to be fair, I totally did too), I'm not entirely convinced given that single shot of Jean-Jaques walking towards her after picking up the book with his blood dripping down. I know she said her leg hurt too much to walk afterwards and we know she's afflicted with something (if not just the Beast and I'm overthinking it) since Naenia's been with her, so maybe either her true malnomen is something else that's more hidden?    tintor2 wrote:    Still, the way Jeanne reacts to her own actions sure was strange. At first it seemed like the opposite of how they met when Vanitas kissed her suddenly.           I will say I actually did appreciate Vanitas and Jeanne's little cabin moment if only because it switched things up a bit with their dynamic, and it's not just him endlessly teasing her. Regarding Jeanne's actions, I think I remember someone last season during their date episode talking about how she is probably pretty weak to any sort of kindness since as a bourreau, she probably wasn't shown that much in her life... which would explain a lot of why her feelings towards him seem super all over the place/confusing to her/a switch up from their first couple interactions. It will be really interesting to see where they go because honestly I have no clue, literally everyone in this show seems to have chemistry with everyone else haha      Back to top                  wolf10    Joined: 23 Jan 2016 		    Posts: 676       Posted: Mon Jan 24, 2022 9:26 pm              Quote:    It's an eventful start to the second half of the story, so grab your wolf repellant and hang on.          Wolf repellant failed. I am here, and I brought a really big spoon.   No idea where any of this is going, but it's not hard to guess a malnoumen is responsible for the apparent time travel, and it's probably valuable enough to earn a stay of execution from whichever side gets control of it. There may even be two in play, if Jean-Jacques is a vampire. (He looks a little young to be ~56-year-old Rousseau, but this is also the series that just casually dropped a Dr. Moreau into the setting with no explanation whatsoever.)

Feels pretty important given how many times they featured his ear both before and after.            I think he took off the earring because it's a rather big chunk of metal. Which conducts cold and Vanitas has shown to be very sensitive to low temperatures. I don't think this is explicitly said anywhere but it's a very reasonable explanation and the most likely one.

Also, the way it was handled makes it seem more significant than just that.  If it were only about the cold, they could've shown him (or Jeanne) removing his jewelry with a brief comment to that effect and been done with it.  Instead we had about half a dozen closeup shots of his ear with jewelry, plus some nice detail shots of the earring itself, and later several more with his naked piercing practically screaming ""Notice me, sempai!""    Btw, those automated instruments (or whatever they were) were really something, eh?

I'm thinking right now that the important thing is the idea of time: his earring is an hourglass, they've gone back in time, Chloe doesn't age, etc. But the loss of his book may also be a factor - maybe he didn't so much take them off as they vanished when the book was taken away. The earring's color certainly could be linked to the book. But whatever it is, I agree it's significant that we saw the piercing so obviously and I was so busy trying not to repeat myself from Preview Guide that I forgot to mention it.

It happened considerably later, sometime during the night with Jeanne, or in the morning before she woke up and came outside.   I hate to admit I'd never noticed until this episode that he also wears a stud in his right earlobe.  We don't see that the next day either, but there's not a clear enough shot of his earlobe to tell if the stud is missing too.

No, really....isn't it funny how a series that isn't even smut ends up with scenes that are 100 times sexier than the most pandering smut out there!?   Shirtless, feverish, vulnerable Vanitas....and we also got to see him blush from embarrassment for the first time ever.    God Bless This Blessed Day. I am so happy.

The whole ""metal being extra cold on the skin"" is smart but so specific I feel like they would have actually called attention to it if the case.            I should note that in the original magazine printing of the chapter, Mochizuki actually drew Vanitas with the earring on, but in the Tankōbon release, he had it off.   Which, I'm not sure what that means, it could be she simply forgot that he was supposed to have it off originally, or perhaps she liked the idea of him taking it off in a cold environment and sneakily removed it, which also explains why there wasn't any explicit attention drawn to it if she only thought of it after the initial release.

EVERYONE in this show is so freaking attractive....coupled with Bone's exquisite production values...basically makes every episode a treat to watch, honestly.   Still don't like the new ED song meh.

Astolfo is scary. The new opening is neat but they gotta show Murr more.   Didn't remember the sex appeal in this series like that. Jeanne's ""medical"" treatment towards Vanitas was more obvious than the innuendo jokes from Black Butler. Still, the way Jeanne reacts to her own actions sure was strange. At first it seemed like the opposite of how they met when Vanitas kissed her suddenly.      Back to top                  KitKat1721    Joined: 03 Feb 2015 		    Posts: 685       Posted: Mon Jan 24, 2022 9:02 pm            Okay, I 100% expected the new cour to be a bit more drawn out with the mystery element and them actually finding the Beast but lol it just shows up halfway through the premiere haha. I thought they were going to spend at least an episode having to go and ask around town for clues and such. On top of that, everything else that happened like Astolfo showing up, Vanitas losing the Book, them actually meeting Chloe... all things I didn't think we'd get this early on. Almost too much happened to really talk about in depth.   Chloe also seems super interesting to me. At first glance in Ep 1 she really gave me ""Claudia from Interview With the Vampire"" vibes due to her very young appearance despite her age (and even things like asking her Jean-Jacques to carry her), but it seems like that initial comparison was entirely superficial by Ep 2. We know she's probably pretty damn powerful if she's older than Ruthven and seems pretty much in control of everything. Even Naenia seems to be more of a partner rather than a predator. As the review said, I agree she probably knows feeding on Noe without asking is wrong, she's just doesn't care at this point.   Also just as an aside, while the review automatically assumes Chloe is the Beast in question (and to be fair, I totally did too), I'm not entirely convinced given that single shot of Jean-Jaques walking towards her after picking up the book with his blood dripping down. I know she said her leg hurt too much to walk afterwards and we know she's afflicted with something (if not just the Beast and I'm overthinking it) since Naenia's been with her, so maybe either her true malnomen is something else that's more hidden?    tintor2 wrote:    Still, the way Jeanne reacts to her own actions sure was strange. At first it seemed like the opposite of how they met when Vanitas kissed her suddenly.           I will say I actually did appreciate Vanitas and Jeanne's little cabin moment if only because it switched things up a bit with their dynamic, and it's not just him endlessly teasing her. Regarding Jeanne's actions, I think I remember someone last season during their date episode talking about how she is probably pretty weak to any sort of kindness since as a bourreau, she probably wasn't shown that much in her life... which would explain a lot of why her feelings towards him seem super all over the place/confusing to her/a switch up from their first couple interactions. It will be really interesting to see where they go because honestly I have no clue, literally everyone in this show seems to have chemistry with everyone else haha      Back to top                  wolf10    Joined: 23 Jan 2016 		    Posts: 676       Posted: Mon Jan 24, 2022 9:26 pm              Quote:    It's an eventful start to the second half of the story, so grab your wolf repellant and hang on.          Wolf repellant failed. I am here, and I brought a really big spoon.   No idea where any of this is going, but it's not hard to guess a malnoumen is responsible for the apparent time travel, and it's probably valuable enough to earn a stay of execution from whichever side gets control of it. There may even be two in play, if Jean-Jacques is a vampire. (He looks a little young to be ~56-year-old Rousseau, but this is also the series that just casually dropped a Dr. Moreau into the setting with no explanation whatsoever.)

What became of Vanitas' earring and cuffs?  Did Jeanne take them (why?), or did he remove them himself (why?)?  Feels pretty important given how many times they featured his ear both before and after.

Feels pretty important given how many times they featured his ear both before and after.            I think he took off the earring because it's a rather big chunk of metal. Which conducts cold and Vanitas has shown to be very sensitive to low temperatures. I don't think this is explicitly said anywhere but it's a very reasonable explanation and the most likely one.

Also, the way it was handled makes it seem more significant than just that.  If it were only about the cold, they could've shown him (or Jeanne) removing his jewelry with a brief comment to that effect and been done with it.  Instead we had about half a dozen closeup shots of his ear with jewelry, plus some nice detail shots of the earring itself, and later several more with his naked piercing practically screaming ""Notice me, sempai!""    Btw, those automated instruments (or whatever they were) were really something, eh?

I'm thinking right now that the important thing is the idea of time: his earring is an hourglass, they've gone back in time, Chloe doesn't age, etc. But the loss of his book may also be a factor - maybe he didn't so much take them off as they vanished when the book was taken away. The earring's color certainly could be linked to the book. But whatever it is, I agree it's significant that we saw the piercing so obviously and I was so busy trying not to repeat myself from Preview Guide that I forgot to mention it.

It happened considerably later, sometime during the night with Jeanne, or in the morning before she woke up and came outside.   I hate to admit I'd never noticed until this episode that he also wears a stud in his right earlobe.  We don't see that the next day either, but there's not a clear enough shot of his earlobe to tell if the stud is missing too.

No, really....isn't it funny how a series that isn't even smut ends up with scenes that are 100 times sexier than the most pandering smut out there!?   Shirtless, feverish, vulnerable Vanitas....and we also got to see him blush from embarrassment for the first time ever.    God Bless This Blessed Day. I am so happy.

The whole ""metal being extra cold on the skin"" is smart but so specific I feel like they would have actually called attention to it if the case.            I should note that in the original magazine printing of the chapter, Mochizuki actually drew Vanitas with the earring on, but in the Tankōbon release, he had it off.   Which, I'm not sure what that means, it could be she simply forgot that he was supposed to have it off originally, or perhaps she liked the idea of him taking it off in a cold environment and sneakily removed it, which also explains why there wasn't any explicit attention drawn to it if she only thought of it after the initial release.

Yeah....15....pretty mad Best Character got like 30 seconds of screentime...but Chloe's flashback with little Jeanne was cute.   EVERYONE in this show is so freaking attractive....coupled with Bone's exquisite production values...basically makes every episode a treat to watch, honestly.   Still don't like the new ED song meh.

Astolfo is scary. The new opening is neat but they gotta show Murr more.   Didn't remember the sex appeal in this series like that. Jeanne's ""medical"" treatment towards Vanitas was more obvious than the innuendo jokes from Black Butler. Still, the way Jeanne reacts to her own actions sure was strange. At first it seemed like the opposite of how they met when Vanitas kissed her suddenly.      Back to top                  KitKat1721    Joined: 03 Feb 2015 		    Posts: 685       Posted: Mon Jan 24, 2022 9:02 pm            Okay, I 100% expected the new cour to be a bit more drawn out with the mystery element and them actually finding the Beast but lol it just shows up halfway through the premiere haha. I thought they were going to spend at least an episode having to go and ask around town for clues and such. On top of that, everything else that happened like Astolfo showing up, Vanitas losing the Book, them actually meeting Chloe... all things I didn't think we'd get this early on. Almost too much happened to really talk about in depth.   Chloe also seems super interesting to me. At first glance in Ep 1 she really gave me ""Claudia from Interview With the Vampire"" vibes due to her very young appearance despite her age (and even things like asking her Jean-Jacques to carry her), but it seems like that initial comparison was entirely superficial by Ep 2. We know she's probably pretty damn powerful if she's older than Ruthven and seems pretty much in control of everything. Even Naenia seems to be more of a partner rather than a predator. As the review said, I agree she probably knows feeding on Noe without asking is wrong, she's just doesn't care at this point.   Also just as an aside, while the review automatically assumes Chloe is the Beast in question (and to be fair, I totally did too), I'm not entirely convinced given that single shot of Jean-Jaques walking towards her after picking up the book with his blood dripping down. I know she said her leg hurt too much to walk afterwards and we know she's afflicted with something (if not just the Beast and I'm overthinking it) since Naenia's been with her, so maybe either her true malnomen is something else that's more hidden?    tintor2 wrote:    Still, the way Jeanne reacts to her own actions sure was strange. At first it seemed like the opposite of how they met when Vanitas kissed her suddenly.           I will say I actually did appreciate Vanitas and Jeanne's little cabin moment if only because it switched things up a bit with their dynamic, and it's not just him endlessly teasing her. Regarding Jeanne's actions, I think I remember someone last season during their date episode talking about how she is probably pretty weak to any sort of kindness since as a bourreau, she probably wasn't shown that much in her life... which would explain a lot of why her feelings towards him seem super all over the place/confusing to her/a switch up from their first couple interactions. It will be really interesting to see where they go because honestly I have no clue, literally everyone in this show seems to have chemistry with everyone else haha      Back to top                  wolf10    Joined: 23 Jan 2016 		    Posts: 676       Posted: Mon Jan 24, 2022 9:26 pm              Quote:    It's an eventful start to the second half of the story, so grab your wolf repellant and hang on.          Wolf repellant failed. I am here, and I brought a really big spoon.   No idea where any of this is going, but it's not hard to guess a malnoumen is responsible for the apparent time travel, and it's probably valuable enough to earn a stay of execution from whichever side gets control of it. There may even be two in play, if Jean-Jacques is a vampire. (He looks a little young to be ~56-year-old Rousseau, but this is also the series that just casually dropped a Dr. Moreau into the setting with no explanation whatsoever.)

Which conducts cold and Vanitas has shown to be very sensitive to low temperatures. I don't think this is explicitly said anywhere but it's a very reasonable explanation and the most likely one.

Also, the way it was handled makes it seem more significant than just that.  If it were only about the cold, they could've shown him (or Jeanne) removing his jewelry with a brief comment to that effect and been done with it.  Instead we had about half a dozen closeup shots of his ear with jewelry, plus some nice detail shots of the earring itself, and later several more with his naked piercing practically screaming ""Notice me, sempai!""    Btw, those automated instruments (or whatever they were) were really something, eh?

I'm thinking right now that the important thing is the idea of time: his earring is an hourglass, they've gone back in time, Chloe doesn't age, etc. But the loss of his book may also be a factor - maybe he didn't so much take them off as they vanished when the book was taken away. The earring's color certainly could be linked to the book. But whatever it is, I agree it's significant that we saw the piercing so obviously and I was so busy trying not to repeat myself from Preview Guide that I forgot to mention it.

It happened considerably later, sometime during the night with Jeanne, or in the morning before she woke up and came outside.   I hate to admit I'd never noticed until this episode that he also wears a stud in his right earlobe.  We don't see that the next day either, but there's not a clear enough shot of his earlobe to tell if the stud is missing too.

The whole ""metal being extra cold on the skin"" is smart but so specific I feel like they would have actually called attention to it if the case.            I should note that in the original magazine printing of the chapter, Mochizuki actually drew Vanitas with the earring on, but in the Tankōbon release, he had it off.   Which, I'm not sure what that means, it could be she simply forgot that he was supposed to have it off originally, or perhaps she liked the idea of him taking it off in a cold environment and sneakily removed it, which also explains why there wasn't any explicit attention drawn to it if she only thought of it after the initial release.

Astolfo is scary. The new opening is neat but they gotta show Murr more.   Didn't remember the sex appeal in this series like that. Jeanne's ""medical"" treatment towards Vanitas was more obvious than the innuendo jokes from Black Butler. Still, the way Jeanne reacts to her own actions sure was strange. At first it seemed like the opposite of how they met when Vanitas kissed her suddenly.      Back to top                  KitKat1721    Joined: 03 Feb 2015 		    Posts: 685       Posted: Mon Jan 24, 2022 9:02 pm            Okay, I 100% expected the new cour to be a bit more drawn out with the mystery element and them actually finding the Beast but lol it just shows up halfway through the premiere haha. I thought they were going to spend at least an episode having to go and ask around town for clues and such. On top of that, everything else that happened like Astolfo showing up, Vanitas losing the Book, them actually meeting Chloe... all things I didn't think we'd get this early on. Almost too much happened to really talk about in depth.   Chloe also seems super interesting to me. At first glance in Ep 1 she really gave me ""Claudia from Interview With the Vampire"" vibes due to her very young appearance despite her age (and even things like asking her Jean-Jacques to carry her), but it seems like that initial comparison was entirely superficial by Ep 2. We know she's probably pretty damn powerful if she's older than Ruthven and seems pretty much in control of everything. Even Naenia seems to be more of a partner rather than a predator. As the review said, I agree she probably knows feeding on Noe without asking is wrong, she's just doesn't care at this point.   Also just as an aside, while the review automatically assumes Chloe is the Beast in question (and to be fair, I totally did too), I'm not entirely convinced given that single shot of Jean-Jaques walking towards her after picking up the book with his blood dripping down. I know she said her leg hurt too much to walk afterwards and we know she's afflicted with something (if not just the Beast and I'm overthinking it) since Naenia's been with her, so maybe either her true malnomen is something else that's more hidden?    tintor2 wrote:    Still, the way Jeanne reacts to her own actions sure was strange. At first it seemed like the opposite of how they met when Vanitas kissed her suddenly.           I will say I actually did appreciate Vanitas and Jeanne's little cabin moment if only because it switched things up a bit with their dynamic, and it's not just him endlessly teasing her. Regarding Jeanne's actions, I think I remember someone last season during their date episode talking about how she is probably pretty weak to any sort of kindness since as a bourreau, she probably wasn't shown that much in her life... which would explain a lot of why her feelings towards him seem super all over the place/confusing to her/a switch up from their first couple interactions. It will be really interesting to see where they go because honestly I have no clue, literally everyone in this show seems to have chemistry with everyone else haha      Back to top                  wolf10    Joined: 23 Jan 2016 		    Posts: 676       Posted: Mon Jan 24, 2022 9:26 pm              Quote:    It's an eventful start to the second half of the story, so grab your wolf repellant and hang on.          Wolf repellant failed. I am here, and I brought a really big spoon.   No idea where any of this is going, but it's not hard to guess a malnoumen is responsible for the apparent time travel, and it's probably valuable enough to earn a stay of execution from whichever side gets control of it. There may even be two in play, if Jean-Jacques is a vampire. (He looks a little young to be ~56-year-old Rousseau, but this is also the series that just casually dropped a Dr. Moreau into the setting with no explanation whatsoever.)

Feels pretty important given how many times they featured his ear both before and after.            I think he took off the earring because it's a rather big chunk of metal. Which conducts cold and Vanitas has shown to be very sensitive to low temperatures. I don't think this is explicitly said anywhere but it's a very reasonable explanation and the most likely one.

Also, the way it was handled makes it seem more significant than just that.  If it were only about the cold, they could've shown him (or Jeanne) removing his jewelry with a brief comment to that effect and been done with it.  Instead we had about half a dozen closeup shots of his ear with jewelry, plus some nice detail shots of the earring itself, and later several more with his naked piercing practically screaming ""Notice me, sempai!""    Btw, those automated instruments (or whatever they were) were really something, eh?

I'm thinking right now that the important thing is the idea of time: his earring is an hourglass, they've gone back in time, Chloe doesn't age, etc. But the loss of his book may also be a factor - maybe he didn't so much take them off as they vanished when the book was taken away. The earring's color certainly could be linked to the book. But whatever it is, I agree it's significant that we saw the piercing so obviously and I was so busy trying not to repeat myself from Preview Guide that I forgot to mention it.

It happened considerably later, sometime during the night with Jeanne, or in the morning before she woke up and came outside.   I hate to admit I'd never noticed until this episode that he also wears a stud in his right earlobe.  We don't see that the next day either, but there's not a clear enough shot of his earlobe to tell if the stud is missing too.

No, really....isn't it funny how a series that isn't even smut ends up with scenes that are 100 times sexier than the most pandering smut out there!?

The whole ""metal being extra cold on the skin"" is smart but so specific I feel like they would have actually called attention to it if the case.            I should note that in the original magazine printing of the chapter, Mochizuki actually drew Vanitas with the earring on, but in the Tankōbon release, he had it off.   Which, I'm not sure what that means, it could be she simply forgot that he was supposed to have it off originally, or perhaps she liked the idea of him taking it off in a cold environment and sneakily removed it, which also explains why there wasn't any explicit attention drawn to it if she only thought of it after the initial release.

Does a great job being sexy (surprised there weren't many comments on the sexiness factor since it's an ecchi series). Likable characters too, and a great ending.      Back to top                  dm   Subscriber   Joined: 24 Sep 2010 		    Posts: 952       Posted: Fri Apr 01, 2022 1:15 pm            I pretty much agree with the review.  Viewed uncharitably, the manga starts with a date-rape (the landlord takes advantage of Chiyo's drunken stupor to seduce her), and if she were male it would be unforgivable. I guess I have a bit of a double standard, there.   As the manga goes on, one comes to feel that there's trauma in the landlord's past and I found myself wanting to learn more about her.  Indeed, as the manga goes on, I started to doubt that much happened that first night --- or at least the landlord wishes that were the case --- even though the landlord teases Chiyo about her responses from time to time.   Yes, it walks a delicate line, but so far it succeeds in that for me.

Does a great job being sexy (surprised there weren't many comments on the sexiness factor since it's an ecchi series). Likable characters too, and a great ending.      Back to top                  dm   Subscriber   Joined: 24 Sep 2010 		    Posts: 952       Posted: Fri Apr 01, 2022 1:15 pm            I pretty much agree with the review.  Viewed uncharitably, the manga starts with a date-rape (the landlord takes advantage of Chiyo's drunken stupor to seduce her), and if she were male it would be unforgivable. I guess I have a bit of a double standard, there.   As the manga goes on, one comes to feel that there's trauma in the landlord's past and I found myself wanting to learn more about her.  Indeed, as the manga goes on, I started to doubt that much happened that first night --- or at least the landlord wishes that were the case --- even though the landlord teases Chiyo about her responses from time to time.   Yes, it walks a delicate line, but so far it succeeds in that for me.

Hiranishi posted a video to explain the news (viewers can toggle on the English subtitles for the below video):      Hiranishi explained in the video that she was planning to self-publish the net manga, but publishers approached her instead to publish the work.    Viz Media will publish the manga in English under its ""Viz Originals"" label.    The manga is currently available for free in English to read on such services as Webtoons and Tapas, and in Japanese on pixiv.    Hiranishi originally wrote the semi-autobiographical manga in college, and then more recently redrew the series and posted it online.

News Viz Media to Publish Mieri Hiranishi's The Girl That Can't Get a Girlfriend Manga   posted on 2022-04-02 14:07 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Viz to publish manga under its ""Viz Originals"" label    Manga creator Mieri Hiranishi announced on Friday that Viz Media will publish the English version of her The Girl That Can't Get a Girlfriend (Kanojo ga Denai Onna) manga.    Hiranishi posted a video to explain the news (viewers can toggle on the English subtitles for the below video):      Hiranishi explained in the video that she was planning to self-publish the net manga, but publishers approached her instead to publish the work.    Viz Media will publish the manga in English under its ""Viz Originals"" label.    The manga is currently available for free in English to read on such services as Webtoons and Tapas, and in Japanese on pixiv.    Hiranishi originally wrote the semi-autobiographical manga in college, and then more recently redrew the series and posted it online.

Like, I know that Crunchyroll is going to try to promote themselves as the future of anime streaming, but maybe they should try to avoid blatantly going ""Please allow us to become a literal monopoly"" with their messaging.

Nowadays they usually get Jdrama or movie adaptions.    Which as a big Shojo manga fan I would love to see change.    Also stating the appeal of well-produced romcoms.

You could easily say the same thing about shounen stuff (like battle shounen and the male power fantasy isekai trend). And saying ""you can always find more entertainment"" in shounen makes me feel like you don't like reading about female protagonists which star in most shoujos (most shounens have male protagonists).   I respect that you like what you like, but saying ""most shoujo is less fun than shounen"" just seems to be a rehash of ""it's for girls so therefore it's automatically worse.""    cchigu wrote:    Natsume Yuujinchou is one of a kind, probably my favorite shojo manga, I hope we keep getting the sequels for the anime.

Have you ever wondered what would have happened if Sony had not bought the Crunchyroll?  Instead of the demon slayer s2, my dress-up darling and kaguya-sama s2-s3, we was getting the second season of High Guardian Spice  Former Crunchyroll executives (now fired) invested on American political animation with money they received from their subscribers  Do not forget that funimation was in the fruits basket anime production committee and helped a lot to make this anime  Crunchyroll is helping the anime industry, and is even trying to get anime studios to pay more attention to genres like Shojo that are often overlooked (after Sony's acquisition)  And while streaming services like Netflix, which make billions of dollars, only make cheap CGI anime.  This is not a monopoly, this is a situation where no major streaming service pays attention to the anime industry and just wants to use the anime name.  And the only reason Crunchyroll is now focusing more on the anime industry itself is because it is a subsidiary of a Japanese company (Sony / Aniplex).

All ""shojo anime"" indicates is anime that is made primarily to appeal to the shojo (i.e. ""young woman"") demographic. In appealing to that demographic, though, there are many often-used tropes, concepts, & ideas, because they have been proven to consistently work, which in turn can also make ""shojo anime"" feel like a genre, in & of itself.   It really comes down to how you want to interpret it, and all Crunchyroll was saying was that they'd like to see companies produce more anime that appeals to that demographic, as the few that are getting made have been consistently doing better than expected, which shows that it's a larger demographic than the industry thinks.

First of all, High Guardian Spice isn't political, or at least your interpretation of the word. HGS was just a cartoon that got dealt a really bad hand in terms of both marketing, lack of money, and how CR treated all the staff that worked on it, something that the staff on said show have outright told people point blank multiple times online. Any flaws the show had were the result of CR not allowing the writers to go back and rectify them. The only reason the first initial trailer came out the way it did was that CR had the final say in how the show was marketed, not the creators, which the creators of Onyx Equinox flat-out confirmed. Also, the claim that Crunchyroll used subscribers' money to make HGS is a lie, as several articles confirmed that other companies gave CR funding to invest in both co-productions and original programming, one of which ANN even published on here.

Like, I know that Crunchyroll is going to try to promote themselves as the future of anime streaming, but maybe they should try to avoid blatantly going ""Please allow us to become a literal monopoly"" with their messaging.

I mean, shonen demographic manga are also full of tropes but you can always find more entertainment in them in general compared to shojo manga.           I don't think that's fair. You could easily say the same thing about shounen stuff (like battle shounen and the male power fantasy isekai trend). And saying ""you can always find more entertainment"" in shounen makes me feel like you don't like reading about female protagonists which star in most shoujos (most shounens have male protagonists).   I respect that you like what you like, but saying ""most shoujo is less fun than shounen"" just seems to be a rehash of ""it's for girls so therefore it's automatically worse.""    cchigu wrote:    Natsume Yuujinchou is one of a kind, probably my favorite shojo manga, I hope we keep getting the sequels for the anime.

Instead of the demon slayer s2, my dress-up darling and kaguya-sama s2-s3, we was getting the second season of High Guardian Spice  Former Crunchyroll executives (now fired) invested on American political animation with money they received from their subscribers  Do not forget that funimation was in the fruits basket anime production committee and helped a lot to make this anime  Crunchyroll is helping the anime industry, and is even trying to get anime studios to pay more attention to genres like Shojo that are often overlooked (after Sony's acquisition)  And while streaming services like Netflix, which make billions of dollars, only make cheap CGI anime.  This is not a monopoly, this is a situation where no major streaming service pays attention to the anime industry and just wants to use the anime name.  And the only reason Crunchyroll is now focusing more on the anime industry itself is because it is a subsidiary of a Japanese company (Sony / Aniplex).

All ""shojo anime"" indicates is anime that is made primarily to appeal to the shojo (i.e. ""young woman"") demographic. In appealing to that demographic, though, there are many often-used tropes, concepts, & ideas, because they have been proven to consistently work, which in turn can also make ""shojo anime"" feel like a genre, in & of itself.   It really comes down to how you want to interpret it, and all Crunchyroll was saying was that they'd like to see companies produce more anime that appeals to that demographic, as the few that are getting made have been consistently doing better than expected, which shows that it's a larger demographic than the industry thinks.

First of all, High Guardian Spice isn't political, or at least your interpretation of the word. HGS was just a cartoon that got dealt a really bad hand in terms of both marketing, lack of money, and how CR treated all the staff that worked on it, something that the staff on said show have outright told people point blank multiple times online. Any flaws the show had were the result of CR not allowing the writers to go back and rectify them. The only reason the first initial trailer came out the way it did was that CR had the final say in how the show was marketed, not the creators, which the creators of Onyx Equinox flat-out confirmed. Also, the claim that Crunchyroll used subscribers' money to make HGS is a lie, as several articles confirmed that other companies gave CR funding to invest in both co-productions and original programming, one of which ANN even published on here. Seriously, do your research before going off on tangents like this.

You could easily say the same thing about shounen stuff (like battle shounen and the male power fantasy isekai trend). And saying ""you can always find more entertainment"" in shounen makes me feel like you don't like reading about female protagonists which star in most shoujos (most shounens have male protagonists).   I respect that you like what you like, but saying ""most shoujo is less fun than shounen"" just seems to be a rehash of ""it's for girls so therefore it's automatically worse.""    cchigu wrote:    Natsume Yuujinchou is one of a kind, probably my favorite shojo manga, I hope we keep getting the sequels for the anime.

This is not a monopoly, this is a situation where no major streaming service pays attention to the anime industry and just wants to use the anime name.  And the only reason Crunchyroll is now focusing more on the anime industry itself is because it is a subsidiary of a Japanese company (Sony / Aniplex).

All ""shojo anime"" indicates is anime that is made primarily to appeal to the shojo (i.e. ""young woman"") demographic. In appealing to that demographic, though, there are many often-used tropes, concepts, & ideas, because they have been proven to consistently work, which in turn can also make ""shojo anime"" feel like a genre, in & of itself.   It really comes down to how you want to interpret it, and all Crunchyroll was saying was that they'd like to see companies produce more anime that appeals to that demographic, as the few that are getting made have been consistently doing better than expected, which shows that it's a larger demographic than the industry thinks.

First of all, High Guardian Spice isn't political, or at least your interpretation of the word. HGS was just a cartoon that got dealt a really bad hand in terms of both marketing, lack of money, and how CR treated all the staff that worked on it, something that the staff on said show have outright told people point blank multiple times online. Any flaws the show had were the result of CR not allowing the writers to go back and rectify them. The only reason the first initial trailer came out the way it did was that CR had the final say in how the show was marketed, not the creators, which the creators of Onyx Equinox flat-out confirmed. Also, the claim that Crunchyroll used subscribers' money to make HGS is a lie, as several articles confirmed that other companies gave CR funding to invest in both co-productions and original programming, one of which ANN even published on here. Seriously, do your research before going off on tangents like this.

This is not a monopoly, this is a situation where no major streaming service pays attention to the anime industry and just wants to use the anime name.  And the only reason Crunchyroll is now focusing more on the anime industry itself is because it is a subsidiary of a Japanese company (Sony / Aniplex).

All ""shojo anime"" indicates is anime that is made primarily to appeal to the shojo (i.e. ""young woman"") demographic. In appealing to that demographic, though, there are many often-used tropes, concepts, & ideas, because they have been proven to consistently work, which in turn can also make ""shojo anime"" feel like a genre, in & of itself.   It really comes down to how you want to interpret it, and all Crunchyroll was saying was that they'd like to see companies produce more anime that appeals to that demographic, as the few that are getting made have been consistently doing better than expected, which shows that it's a larger demographic than the industry thinks.

First of all, High Guardian Spice isn't political, or at least your interpretation of the word. HGS was just a cartoon that got dealt a really bad hand in terms of both marketing, lack of money, and how CR treated all the staff that worked on it, something that the staff on said show have outright told people point blank multiple times online. Any flaws the show had were the result of CR not allowing the writers to go back and rectify them. The only reason the first initial trailer came out the way it did was that CR had the final say in how the show was marketed, not the creators, which the creators of Onyx Equinox flat-out confirmed. Also, the claim that Crunchyroll used subscribers' money to make HGS is a lie, as several articles confirmed that other companies gave CR funding to invest in both co-productions and original programming, one of which ANN even published on here. Seriously, do your research before going off on tangents like this.

It really comes down to how you want to interpret it, and all Crunchyroll was saying was that they'd like to see companies produce more anime that appeals to that demographic, as the few that are getting made have been consistently doing better than expected, which shows that it's a larger demographic than the industry thinks.

I mean, shonen demographic manga are also full of tropes but you can always find more entertainment in them in general compared to shojo manga.           I don't think that's fair. You could easily say the same thing about shounen stuff (like battle shounen and the male power fantasy isekai trend). And saying ""you can always find more entertainment"" in shounen makes me feel like you don't like reading about female protagonists which star in most shoujos (most shounens have male protagonists).   I respect that you like what you like, but saying ""most shoujo is less fun than shounen"" just seems to be a rehash of ""it's for girls so therefore it's automatically worse.""    cchigu wrote:    Natsume Yuujinchou is one of a kind, probably my favorite shojo manga, I hope we keep getting the sequels for the anime.
