Tokyo 24th Ward Episode 11  by Christopher Farris, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of Tokyo 24th Ward ?                     Community score: 3.0            One thing I haven't yet made space to mention much regarding Tokyo 24th Ward is how the whole storyline actually feels very video game-y. Specifically it has a lot of the earmarks of the kinds of visual novels Vio Shimokura has experience writing for at Nitroplus. You could see the expositional conversations across the long time-frame of the story being punctuated with more immediate choice-based 'gameplay' in the Asumi-call/Trolley-problem segments, probably facilitated with some gameplay mechanics based off allocating the stats of the RGB boys' specifically-heightened abilities. And this whole stupid thing might have worked better in such a format. Games, after all, have more parameters of action to be judged on than simply digesting the narrative of a story we're getting from the one telling it. Persona 5 ended up having some rather misguided musings on the nature of societal rebellion and the justice system, but it still worked as a video game because it was great fun to play. But alas, Tokyo 24th Ward is not a game like Persona 5, it's an anime like PERSONA 5 the Animation, meaning we're stuck simply having to watch it and judge its story without any interactive flourishes to distract us.    Still, I have to bring such a potentially-mechanical consideration up as this (hopefully) penultimate episode gears up for the story's ending by handing Shu one last plot device and explicitly describing to him the parameters for whatever ending he's trying to reach on this run. Speaking of Shin Megami Tensei spin-offs, I started reviewing this series by wryly referring to Koki and Ran's ends of the story's political spectrum as the 'Law' and 'Chaos' factions, but seeing this fork specifically described to Shu like he's hovering over the final selection button in a game's narrative really drives it home. Except it feels like one of those poorly-considered final decisions foisted on a player for the sake of feeling like an impactful culmination of everything that led them here.    The personal component of Shu's consideration feels like a six-of-one/half-dozen-of-another situation, with the confirmation that Asumi is irrevocably brain-dead and he's just to make the call of putting her consciousness into an everlasting coma, or destroying her existence completely. But even that comes off as seismic in the face of the societal side-effects Shu is supposedly reckoning with in what each choice will mean for the KANAE system. I think this is primarily an issue of how laughably lopsided Tokyo 24th Ward's attempts at 'both sides'-ing this narrative continue to be. It's been repeatedly confirmed that Hazard Cast and the KANAE system are pretty well useless at the job they're supposed to do. But then the unmonitored 'anarchy' of the citizens DoRed has whipped up is presented as an undesirable opposite extreme (which the show, just this episode, hilariously has a faction of 'pro-safety' citizens rise up in counter-protest to). Once again though the series is asking us to ignore that the issues driving the problems of these darn uppity poors was specifically initiated by a manipulative, agenda-driven government and the corporate elites who financed them, with them being the ones with the most vested interest in keeping the KANAE system still going. The best the show can do is continue to throw around the justification that Mayor Gori 'believes' he's doing the right thing, but that point of the narrative has been tainted pretty much from the word go.    So it might actually be for the best that the ideological components of the plot actually seem to have mostly faded with the show reaching this point. That's why the setup with Asumi's consciousness is even present, really, so that Shu has some sort of consideration apart from having to decide how much police-state surveillance is too much. This does upend the plot in other unintentionally-hilarious ways: Chikuwa dramatically reveals to Shu that the formative school fire wasn't arson at all, but was rather the result of an electrical short. This prompts a minutes-long flashback from Shu where he remembers he actually spotted the wire-chewing rats who likely sparked that, resulting in the traumatic realization that if he had…stopped the rats somehow, none of this might have happened! And yes, it's extremely amusing to imagine that Shu was one Tom & Jerry sketch away from putting this whole exercise on a completely different course, but his reflection on the issue winds up glossing over the point that Mayor Gori, you know, fabricated a crime in order to institute his oppressive public surveillance system.    But as has been the case for Tokyo 24th Ward's storytelling, this emphasis on singular, self-focused choices over any reflection on the societal factors that powers them persists. Shu, Koki, and Ran are brought together again by the end of this one to finally hash out their differences for one las RGB team-up, and it ends up being less of a debate on their particular political ideologies, and more of a violent, circular argument where they all profess how sad and stressed out they are to each other. The one part I can appreciate here is both Ran and Koki directly calling Shu out for his wishy-washy, uninformed centrism, but even that gives way to the supposition that since all of them are hesitating in the face of such a big decision, it must mean they're actually 'the same'.    Their resultant decision to work together feels perfunctory even by this show's standards, specifically with some of the mechanics at hand. Koki's access to the KANAE system and Ran's possession of the Di-VA program that can get them in to have a conversation with Asumi in the Digiverse aren't borne out of the inherent skills they'd previously cultivated in their teamwork, they're just plot devices they got handed before the story shoved them over here (in Ran's case, he gets given the Di-VA drive only minutes before heading to the meeting, like the plot itself suddenly realized it had forgotten to set up such an important component). For an even funnier observation, there's the point that those plot devices, plus the CMD given to Shu so he can activate the Endingtron 3000, were all previously held by the trio of adult characters who were instrumental to this current systemic setup. It means that the grown-ups in this story in fact had the components needed to solve this problem themselves, and didn't, instead simply passing things down to the younger generation to take care of it for them. You can almost see the thematic implication the story is going for there, except in this case it makes no sense for the actual plot at hand. It leaves the exercise with that wholly mechanical feeling of picking up items and recollecting the player characters for the final stretch of a video game, except if I was actually playing it, then at least I might be able to pick out some more amusing dialogue options to keep myself entertained.

Tokyo 24th Ward Episode 11  by Christopher Farris, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of Tokyo 24th Ward ?                     Community score: 3.0            One thing I haven't yet made space to mention much regarding Tokyo 24th Ward is how the whole storyline actually feels very video game-y. Specifically it has a lot of the earmarks of the kinds of visual novels Vio Shimokura has experience writing for at Nitroplus. You could see the expositional conversations across the long time-frame of the story being punctuated with more immediate choice-based 'gameplay' in the Asumi-call/Trolley-problem segments, probably facilitated with some gameplay mechanics based off allocating the stats of the RGB boys' specifically-heightened abilities. And this whole stupid thing might have worked better in such a format. Games, after all, have more parameters of action to be judged on than simply digesting the narrative of a story we're getting from the one telling it. Persona 5 ended up having some rather misguided musings on the nature of societal rebellion and the justice system, but it still worked as a video game because it was great fun to play. But alas, Tokyo 24th Ward is not a game like Persona 5, it's an anime like PERSONA 5 the Animation, meaning we're stuck simply having to watch it and judge its story without any interactive flourishes to distract us.    Still, I have to bring such a potentially-mechanical consideration up as this (hopefully) penultimate episode gears up for the story's ending by handing Shu one last plot device and explicitly describing to him the parameters for whatever ending he's trying to reach on this run. Speaking of Shin Megami Tensei spin-offs, I started reviewing this series by wryly referring to Koki and Ran's ends of the story's political spectrum as the 'Law' and 'Chaos' factions, but seeing this fork specifically described to Shu like he's hovering over the final selection button in a game's narrative really drives it home. Except it feels like one of those poorly-considered final decisions foisted on a player for the sake of feeling like an impactful culmination of everything that led them here.    The personal component of Shu's consideration feels like a six-of-one/half-dozen-of-another situation, with the confirmation that Asumi is irrevocably brain-dead and he's just to make the call of putting her consciousness into an everlasting coma, or destroying her existence completely. But even that comes off as seismic in the face of the societal side-effects Shu is supposedly reckoning with in what each choice will mean for the KANAE system. I think this is primarily an issue of how laughably lopsided Tokyo 24th Ward's attempts at 'both sides'-ing this narrative continue to be. It's been repeatedly confirmed that Hazard Cast and the KANAE system are pretty well useless at the job they're supposed to do. But then the unmonitored 'anarchy' of the citizens DoRed has whipped up is presented as an undesirable opposite extreme (which the show, just this episode, hilariously has a faction of 'pro-safety' citizens rise up in counter-protest to). Once again though the series is asking us to ignore that the issues driving the problems of these darn uppity poors was specifically initiated by a manipulative, agenda-driven government and the corporate elites who financed them, with them being the ones with the most vested interest in keeping the KANAE system still going. The best the show can do is continue to throw around the justification that Mayor Gori 'believes' he's doing the right thing, but that point of the narrative has been tainted pretty much from the word go.    So it might actually be for the best that the ideological components of the plot actually seem to have mostly faded with the show reaching this point. That's why the setup with Asumi's consciousness is even present, really, so that Shu has some sort of consideration apart from having to decide how much police-state surveillance is too much. This does upend the plot in other unintentionally-hilarious ways: Chikuwa dramatically reveals to Shu that the formative school fire wasn't arson at all, but was rather the result of an electrical short. This prompts a minutes-long flashback from Shu where he remembers he actually spotted the wire-chewing rats who likely sparked that, resulting in the traumatic realization that if he had…stopped the rats somehow, none of this might have happened! And yes, it's extremely amusing to imagine that Shu was one Tom & Jerry sketch away from putting this whole exercise on a completely different course, but his reflection on the issue winds up glossing over the point that Mayor Gori, you know, fabricated a crime in order to institute his oppressive public surveillance system.    But as has been the case for Tokyo 24th Ward's storytelling, this emphasis on singular, self-focused choices over any reflection on the societal factors that powers them persists. Shu, Koki, and Ran are brought together again by the end of this one to finally hash out their differences for one las RGB team-up, and it ends up being less of a debate on their particular political ideologies, and more of a violent, circular argument where they all profess how sad and stressed out they are to each other. The one part I can appreciate here is both Ran and Koki directly calling Shu out for his wishy-washy, uninformed centrism, but even that gives way to the supposition that since all of them are hesitating in the face of such a big decision, it must mean they're actually 'the same'.    Their resultant decision to work together feels perfunctory even by this show's standards, specifically with some of the mechanics at hand. Koki's access to the KANAE system and Ran's possession of the Di-VA program that can get them in to have a conversation with Asumi in the Digiverse aren't borne out of the inherent skills they'd previously cultivated in their teamwork, they're just plot devices they got handed before the story shoved them over here (in Ran's case, he gets given the Di-VA drive only minutes before heading to the meeting, like the plot itself suddenly realized it had forgotten to set up such an important component). For an even funnier observation, there's the point that those plot devices, plus the CMD given to Shu so he can activate the Endingtron 3000, were all previously held by the trio of adult characters who were instrumental to this current systemic setup. It means that the grown-ups in this story in fact had the components needed to solve this problem themselves, and didn't, instead simply passing things down to the younger generation to take care of it for them. You can almost see the thematic implication the story is going for there, except in this case it makes no sense for the actual plot at hand. It leaves the exercise with that wholly mechanical feeling of picking up items and recollecting the player characters for the final stretch of a video game, except if I was actually playing it, then at least I might be able to pick out some more amusing dialogue options to keep myself entertained.

Tokyo 24th Ward Episode 11  by Christopher Farris, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of Tokyo 24th Ward ?                     Community score: 3.0            One thing I haven't yet made space to mention much regarding Tokyo 24th Ward is how the whole storyline actually feels very video game-y. Specifically it has a lot of the earmarks of the kinds of visual novels Vio Shimokura has experience writing for at Nitroplus. You could see the expositional conversations across the long time-frame of the story being punctuated with more immediate choice-based 'gameplay' in the Asumi-call/Trolley-problem segments, probably facilitated with some gameplay mechanics based off allocating the stats of the RGB boys' specifically-heightened abilities. And this whole stupid thing might have worked better in such a format. Games, after all, have more parameters of action to be judged on than simply digesting the narrative of a story we're getting from the one telling it. Persona 5 ended up having some rather misguided musings on the nature of societal rebellion and the justice system, but it still worked as a video game because it was great fun to play. But alas, Tokyo 24th Ward is not a game like Persona 5, it's an anime like PERSONA 5 the Animation, meaning we're stuck simply having to watch it and judge its story without any interactive flourishes to distract us.    Still, I have to bring such a potentially-mechanical consideration up as this (hopefully) penultimate episode gears up for the story's ending by handing Shu one last plot device and explicitly describing to him the parameters for whatever ending he's trying to reach on this run. Speaking of Shin Megami Tensei spin-offs, I started reviewing this series by wryly referring to Koki and Ran's ends of the story's political spectrum as the 'Law' and 'Chaos' factions, but seeing this fork specifically described to Shu like he's hovering over the final selection button in a game's narrative really drives it home. Except it feels like one of those poorly-considered final decisions foisted on a player for the sake of feeling like an impactful culmination of everything that led them here.    The personal component of Shu's consideration feels like a six-of-one/half-dozen-of-another situation, with the confirmation that Asumi is irrevocably brain-dead and he's just to make the call of putting her consciousness into an everlasting coma, or destroying her existence completely. But even that comes off as seismic in the face of the societal side-effects Shu is supposedly reckoning with in what each choice will mean for the KANAE system. I think this is primarily an issue of how laughably lopsided Tokyo 24th Ward's attempts at 'both sides'-ing this narrative continue to be. It's been repeatedly confirmed that Hazard Cast and the KANAE system are pretty well useless at the job they're supposed to do. But then the unmonitored 'anarchy' of the citizens DoRed has whipped up is presented as an undesirable opposite extreme (which the show, just this episode, hilariously has a faction of 'pro-safety' citizens rise up in counter-protest to). Once again though the series is asking us to ignore that the issues driving the problems of these darn uppity poors was specifically initiated by a manipulative, agenda-driven government and the corporate elites who financed them, with them being the ones with the most vested interest in keeping the KANAE system still going. The best the show can do is continue to throw around the justification that Mayor Gori 'believes' he's doing the right thing, but that point of the narrative has been tainted pretty much from the word go.    So it might actually be for the best that the ideological components of the plot actually seem to have mostly faded with the show reaching this point. That's why the setup with Asumi's consciousness is even present, really, so that Shu has some sort of consideration apart from having to decide how much police-state surveillance is too much. This does upend the plot in other unintentionally-hilarious ways: Chikuwa dramatically reveals to Shu that the formative school fire wasn't arson at all, but was rather the result of an electrical short. This prompts a minutes-long flashback from Shu where he remembers he actually spotted the wire-chewing rats who likely sparked that, resulting in the traumatic realization that if he had…stopped the rats somehow, none of this might have happened! And yes, it's extremely amusing to imagine that Shu was one Tom & Jerry sketch away from putting this whole exercise on a completely different course, but his reflection on the issue winds up glossing over the point that Mayor Gori, you know, fabricated a crime in order to institute his oppressive public surveillance system.    But as has been the case for Tokyo 24th Ward's storytelling, this emphasis on singular, self-focused choices over any reflection on the societal factors that powers them persists. Shu, Koki, and Ran are brought together again by the end of this one to finally hash out their differences for one las RGB team-up, and it ends up being less of a debate on their particular political ideologies, and more of a violent, circular argument where they all profess how sad and stressed out they are to each other. The one part I can appreciate here is both Ran and Koki directly calling Shu out for his wishy-washy, uninformed centrism, but even that gives way to the supposition that since all of them are hesitating in the face of such a big decision, it must mean they're actually 'the same'.    Their resultant decision to work together feels perfunctory even by this show's standards, specifically with some of the mechanics at hand. Koki's access to the KANAE system and Ran's possession of the Di-VA program that can get them in to have a conversation with Asumi in the Digiverse aren't borne out of the inherent skills they'd previously cultivated in their teamwork, they're just plot devices they got handed before the story shoved them over here (in Ran's case, he gets given the Di-VA drive only minutes before heading to the meeting, like the plot itself suddenly realized it had forgotten to set up such an important component). For an even funnier observation, there's the point that those plot devices, plus the CMD given to Shu so he can activate the Endingtron 3000, were all previously held by the trio of adult characters who were instrumental to this current systemic setup. It means that the grown-ups in this story in fact had the components needed to solve this problem themselves, and didn't, instead simply passing things down to the younger generation to take care of it for them. You can almost see the thematic implication the story is going for there, except in this case it makes no sense for the actual plot at hand. It leaves the exercise with that wholly mechanical feeling of picking up items and recollecting the player characters for the final stretch of a video game, except if I was actually playing it, then at least I might be able to pick out some more amusing dialogue options to keep myself entertained.

Tokyo 24th Ward Episode 11  by Christopher Farris, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of Tokyo 24th Ward ?                     Community score: 3.0            One thing I haven't yet made space to mention much regarding Tokyo 24th Ward is how the whole storyline actually feels very video game-y. Specifically it has a lot of the earmarks of the kinds of visual novels Vio Shimokura has experience writing for at Nitroplus. You could see the expositional conversations across the long time-frame of the story being punctuated with more immediate choice-based 'gameplay' in the Asumi-call/Trolley-problem segments, probably facilitated with some gameplay mechanics based off allocating the stats of the RGB boys' specifically-heightened abilities. And this whole stupid thing might have worked better in such a format. Games, after all, have more parameters of action to be judged on than simply digesting the narrative of a story we're getting from the one telling it. Persona 5 ended up having some rather misguided musings on the nature of societal rebellion and the justice system, but it still worked as a video game because it was great fun to play. But alas, Tokyo 24th Ward is not a game like Persona 5, it's an anime like PERSONA 5 the Animation, meaning we're stuck simply having to watch it and judge its story without any interactive flourishes to distract us.    Still, I have to bring such a potentially-mechanical consideration up as this (hopefully) penultimate episode gears up for the story's ending by handing Shu one last plot device and explicitly describing to him the parameters for whatever ending he's trying to reach on this run. Speaking of Shin Megami Tensei spin-offs, I started reviewing this series by wryly referring to Koki and Ran's ends of the story's political spectrum as the 'Law' and 'Chaos' factions, but seeing this fork specifically described to Shu like he's hovering over the final selection button in a game's narrative really drives it home. Except it feels like one of those poorly-considered final decisions foisted on a player for the sake of feeling like an impactful culmination of everything that led them here.    The personal component of Shu's consideration feels like a six-of-one/half-dozen-of-another situation, with the confirmation that Asumi is irrevocably brain-dead and he's just to make the call of putting her consciousness into an everlasting coma, or destroying her existence completely. But even that comes off as seismic in the face of the societal side-effects Shu is supposedly reckoning with in what each choice will mean for the KANAE system. I think this is primarily an issue of how laughably lopsided Tokyo 24th Ward's attempts at 'both sides'-ing this narrative continue to be. It's been repeatedly confirmed that Hazard Cast and the KANAE system are pretty well useless at the job they're supposed to do. But then the unmonitored 'anarchy' of the citizens DoRed has whipped up is presented as an undesirable opposite extreme (which the show, just this episode, hilariously has a faction of 'pro-safety' citizens rise up in counter-protest to). Once again though the series is asking us to ignore that the issues driving the problems of these darn uppity poors was specifically initiated by a manipulative, agenda-driven government and the corporate elites who financed them, with them being the ones with the most vested interest in keeping the KANAE system still going. The best the show can do is continue to throw around the justification that Mayor Gori 'believes' he's doing the right thing, but that point of the narrative has been tainted pretty much from the word go.    So it might actually be for the best that the ideological components of the plot actually seem to have mostly faded with the show reaching this point. That's why the setup with Asumi's consciousness is even present, really, so that Shu has some sort of consideration apart from having to decide how much police-state surveillance is too much. This does upend the plot in other unintentionally-hilarious ways: Chikuwa dramatically reveals to Shu that the formative school fire wasn't arson at all, but was rather the result of an electrical short. This prompts a minutes-long flashback from Shu where he remembers he actually spotted the wire-chewing rats who likely sparked that, resulting in the traumatic realization that if he had…stopped the rats somehow, none of this might have happened! And yes, it's extremely amusing to imagine that Shu was one Tom & Jerry sketch away from putting this whole exercise on a completely different course, but his reflection on the issue winds up glossing over the point that Mayor Gori, you know, fabricated a crime in order to institute his oppressive public surveillance system.    But as has been the case for Tokyo 24th Ward's storytelling, this emphasis on singular, self-focused choices over any reflection on the societal factors that powers them persists. Shu, Koki, and Ran are brought together again by the end of this one to finally hash out their differences for one las RGB team-up, and it ends up being less of a debate on their particular political ideologies, and more of a violent, circular argument where they all profess how sad and stressed out they are to each other. The one part I can appreciate here is both Ran and Koki directly calling Shu out for his wishy-washy, uninformed centrism, but even that gives way to the supposition that since all of them are hesitating in the face of such a big decision, it must mean they're actually 'the same'.    Their resultant decision to work together feels perfunctory even by this show's standards, specifically with some of the mechanics at hand. Koki's access to the KANAE system and Ran's possession of the Di-VA program that can get them in to have a conversation with Asumi in the Digiverse aren't borne out of the inherent skills they'd previously cultivated in their teamwork, they're just plot devices they got handed before the story shoved them over here (in Ran's case, he gets given the Di-VA drive only minutes before heading to the meeting, like the plot itself suddenly realized it had forgotten to set up such an important component). For an even funnier observation, there's the point that those plot devices, plus the CMD given to Shu so he can activate the Endingtron 3000, were all previously held by the trio of adult characters who were instrumental to this current systemic setup. It means that the grown-ups in this story in fact had the components needed to solve this problem themselves, and didn't, instead simply passing things down to the younger generation to take care of it for them. You can almost see the thematic implication the story is going for there, except in this case it makes no sense for the actual plot at hand. It leaves the exercise with that wholly mechanical feeling of picking up items and recollecting the player characters for the final stretch of a video game, except if I was actually playing it, then at least I might be able to pick out some more amusing dialogue options to keep myself entertained.

But even that comes off as seismic in the face of the societal side-effects Shu is supposedly reckoning with in what each choice will mean for the KANAE system. I think this is primarily an issue of how laughably lopsided Tokyo 24th Ward's attempts at 'both sides'-ing this narrative continue to be. It's been repeatedly confirmed that Hazard Cast and the KANAE system are pretty well useless at the job they're supposed to do. But then the unmonitored 'anarchy' of the citizens DoRed has whipped up is presented as an undesirable opposite extreme (which the show, just this episode, hilariously has a faction of 'pro-safety' citizens rise up in counter-protest to). Once again though the series is asking us to ignore that the issues driving the problems of these darn uppity poors was specifically initiated by a manipulative, agenda-driven government and the corporate elites who financed them, with them being the ones with the most vested interest in keeping the KANAE system still going. The best the show can do is continue to throw around the justification that Mayor Gori 'believes' he's doing the right thing, but that point of the narrative has been tainted pretty much from the word go.    So it might actually be for the best that the ideological components of the plot actually seem to have mostly faded with the show reaching this point. That's why the setup with Asumi's consciousness is even present, really, so that Shu has some sort of consideration apart from having to decide how much police-state surveillance is too much. This does upend the plot in other unintentionally-hilarious ways: Chikuwa dramatically reveals to Shu that the formative school fire wasn't arson at all, but was rather the result of an electrical short. This prompts a minutes-long flashback from Shu where he remembers he actually spotted the wire-chewing rats who likely sparked that, resulting in the traumatic realization that if he had…stopped the rats somehow, none of this might have happened! And yes, it's extremely amusing to imagine that Shu was one Tom & Jerry sketch away from putting this whole exercise on a completely different course, but his reflection on the issue winds up glossing over the point that Mayor Gori, you know, fabricated a crime in order to institute his oppressive public surveillance system.    But as has been the case for Tokyo 24th Ward's storytelling, this emphasis on singular, self-focused choices over any reflection on the societal factors that powers them persists. Shu, Koki, and Ran are brought together again by the end of this one to finally hash out their differences for one las RGB team-up, and it ends up being less of a debate on their particular political ideologies, and more of a violent, circular argument where they all profess how sad and stressed out they are to each other. The one part I can appreciate here is both Ran and Koki directly calling Shu out for his wishy-washy, uninformed centrism, but even that gives way to the supposition that since all of them are hesitating in the face of such a big decision, it must mean they're actually 'the same'.    Their resultant decision to work together feels perfunctory even by this show's standards, specifically with some of the mechanics at hand. Koki's access to the KANAE system and Ran's possession of the Di-VA program that can get them in to have a conversation with Asumi in the Digiverse aren't borne out of the inherent skills they'd previously cultivated in their teamwork, they're just plot devices they got handed before the story shoved them over here (in Ran's case, he gets given the Di-VA drive only minutes before heading to the meeting, like the plot itself suddenly realized it had forgotten to set up such an important component). For an even funnier observation, there's the point that those plot devices, plus the CMD given to Shu so he can activate the Endingtron 3000, were all previously held by the trio of adult characters who were instrumental to this current systemic setup. It means that the grown-ups in this story in fact had the components needed to solve this problem themselves, and didn't, instead simply passing things down to the younger generation to take care of it for them. You can almost see the thematic implication the story is going for there, except in this case it makes no sense for the actual plot at hand. It leaves the exercise with that wholly mechanical feeling of picking up items and recollecting the player characters for the final stretch of a video game, except if I was actually playing it, then at least I might be able to pick out some more amusing dialogue options to keep myself entertained.

Community score: 3.0            One thing I haven't yet made space to mention much regarding Tokyo 24th Ward is how the whole storyline actually feels very video game-y. Specifically it has a lot of the earmarks of the kinds of visual novels Vio Shimokura has experience writing for at Nitroplus. You could see the expositional conversations across the long time-frame of the story being punctuated with more immediate choice-based 'gameplay' in the Asumi-call/Trolley-problem segments, probably facilitated with some gameplay mechanics based off allocating the stats of the RGB boys' specifically-heightened abilities. And this whole stupid thing might have worked better in such a format. Games, after all, have more parameters of action to be judged on than simply digesting the narrative of a story we're getting from the one telling it. Persona 5 ended up having some rather misguided musings on the nature of societal rebellion and the justice system, but it still worked as a video game because it was great fun to play. But alas, Tokyo 24th Ward is not a game like Persona 5, it's an anime like PERSONA 5 the Animation, meaning we're stuck simply having to watch it and judge its story without any interactive flourishes to distract us.    Still, I have to bring such a potentially-mechanical consideration up as this (hopefully) penultimate episode gears up for the story's ending by handing Shu one last plot device and explicitly describing to him the parameters for whatever ending he's trying to reach on this run. Speaking of Shin Megami Tensei spin-offs, I started reviewing this series by wryly referring to Koki and Ran's ends of the story's political spectrum as the 'Law' and 'Chaos' factions, but seeing this fork specifically described to Shu like he's hovering over the final selection button in a game's narrative really drives it home.

Shu, Koki, and Ran are brought together again by the end of this one to finally hash out their differences for one las RGB team-up, and it ends up being less of a debate on their particular political ideologies, and more of a violent, circular argument where they all profess how sad and stressed out they are to each other. The one part I can appreciate here is both Ran and Koki directly calling Shu out for his wishy-washy, uninformed centrism, but even that gives way to the supposition that since all of them are hesitating in the face of such a big decision, it must mean they're actually 'the same'.    Their resultant decision to work together feels perfunctory even by this show's standards, specifically with some of the mechanics at hand. Koki's access to the KANAE system and Ran's possession of the Di-VA program that can get them in to have a conversation with Asumi in the Digiverse aren't borne out of the inherent skills they'd previously cultivated in their teamwork, they're just plot devices they got handed before the story shoved them over here (in Ran's case, he gets given the Di-VA drive only minutes before heading to the meeting, like the plot itself suddenly realized it had forgotten to set up such an important component). For an even funnier observation, there's the point that those plot devices, plus the CMD given to Shu so he can activate the Endingtron 3000, were all previously held by the trio of adult characters who were instrumental to this current systemic setup. It means that the grown-ups in this story in fact had the components needed to solve this problem themselves, and didn't, instead simply passing things down to the younger generation to take care of it for them. You can almost see the thematic implication the story is going for there, except in this case it makes no sense for the actual plot at hand. It leaves the exercise with that wholly mechanical feeling of picking up items and recollecting the player characters for the final stretch of a video game, except if I was actually playing it, then at least I might be able to pick out some more amusing dialogue options to keep myself entertained.

03-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/tokyo-24th-ward/episode-11/.184210,Episode 11 - Tokyo 24th Ward - Anime News Network:SEA,"             How would you rate episode 11 of Tokyo 24th Ward ?                     Community score: 3.0            One thing I haven't yet made space to mention much regarding Tokyo 24th Ward is how the whole storyline actually feels very video game-y. Specifically it has a lot of the earmarks of the kinds of visual novels Vio Shimokura has experience writing for at Nitroplus. You could see the expositional conversations across the long time-frame of the story being punctuated with more immediate choice-based 'gameplay' in the Asumi-call/Trolley-problem segments, probably facilitated with some gameplay mechanics based off allocating the stats of the RGB boys' specifically-heightened abilities. And this whole stupid thing might have worked better in such a format. Games, after all, have more parameters of action to be judged on than simply digesting the narrative of a story we're getting from the one telling it. Persona 5 ended up having some rather misguided musings on the nature of societal rebellion and the justice system, but it still worked as a video game because it was great fun to play. But alas, Tokyo 24th Ward is not a game like Persona 5, it's an anime like PERSONA 5 the Animation, meaning we're stuck simply having to watch it and judge its story without any interactive flourishes to distract us.    Still, I have to bring such a potentially-mechanical consideration up as this (hopefully) penultimate episode gears up for the story's ending by handing Shu one last plot device and explicitly describing to him the parameters for whatever ending he's trying to reach on this run. Speaking of Shin Megami Tensei spin-offs, I started reviewing this series by wryly referring to Koki and Ran's ends of the story's political spectrum as the 'Law' and 'Chaos' factions, but seeing this fork specifically described to Shu like he's hovering over the final selection button in a game's narrative really drives it home. Except it feels like one of those poorly-considered final decisions foisted on a player for the sake of feeling like an impactful culmination of everything that led them here.    The personal component of Shu's consideration feels like a six-of-one/half-dozen-of-another situation, with the confirmation that Asumi is irrevocably brain-dead and he's just to make the call of putting her consciousness into an everlasting coma, or destroying her existence completely. But even that comes off as seismic in the face of the societal side-effects Shu is supposedly reckoning with in what each choice will mean for the KANAE system. I think this is primarily an issue of how laughably lopsided Tokyo 24th Ward's attempts at 'both sides'-ing this narrative continue to be. It's been repeatedly confirmed that Hazard Cast and the KANAE system are pretty well useless at the job they're supposed to do. But then the unmonitored 'anarchy' of the citizens DoRed has whipped up is presented as an undesirable opposite extreme (which the show, just this episode, hilariously has a faction of 'pro-safety' citizens rise up in counter-protest to). Once again though the series is asking us to ignore that the issues driving the problems of these darn uppity poors was specifically initiated by a manipulative, agenda-driven government and the corporate elites who financed them, with them being the ones with the most vested interest in keeping the KANAE system still going. The best the show can do is continue to throw around the justification that Mayor Gori 'believes' he's doing the right thing, but that point of the narrative has been tainted pretty much from the word go.    So it might actually be for the best that the ideological components of the plot actually seem to have mostly faded with the show reaching this point. That's why the setup with Asumi's consciousness is even present, really, so that Shu has some sort of consideration apart from having to decide how much police-state surveillance is too much. This does upend the plot in other unintentionally-hilarious ways: Chikuwa dramatically reveals to Shu that the formative school fire wasn't arson at all, but was rather the result of an electrical short. This prompts a minutes-long flashback from Shu where he remembers he actually spotted the wire-chewing rats who likely sparked that, resulting in the traumatic realization that if he had…stopped the rats somehow, none of this might have happened! And yes, it's extremely amusing to imagine that Shu was one Tom & Jerry sketch away from putting this whole exercise on a completely different course, but his reflection on the issue winds up glossing over the point that Mayor Gori, you know, fabricated a crime in order to institute his oppressive public surveillance system.

I think it was the other way around, the way he was leading up to it made it sound like he was doing that (Saying stuff like, 'doing this may cast me out of society/create hardship/etc.') so that's what people were saying was gonna happen.  Which honestly would have been the least surprising reveal ever but then it ended up being this troll.   Such an Ikuni thing to do.

Yeah, with Ikuhara, you can never be entirely sure that this isn't an elaborate joke he is pulling on you. (See Miki's stopwatch contains the secrets of the universe, He wanted to kill Tuxedo Mask, The Penguindrum is a washing machine, etc)   But I'm more than willingly to go all with it serious or not and call him Bonsoir from now on if that is his wish.

In comparison to some of the stuff Gainax put out, his work in comparison is quite normal. FLCL for example was really queer, with robots coming out of peoples heads and a giant iron in the middle of the town.

And then there’s announcing it on Trans Day of Visibility, too.           Still, he didn't come out as trans but as Bonsoir Ikuhara. If he knows that Trans Day of Visibility is a thing (I didn't, until last year) this looks more like a ""har har coming out getit"" joke than anything. If he doesn't, it just looks like what it does, him assuming a new name for whatever reason, with a jokey garnish.      Quote:    Also Ikuhara's works are so infused with queerness that honestly, him actually being queer probably wouldn't be that big of a surprise to a lot of people.           I think it's more like some people really want to claim him as their ""own"", and claiming to know intimate things about about a real person that he never actually disclosed or insinuated, just because they really want them to be true, is frankly quite creepy to me. (And that's beside my own problems with people worshipping Ikuhara as a queer icon.)

The article states that the announcement includes wording that is often associated with coming out.  That invites speculation.   Also Ikuhara's works are so infused with queerness that honestly, him actually being queer probably wouldn't be that big of a surprise to a lot of people.

Yeah, with Ikuhara, you can never be entirely sure that this isn't an elaborate joke he is pulling on you. (See Miki's stopwatch contains the secrets of the universe, He wanted to kill Tuxedo Mask, The Penguindrum is a washing machine, etc)   But I'm more than willingly to go all with it serious or not and call him Bonsoir from now on if that is his wish.

That scene was conceived by the director and one of the actors, who are both gay.  It wasn't a joke, it was an intended metaphor.

In comparison to some of the stuff Gainax put out, his work in comparison is quite normal. FLCL for example was really queer, with robots coming out of peoples heads and a giant iron in the middle of the town.

If he knows that Trans Day of Visibility is a thing (I didn't, until last year) this looks more like a ""har har coming out getit"" joke than anything. If he doesn't, it just looks like what it does, him assuming a new name for whatever reason, with a jokey garnish.      Quote:    Also Ikuhara's works are so infused with queerness that honestly, him actually being queer probably wouldn't be that big of a surprise to a lot of people.           I think it's more like some people really want to claim him as their ""own"", and claiming to know intimate things about about a real person that he never actually disclosed or insinuated, just because they really want them to be true, is frankly quite creepy to me. (And that's beside my own problems with people worshipping Ikuhara as a queer icon.)

Yeah, with Ikuhara, you can never be entirely sure that this isn't an elaborate joke he is pulling on you. (See Miki's stopwatch contains the secrets of the universe, He wanted to kill Tuxedo Mask, The Penguindrum is a washing machine, etc)   But I'm more than willingly to go all with it serious or not and call him Bonsoir from now on if that is his wish.

In comparison to some of the stuff Gainax put out, his work in comparison is quite normal. FLCL for example was really queer, with robots coming out of peoples heads and a giant iron in the middle of the town.

If he knows that Trans Day of Visibility is a thing (I didn't, until last year) this looks more like a ""har har coming out getit"" joke than anything. If he doesn't, it just looks like what it does, him assuming a new name for whatever reason, with a jokey garnish.      Quote:    Also Ikuhara's works are so infused with queerness that honestly, him actually being queer probably wouldn't be that big of a surprise to a lot of people.           I think it's more like some people really want to claim him as their ""own"", and claiming to know intimate things about about a real person that he never actually disclosed or insinuated, just because they really want them to be true, is frankly quite creepy to me. (And that's beside my own problems with people worshipping Ikuhara as a queer icon.)

Yeah, with Ikuhara, you can never be entirely sure that this isn't an elaborate joke he is pulling on you. (See Miki's stopwatch contains the secrets of the universe, He wanted to kill Tuxedo Mask, The Penguindrum is a washing machine, etc)   But I'm more than willingly to go all with it serious or not and call him Bonsoir from now on if that is his wish.

In comparison to some of the stuff Gainax put out, his work in comparison is quite normal. FLCL for example was really queer, with robots coming out of peoples heads and a giant iron in the middle of the town.

If he knows that Trans Day of Visibility is a thing (I didn't, until last year) this looks more like a ""har har coming out getit"" joke than anything. If he doesn't, it just looks like what it does, him assuming a new name for whatever reason, with a jokey garnish.      Quote:    Also Ikuhara's works are so infused with queerness that honestly, him actually being queer probably wouldn't be that big of a surprise to a lot of people.           I think it's more like some people really want to claim him as their ""own"", and claiming to know intimate things about about a real person that he never actually disclosed or insinuated, just because they really want them to be true, is frankly quite creepy to me. (And that's beside my own problems with people worshipping Ikuhara as a queer icon.)

If he knows that Trans Day of Visibility is a thing (I didn't, until last year) this looks more like a ""har har coming out getit"" joke than anything. If he doesn't, it just looks like what it does, him assuming a new name for whatever reason, with a jokey garnish.

I think it's more like some people really want to claim him as their ""own"", and claiming to know intimate things about about a real person that he never actually disclosed or insinuated, just because they really want them to be true, is frankly quite creepy to me. (And that's beside my own problems with people worshipping Ikuhara as a queer icon.)

I think it's more like some people really want to claim him as their ""own"", and claiming to know intimate things about about a real person that he never actually disclosed or insinuated, just because they really want them to be true, is frankly quite creepy to me. (And that's beside my own problems with people worshipping Ikuhara as a queer icon.)

Yeah, with Ikuhara, you can never be entirely sure that this isn't an elaborate joke he is pulling on you. (See Miki's stopwatch contains the secrets of the universe, He wanted to kill Tuxedo Mask, The Penguindrum is a washing machine, etc)   But I'm more than willingly to go all with it serious or not and call him Bonsoir from now on if that is his wish.

In comparison to some of the stuff Gainax put out, his work in comparison is quite normal. FLCL for example was really queer, with robots coming out of peoples heads and a giant iron in the middle of the town.

If he knows that Trans Day of Visibility is a thing (I didn't, until last year) this looks more like a ""har har coming out getit"" joke than anything. If he doesn't, it just looks like what it does, him assuming a new name for whatever reason, with a jokey garnish.      Quote:    Also Ikuhara's works are so infused with queerness that honestly, him actually being queer probably wouldn't be that big of a surprise to a lot of people.           I think it's more like some people really want to claim him as their ""own"", and claiming to know intimate things about about a real person that he never actually disclosed or insinuated, just because they really want them to be true, is frankly quite creepy to me. (And that's beside my own problems with people worshipping Ikuhara as a queer icon.)

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 1.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptation, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, but still, while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes its a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Put together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's good news. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and Ryo feels like a character it won't be hard to get behind. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (38 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 1.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptation, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, but still, while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes its a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Put together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's good news. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and Ryo feels like a character it won't be hard to get behind. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (38 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 1.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptation, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, but still, while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes its a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Put together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's good news. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and Ryo feels like a character it won't be hard to get behind. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (38 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's good news. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and Ryo feels like a character it won't be hard to get behind. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (38 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 1.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptation, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, but still, while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes its a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Put together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.

This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's good news. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and Ryo feels like a character it won't be hard to get behind. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (38 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 1.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptation, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, but still, while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes its a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Put together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems.

We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes its a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Put together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's good news. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and Ryo feels like a character it won't be hard to get behind. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (38 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 1.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptation, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, but still, while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Apr  1st 2022          Adblock+ breaks this page, consider whitelisting ANN   Welcome to Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Preview Guide! Here's how it goes: our team of critics write up their impressions instantly, to be posted here as they go along. Each critic will cover as many shows as they can handle, giving you alternate takes on most every show.    The guide is ongoing, organized by series and updated multiple times a day. Throughout the next week or two, we'll be updating as often as possible with new perspectives on new episodes from our team of critics. New reviews will be posted as soon as they're written, with each critic's name being added to the roster beneath the show's title. Check back a couple of times every day during the guide, and you're likely to see new shows pop up with multiple takes to enjoy!    Please remember that this is a preview guide. It is designed to give you a taste of the first episode of a show with a preliminary opinion and a few thoughts on whether or not the show has potential. These are not intended to be blanket judgments of these series as a whole. All reviews use the same ratings scale: 1-5, with 1 being the lowest.    Click on the survey at the top of each show's page to vote for your personal score and see how other people scored the show!   You can also check out this season's Trailer Watch Party with Lynzee Loveridge, Jacki Jing, and YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement) first impression of the season's shows.

Here's how it goes: our team of critics write up their impressions instantly, to be posted here as they go along. Each critic will cover as many shows as they can handle, giving you alternate takes on most every show.    The guide is ongoing, organized by series and updated multiple times a day. Throughout the next week or two, we'll be updating as often as possible with new perspectives on new episodes from our team of critics. New reviews will be posted as soon as they're written, with each critic's name being added to the roster beneath the show's title. Check back a couple of times every day during the guide, and you're likely to see new shows pop up with multiple takes to enjoy!    Please remember that this is a preview guide. It is designed to give you a taste of the first episode of a show with a preliminary opinion and a few thoughts on whether or not the show has potential. These are not intended to be blanket judgments of these series as a whole. All reviews use the same ratings scale: 1-5, with 1 being the lowest.    Click on the survey at the top of each show's page to vote for your personal score and see how other people scored the show!

This Week in Anime Does Ranking of Kings Nail the Landing?  by Steve Jones & Monique Thomas, Mar 31st 2022           Wit Studio's sweeping fantasy series wrapped up this season. Did it live up to its expectations to be one of the best series of the year?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!

This Week in Anime Does Ranking of Kings Nail the Landing?  by Steve Jones & Monique Thomas, Mar 31st 2022           Wit Studio's sweeping fantasy series wrapped up this season. Did it live up to its expectations to be one of the best series of the year?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!      Have a good one, kid!        discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!

And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!

Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!      Have a good one, kid!        discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

This Week in Anime Does Ranking of Kings Nail the Landing?  by Steve Jones & Monique Thomas, Mar 31st 2022           Wit Studio's sweeping fantasy series wrapped up this season. Did it live up to its expectations to be one of the best series of the year?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action.

Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!

Did it live up to its expectations to be one of the best series of the year?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!

But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!      Have a good one, kid!        discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}
03-04-2022,anime,3,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-anime/2022-03-31/.184203,Does Ranking of Kings Nail the Landing? - This Week in Anime - Anime News Network:SEA,"         Wit Studio's sweeping fantasy series wrapped up this season. Did it live up to its expectations to be one of the best series of the year?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.

Did it live up to its expectations to be one of the best series of the year?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!

Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!      Have a good one, kid!      ",positive,en,{}
03-04-2022,anime,3,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-anime/2022-03-31/.184203,Does Ranking of Kings Nail the Landing? - This Week in Anime - Anime News Network:SEA,"    Wit Studio's sweeping fantasy series wrapped up this season. Did it live up to its expectations to be one of the best series of the year?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.
