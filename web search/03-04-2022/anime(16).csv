Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 Episode 86  by James Beckett, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 86 of Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ?                     Community score: 4.3              “I've been looking for a good time to die.”  “Retrospective” is one of those Attack on Titan episodes that wrestles with the same fundamental paradox that has stymied so many of the war stories that came before it: Is it possible to do justice the horror and tragedy of war if you're also indulging in the bloody spectacle of it all? It's not the first time that AoT has walked the line between grim parable and bombastic entertainment, but this might be the most glaring instance of the show fighting to have its cake and eat it too. For weeks now, we've been watching the human survivors on Paradis come to grips with their own guilt and culpability, and “Traitor” went so far as to devote a full half-hour to drawing out the terrible suspense that Armin and the others felt as it became more and more certain that they'd have to betray and kill their former friends to save the world.  At the same time, Attack on Titan is the anime where soldiers zip around on rocket-powered grappling hooks so they can dual-wield their swords and slice up giant monsters, never mind that they sometimes become those monsters in order to stir up some positively badass giant fights. Sure, at this moment, the tension is high and the line between friend and foe has become hopelessly blurry, but no matter how awful and stomach-churning things get on the battlefield, there's still that ancient, reptilian corner of our brain that isn't ashamed to hoot and holler with approval when our heroes get some real good killing done.  It's like Jean reminds himself as the carnage begins to explode all around him: If they stop to hesitate for even a second, Eren and his Colossal Titans will ruin the world. It's one of those points where the adrenalin rush of combat is allowed to overtake the more sane and reasonable parts of the human brain, and you're allowed to get just a little bit excited about the insanely cool shit that these soldiers are able to accomplish in times of extreme danger. MAPPA's production has been understandably shaky recently, but they pulled out the big guns for this one. It has always been dubiously ethical to revel in all of the bloodshed while still going along with the anime's stridently anti-war perspective for all these years, and that is unlikely to change so long as we have stories about war that strive to entertain its audience while imparting some kind of moral lesson.   At the very least, “Retrospective” features some of the goriest and impressively choreographed action that The Final Season has ever delivered, and every character gets a moment to shine. Conny gets to wreak enough havoc alone that it reminds you of why he graduated in the top ranks of the trainees to begin with, and Hange joins in the fracas as well. Mikasa's showstopping set piece is so over-the-top bloody that it's almost funny, and feels tailor made to serve as a highlight for the innumerable fist-pumping hard-rock AMVs that the fandom will be pumping out for years to come. Falco has an awesome turn as the new Jaw Titan (which I have affectionately dubbed “Chicken Boo”), but our girl Gabi steals the show with yet another one-in-a-million no-scope that shoots Floch right out of the goddamned sky. I doubt the bastard is dead, but I will feel so vindicated if Gabi was the one to finally squash that bug for good.  ”Restrospective” isn't all mindless spectacle, either. Attack on Titan is classy enough to remember that all of this murder and killing isn't actually a good thing, and we get some very powerful character beats to send that message home. Shadis and Magath's last stand is the standout scene of the episode, and it makes perfect sense that these two old dogs would meet for the first time in the final moments of their life. This kind of heroic sacrifice is par for the course when it comes to war stories like AoT, but the old men's final words drive home the themes that the show has been working so hard to cultivate. The suffering and exploitation of children has been at the forefront of Attack on Titan's concerns since Episode 1, and Magath takes one last opportunity to express regret not just for his own bigotry, but for how he drove innocent children into fighting the same hateful wars on his nation's behalf.  Annie mirrors the same sentiment that Shadis and Magath do, right before they blow the hell out of the Jeagerist compound. There has been so much suffering, so much loss, so much needless destruction, and the only way to make any of it worth it would be to ensure that they find a way to stop the war for good. According to Hange, Liberio and Marley are doomed no matter what they do, and while Annie nearly gives up in her grief, she understands that fighting for the future is the only option they have left. It's what Magath and Shadis died for. In all likelihood, it's what Eren will have to die for, too.  Armin and Mikasa aren't able to respond when Annie asks if killing Eren is something that they can live with, but they will have to make their decision soon. With only one more episode (and the inevitable final film/mini-series) to go, our heroes no longer have the luxury of indecision. There's no more time left to waste. The end is here.  Rating:                 Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 Episode 86  by James Beckett, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 86 of Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ?                     Community score: 4.3              “I've been looking for a good time to die.”  “Retrospective” is one of those Attack on Titan episodes that wrestles with the same fundamental paradox that has stymied so many of the war stories that came before it: Is it possible to do justice the horror and tragedy of war if you're also indulging in the bloody spectacle of it all? It's not the first time that AoT has walked the line between grim parable and bombastic entertainment, but this might be the most glaring instance of the show fighting to have its cake and eat it too. For weeks now, we've been watching the human survivors on Paradis come to grips with their own guilt and culpability, and “Traitor” went so far as to devote a full half-hour to drawing out the terrible suspense that Armin and the others felt as it became more and more certain that they'd have to betray and kill their former friends to save the world.  At the same time, Attack on Titan is the anime where soldiers zip around on rocket-powered grappling hooks so they can dual-wield their swords and slice up giant monsters, never mind that they sometimes become those monsters in order to stir up some positively badass giant fights. Sure, at this moment, the tension is high and the line between friend and foe has become hopelessly blurry, but no matter how awful and stomach-churning things get on the battlefield, there's still that ancient, reptilian corner of our brain that isn't ashamed to hoot and holler with approval when our heroes get some real good killing done.  It's like Jean reminds himself as the carnage begins to explode all around him: If they stop to hesitate for even a second, Eren and his Colossal Titans will ruin the world. It's one of those points where the adrenalin rush of combat is allowed to overtake the more sane and reasonable parts of the human brain, and you're allowed to get just a little bit excited about the insanely cool shit that these soldiers are able to accomplish in times of extreme danger. MAPPA's production has been understandably shaky recently, but they pulled out the big guns for this one. It has always been dubiously ethical to revel in all of the bloodshed while still going along with the anime's stridently anti-war perspective for all these years, and that is unlikely to change so long as we have stories about war that strive to entertain its audience while imparting some kind of moral lesson.   At the very least, “Retrospective” features some of the goriest and impressively choreographed action that The Final Season has ever delivered, and every character gets a moment to shine. Conny gets to wreak enough havoc alone that it reminds you of why he graduated in the top ranks of the trainees to begin with, and Hange joins in the fracas as well. Mikasa's showstopping set piece is so over-the-top bloody that it's almost funny, and feels tailor made to serve as a highlight for the innumerable fist-pumping hard-rock AMVs that the fandom will be pumping out for years to come. Falco has an awesome turn as the new Jaw Titan (which I have affectionately dubbed “Chicken Boo”), but our girl Gabi steals the show with yet another one-in-a-million no-scope that shoots Floch right out of the goddamned sky. I doubt the bastard is dead, but I will feel so vindicated if Gabi was the one to finally squash that bug for good.  ”Restrospective” isn't all mindless spectacle, either. Attack on Titan is classy enough to remember that all of this murder and killing isn't actually a good thing, and we get some very powerful character beats to send that message home. Shadis and Magath's last stand is the standout scene of the episode, and it makes perfect sense that these two old dogs would meet for the first time in the final moments of their life. This kind of heroic sacrifice is par for the course when it comes to war stories like AoT, but the old men's final words drive home the themes that the show has been working so hard to cultivate. The suffering and exploitation of children has been at the forefront of Attack on Titan's concerns since Episode 1, and Magath takes one last opportunity to express regret not just for his own bigotry, but for how he drove innocent children into fighting the same hateful wars on his nation's behalf.  Annie mirrors the same sentiment that Shadis and Magath do, right before they blow the hell out of the Jeagerist compound. There has been so much suffering, so much loss, so much needless destruction, and the only way to make any of it worth it would be to ensure that they find a way to stop the war for good. According to Hange, Liberio and Marley are doomed no matter what they do, and while Annie nearly gives up in her grief, she understands that fighting for the future is the only option they have left. It's what Magath and Shadis died for. In all likelihood, it's what Eren will have to die for, too.  Armin and Mikasa aren't able to respond when Annie asks if killing Eren is something that they can live with, but they will have to make their decision soon. With only one more episode (and the inevitable final film/mini-series) to go, our heroes no longer have the luxury of indecision. There's no more time left to waste. The end is here.  Rating:                 Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 Episode 86  by James Beckett, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 86 of Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ?                     Community score: 4.3              “I've been looking for a good time to die.”  “Retrospective” is one of those Attack on Titan episodes that wrestles with the same fundamental paradox that has stymied so many of the war stories that came before it: Is it possible to do justice the horror and tragedy of war if you're also indulging in the bloody spectacle of it all? It's not the first time that AoT has walked the line between grim parable and bombastic entertainment, but this might be the most glaring instance of the show fighting to have its cake and eat it too. For weeks now, we've been watching the human survivors on Paradis come to grips with their own guilt and culpability, and “Traitor” went so far as to devote a full half-hour to drawing out the terrible suspense that Armin and the others felt as it became more and more certain that they'd have to betray and kill their former friends to save the world.  At the same time, Attack on Titan is the anime where soldiers zip around on rocket-powered grappling hooks so they can dual-wield their swords and slice up giant monsters, never mind that they sometimes become those monsters in order to stir up some positively badass giant fights. Sure, at this moment, the tension is high and the line between friend and foe has become hopelessly blurry, but no matter how awful and stomach-churning things get on the battlefield, there's still that ancient, reptilian corner of our brain that isn't ashamed to hoot and holler with approval when our heroes get some real good killing done.  It's like Jean reminds himself as the carnage begins to explode all around him: If they stop to hesitate for even a second, Eren and his Colossal Titans will ruin the world. It's one of those points where the adrenalin rush of combat is allowed to overtake the more sane and reasonable parts of the human brain, and you're allowed to get just a little bit excited about the insanely cool shit that these soldiers are able to accomplish in times of extreme danger. MAPPA's production has been understandably shaky recently, but they pulled out the big guns for this one. It has always been dubiously ethical to revel in all of the bloodshed while still going along with the anime's stridently anti-war perspective for all these years, and that is unlikely to change so long as we have stories about war that strive to entertain its audience while imparting some kind of moral lesson.   At the very least, “Retrospective” features some of the goriest and impressively choreographed action that The Final Season has ever delivered, and every character gets a moment to shine. Conny gets to wreak enough havoc alone that it reminds you of why he graduated in the top ranks of the trainees to begin with, and Hange joins in the fracas as well. Mikasa's showstopping set piece is so over-the-top bloody that it's almost funny, and feels tailor made to serve as a highlight for the innumerable fist-pumping hard-rock AMVs that the fandom will be pumping out for years to come. Falco has an awesome turn as the new Jaw Titan (which I have affectionately dubbed “Chicken Boo”), but our girl Gabi steals the show with yet another one-in-a-million no-scope that shoots Floch right out of the goddamned sky. I doubt the bastard is dead, but I will feel so vindicated if Gabi was the one to finally squash that bug for good.  ”Restrospective” isn't all mindless spectacle, either. Attack on Titan is classy enough to remember that all of this murder and killing isn't actually a good thing, and we get some very powerful character beats to send that message home. Shadis and Magath's last stand is the standout scene of the episode, and it makes perfect sense that these two old dogs would meet for the first time in the final moments of their life. This kind of heroic sacrifice is par for the course when it comes to war stories like AoT, but the old men's final words drive home the themes that the show has been working so hard to cultivate. The suffering and exploitation of children has been at the forefront of Attack on Titan's concerns since Episode 1, and Magath takes one last opportunity to express regret not just for his own bigotry, but for how he drove innocent children into fighting the same hateful wars on his nation's behalf.  Annie mirrors the same sentiment that Shadis and Magath do, right before they blow the hell out of the Jeagerist compound. There has been so much suffering, so much loss, so much needless destruction, and the only way to make any of it worth it would be to ensure that they find a way to stop the war for good. According to Hange, Liberio and Marley are doomed no matter what they do, and while Annie nearly gives up in her grief, she understands that fighting for the future is the only option they have left. It's what Magath and Shadis died for. In all likelihood, it's what Eren will have to die for, too.  Armin and Mikasa aren't able to respond when Annie asks if killing Eren is something that they can live with, but they will have to make their decision soon. With only one more episode (and the inevitable final film/mini-series) to go, our heroes no longer have the luxury of indecision. There's no more time left to waste. The end is here.  Rating:                 Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

Falco has an awesome turn as the new Jaw Titan (which I have affectionately dubbed “Chicken Boo”), but our girl Gabi steals the show with yet another one-in-a-million no-scope that shoots Floch right out of the goddamned sky. I doubt the bastard is dead, but I will feel so vindicated if Gabi was the one to finally squash that bug for good.  ”Restrospective” isn't all mindless spectacle, either. Attack on Titan is classy enough to remember that all of this murder and killing isn't actually a good thing, and we get some very powerful character beats to send that message home. Shadis and Magath's last stand is the standout scene of the episode, and it makes perfect sense that these two old dogs would meet for the first time in the final moments of their life. This kind of heroic sacrifice is par for the course when it comes to war stories like AoT, but the old men's final words drive home the themes that the show has been working so hard to cultivate. The suffering and exploitation of children has been at the forefront of Attack on Titan's concerns since Episode 1, and Magath takes one last opportunity to express regret not just for his own bigotry, but for how he drove innocent children into fighting the same hateful wars on his nation's behalf.  Annie mirrors the same sentiment that Shadis and Magath do, right before they blow the hell out of the Jeagerist compound. There has been so much suffering, so much loss, so much needless destruction, and the only way to make any of it worth it would be to ensure that they find a way to stop the war for good. According to Hange, Liberio and Marley are doomed no matter what they do, and while Annie nearly gives up in her grief, she understands that fighting for the future is the only option they have left. It's what Magath and Shadis died for. In all likelihood, it's what Eren will have to die for, too.  Armin and Mikasa aren't able to respond when Annie asks if killing Eren is something that they can live with, but they will have to make their decision soon. With only one more episode (and the inevitable final film/mini-series) to go, our heroes no longer have the luxury of indecision. There's no more time left to waste. The end is here.

Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 Episode 86  by James Beckett, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 86 of Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ?                     Community score: 4.3              “I've been looking for a good time to die.”  “Retrospective” is one of those Attack on Titan episodes that wrestles with the same fundamental paradox that has stymied so many of the war stories that came before it: Is it possible to do justice the horror and tragedy of war if you're also indulging in the bloody spectacle of it all? It's not the first time that AoT has walked the line between grim parable and bombastic entertainment, but this might be the most glaring instance of the show fighting to have its cake and eat it too. For weeks now, we've been watching the human survivors on Paradis come to grips with their own guilt and culpability, and “Traitor” went so far as to devote a full half-hour to drawing out the terrible suspense that Armin and the others felt as it became more and more certain that they'd have to betray and kill their former friends to save the world.  At the same time, Attack on Titan is the anime where soldiers zip around on rocket-powered grappling hooks so they can dual-wield their swords and slice up giant monsters, never mind that they sometimes become those monsters in order to stir up some positively badass giant fights. Sure, at this moment, the tension is high and the line between friend and foe has become hopelessly blurry, but no matter how awful and stomach-churning things get on the battlefield, there's still that ancient, reptilian corner of our brain that isn't ashamed to hoot and holler with approval when our heroes get some real good killing done.  It's like Jean reminds himself as the carnage begins to explode all around him: If they stop to hesitate for even a second, Eren and his Colossal Titans will ruin the world. It's one of those points where the adrenalin rush of combat is allowed to overtake the more sane and reasonable parts of the human brain, and you're allowed to get just a little bit excited about the insanely cool shit that these soldiers are able to accomplish in times of extreme danger. MAPPA's production has been understandably shaky recently, but they pulled out the big guns for this one. It has always been dubiously ethical to revel in all of the bloodshed while still going along with the anime's stridently anti-war perspective for all these years, and that is unlikely to change so long as we have stories about war that strive to entertain its audience while imparting some kind of moral lesson.   At the very least, “Retrospective” features some of the goriest and impressively choreographed action that The Final Season has ever delivered, and every character gets a moment to shine. Conny gets to wreak enough havoc alone that it reminds you of why he graduated in the top ranks of the trainees to begin with, and Hange joins in the fracas as well. Mikasa's showstopping set piece is so over-the-top bloody that it's almost funny, and feels tailor made to serve as a highlight for the innumerable fist-pumping hard-rock AMVs that the fandom will be pumping out for years to come. Falco has an awesome turn as the new Jaw Titan (which I have affectionately dubbed “Chicken Boo”), but our girl Gabi steals the show with yet another one-in-a-million no-scope that shoots Floch right out of the goddamned sky. I doubt the bastard is dead, but I will feel so vindicated if Gabi was the one to finally squash that bug for good.  ”Restrospective” isn't all mindless spectacle, either. Attack on Titan is classy enough to remember that all of this murder and killing isn't actually a good thing, and we get some very powerful character beats to send that message home.

Mikasa's showstopping set piece is so over-the-top bloody that it's almost funny, and feels tailor made to serve as a highlight for the innumerable fist-pumping hard-rock AMVs that the fandom will be pumping out for years to come. Falco has an awesome turn as the new Jaw Titan (which I have affectionately dubbed “Chicken Boo”), but our girl Gabi steals the show with yet another one-in-a-million no-scope that shoots Floch right out of the goddamned sky. I doubt the bastard is dead, but I will feel so vindicated if Gabi was the one to finally squash that bug for good.  ”Restrospective” isn't all mindless spectacle, either. Attack on Titan is classy enough to remember that all of this murder and killing isn't actually a good thing, and we get some very powerful character beats to send that message home. Shadis and Magath's last stand is the standout scene of the episode, and it makes perfect sense that these two old dogs would meet for the first time in the final moments of their life. This kind of heroic sacrifice is par for the course when it comes to war stories like AoT, but the old men's final words drive home the themes that the show has been working so hard to cultivate. The suffering and exploitation of children has been at the forefront of Attack on Titan's concerns since Episode 1, and Magath takes one last opportunity to express regret not just for his own bigotry, but for how he drove innocent children into fighting the same hateful wars on his nation's behalf.  Annie mirrors the same sentiment that Shadis and Magath do, right before they blow the hell out of the Jeagerist compound. There has been so much suffering, so much loss, so much needless destruction, and the only way to make any of it worth it would be to ensure that they find a way to stop the war for good. According to Hange, Liberio and Marley are doomed no matter what they do, and while Annie nearly gives up in her grief, she understands that fighting for the future is the only option they have left. It's what Magath and Shadis died for. In all likelihood, it's what Eren will have to die for, too.  Armin and Mikasa aren't able to respond when Annie asks if killing Eren is something that they can live with, but they will have to make their decision soon. With only one more episode (and the inevitable final film/mini-series) to go, our heroes no longer have the luxury of indecision. There's no more time left to waste. The end is here.

Community score: 4.3              “I've been looking for a good time to die.”  “Retrospective” is one of those Attack on Titan episodes that wrestles with the same fundamental paradox that has stymied so many of the war stories that came before it: Is it possible to do justice the horror and tragedy of war if you're also indulging in the bloody spectacle of it all? It's not the first time that AoT has walked the line between grim parable and bombastic entertainment, but this might be the most glaring instance of the show fighting to have its cake and eat it too. For weeks now, we've been watching the human survivors on Paradis come to grips with their own guilt and culpability, and “Traitor” went so far as to devote a full half-hour to drawing out the terrible suspense that Armin and the others felt as it became more and more certain that they'd have to betray and kill their former friends to save the world.  At the same time, Attack on Titan is the anime where soldiers zip around on rocket-powered grappling hooks so they can dual-wield their swords and slice up giant monsters, never mind that they sometimes become those monsters in order to stir up some positively badass giant fights. Sure, at this moment, the tension is high and the line between friend and foe has become hopelessly blurry, but no matter how awful and stomach-churning things get on the battlefield, there's still that ancient, reptilian corner of our brain that isn't ashamed to hoot and holler with approval when our heroes get some real good killing done.  It's like Jean reminds himself as the carnage begins to explode all around him: If they stop to hesitate for even a second, Eren and his Colossal Titans will ruin the world. It's one of those points where the adrenalin rush of combat is allowed to overtake the more sane and reasonable parts of the human brain, and you're allowed to get just a little bit excited about the insanely cool shit that these soldiers are able to accomplish in times of extreme danger. MAPPA's production has been understandably shaky recently, but they pulled out the big guns for this one. It has always been dubiously ethical to revel in all of the bloodshed while still going along with the anime's stridently anti-war perspective for all these years, and that is unlikely to change so long as we have stories about war that strive to entertain its audience while imparting some kind of moral lesson.

According to Hange, Liberio and Marley are doomed no matter what they do, and while Annie nearly gives up in her grief, she understands that fighting for the future is the only option they have left. It's what Magath and Shadis died for. In all likelihood, it's what Eren will have to die for, too.  Armin and Mikasa aren't able to respond when Annie asks if killing Eren is something that they can live with, but they will have to make their decision soon. With only one more episode (and the inevitable final film/mini-series) to go, our heroes no longer have the luxury of indecision. There's no more time left to waste. The end is here.

News Netflix: More Than Half of Members Globally Watched 'Anime' Last Year   posted on 2022-03-30 19:15 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra           Director of anime creative at Netflix Kohei Obara revealed to entertainment magazine Variety on Monday that ""more than half"" of Netflix's worldwide audience watched ""anime"" last year. The number expands to 90% for Japanese Netflix subscribers.    Netflix classifies Japanese animated titles as well as several Western animated titles as ""anime."" Obara stated, ""anime is one of the cornerstones of [Netflix's] investment in Japan,"" adding the company plans on diversifying its selection of titles for Japan and worldwide audiences alike.

Pile of Shame FINAL: Chie the Brat The Pile of Shame recedes into the mists of history with one final installment, on Isao Takahata's criminally underseen Chie the Brat.  « »     Pile of Shame        — Archives —                  Filters          All Southeast Asia  •  Anime Manga Novels Games Music Merch Events Industry People Live-Action COVID-19           Text-only Compact View             Text-only List View             Text-only Grid View             List View with Images             Grid View with Images                               column          39 comments       Pile of Shame - Colorful   2014 Nov 12, 01:00 39 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at an understated art house drama anime from a few years ago, and finds a lot to admire. ―  COLORFUL To paraphrase Hideaki Anno, people don't commit suicide because they're depressed, people commit suicide because they can no longer imagine happiness. That thought occurred to me again and again while I was watching Colorful, the remarkable feature film produced by Sunrise in 2010,...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - SOS!

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me! Chameleon   2014 Sep 17, 00:00 31 comments                 anime    This little-seen delinquent comedy, an early ADV release, made Justin want to hurt himself. ―  Bite Me! Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F. Fujio's famous magical large blue cat character who's the star of over 2500 episodes of TV anime and 35 movies (not including short...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Guyver: Out of Control   2014 Jun 11, 03:43 18 comments                 anime    A mildly entertaining, but super-dated OAV incarnation of everyone's favorite superhero/grotesque monster/schoolboy. ―  Guyver: Out of Control Guyver: Out of Control was one of the earliest anime VHS releases in the US, and being an alternate retelling of the same story that the same company, US Renditions, would later release in dubbed form, was one of the first titles to confuse the hell out of peo...                    column          45 comments       Pile of Shame - Full Moon O Sagashite   2014 May 28, 00:00 45 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look back at the oddball Magical-Idol-Singer-With-Cancer Show from the early '00s. Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work. Others take it...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Nitaboh   2014 Apr 16, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    One of the few anime biographies, Nitaboh is surprisingly formulaic for being a true story. ―  Nitaboh, The Shamisen Master Last year, an old friend of mine asked me to help a non-profit group of radio producers come up with a Kickstarter video for a public radio project called ""Heavenly Sight,"" a multi-part audio documentary and web resource on blind African American blues and jazz musicians. It was...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo)   2014 Apr  2, 00:00 18 comments                 anime    A non-hentai show from hentai producers that somehow nobody remembers, despite getting two dubs. There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English. I lay blame for that mostly in his ...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun   2014 Mar  5, 02:24 23 comments                 anime    Isao Takahata's troubled first feature is easily the best anime of the 1960s. ―  Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun It's the iron age, somewhere in Scandinavia, and a young boy warrior named Hols is just coming back home from a fierce battle with a pack of wolves. His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we. In the front seat a...                    column          14 comments       Pile of Shame - Natsuki Crisis   2014 Feb  5, 01:00 14 comments                 anime    A fun two-part girls-fighting-in-high-school OAV that doesn't take itself too seriously... until it does. ―  Natsuki Crisis When we first meet Kitsumi Natsuki, she's in her school dojo, gleefully trying to find a sparring partner. The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody. Luckily by this time, humanity had a pretty decent settlement going on the moon, and once thin...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - After School Tinker Bell   2014 Jan  8, 01:00 23 comments                 anime    This week, an OAV based on a light novel series about a romantic couple that solves mysteries around their school. ―  After School Tinker Bell In the last few years there have been a ton of anime adapted from light novels: those small, pulpy, simply written and easy-to-read populist books that lie somewhere between young adult novels and manga. But light novels have been around for a very long time, ...                    column          12 comments       Pile of Shame - Handsome Girl   2013 Dec 25, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    Justin revisits an old one-shot OAV by the creator of Marmalade Boy... and is a little underwhelmed. ―  Handsome Girl When I was in high school, I loved the show Marmalade Boy. A lot. In fact, I wrote an article about it! A perfectly addictive confectionary of chaste teenaged yearning and romance, and undiluted raw crippling angst, I lost many an evening to the adventures of the lovelorn protagonists...                    column          11 comments       Pile of Shame - The Sensualist   2013 Dec 11, 02:10 11 comments                 anime    This week, a unique erotic historical fiction film that has completely slipped through the cracks. ―  The Sensualist (A.K.A. The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty. It felt like a piece of another person's life, so fo...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - Emblem Take 2   2013 Nov 27, 02:02 16 comments                 anime    This week, a rare yakuza time travel comedy. Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing. Unless you go looking for trouble in Tokyo, it's unlikely that a...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame: Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories   2013 Nov 13, 01:13 17 comments                 anime    Trying to watch this OAV like biting into a large wad of wet cotton: it's not offensive or unpleasant, but you want to end the experience as fast as humanly possible. ―  Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories If there's anything that anime lacks, it's real, adult love stories. We have enough yearning, angsty teen romance to sink a battleship, but realistic love stories about people whose frontal lobes are fir...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Wanna-Be's   2013 Oct 30, 00:01 23 comments     Did anyone say ""I want more women's wrestling anime?"" .... No? Didn't think so. ―  Wanna-Be's Lately there's been a lot of chatter about the girls' wrestling TV series, Wanna Be The Strongest In The World. Given that virtually none of the chatter is positive, I'm not really making plans to check out the show for myself. But hearing about a mediocre girls' wresting anime did jog my memory about anothe...                    column          5 comments       Pile of Shame - Grandeek: The Alternative   2013 Sep 18, 00:56 5 comments                 anime    An early digipaint OAV that has a lot of potential, but is so awkwardly made that the storytelling really suffers. ―  Grandeek: The Alternative When visiting Japan, one of my favorite things to do is explore the DVD sections of every Book Off location I can find. Usually I can identify and easily dismiss pretty much everything on the shelf, but every once in a while I happen upon something that I hav...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman   2013 Sep  4, 00:00 17 comments                 anime                manga    It could've been offensive, bawdy, witty and hilarious. Instead, it's just sort of lazy and crappy. ―  Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman One thing you can say about Butt Attack Girl Punisher Gautaman (and its sequel OAV, Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman R), you know pretty much exactly what you're getting: a cut-rate early-90s dirty comedy OAV about a girl that beats dudes down with her butt. It o...                    column          43 comments       Pile of Shame - Yagami-kun's Family Affairs   2013 Aug 21, 00:08 43 comments                 anime    This week, a slapstick comedy OAV from 1990 that's all about incest. ―  Yagami-kun's Family Affairs Remember when incest was shocking? I mean that honestly.

That thought occurred to me again and again while I was watching Colorful, the remarkable feature film produced by Sunrise in 2010,...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - SOS!

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F. Fujio's famous magical large blue cat character who's the star of over 2500 episodes of TV anime and 35 movies (not including short...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Guyver: Out of Control   2014 Jun 11, 03:43 18 comments                 anime    A mildly entertaining, but super-dated OAV incarnation of everyone's favorite superhero/grotesque monster/schoolboy. ―  Guyver: Out of Control Guyver: Out of Control was one of the earliest anime VHS releases in the US, and being an alternate retelling of the same story that the same company, US Renditions, would later release in dubbed form, was one of the first titles to confuse the hell out of peo...                    column          45 comments       Pile of Shame - Full Moon O Sagashite   2014 May 28, 00:00 45 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look back at the oddball Magical-Idol-Singer-With-Cancer Show from the early '00s. Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work. Others take it...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Nitaboh   2014 Apr 16, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    One of the few anime biographies, Nitaboh is surprisingly formulaic for being a true story. ―  Nitaboh, The Shamisen Master Last year, an old friend of mine asked me to help a non-profit group of radio producers come up with a Kickstarter video for a public radio project called ""Heavenly Sight,"" a multi-part audio documentary and web resource on blind African American blues and jazz musicians.

There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English. I lay blame for that mostly in his ...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun   2014 Mar  5, 02:24 23 comments                 anime    Isao Takahata's troubled first feature is easily the best anime of the 1960s. ―  Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun It's the iron age, somewhere in Scandinavia, and a young boy warrior named Hols is just coming back home from a fierce battle with a pack of wolves. His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we. In the front seat a...                    column          14 comments       Pile of Shame - Natsuki Crisis   2014 Feb  5, 01:00 14 comments                 anime    A fun two-part girls-fighting-in-high-school OAV that doesn't take itself too seriously... until it does. ―  Natsuki Crisis When we first meet Kitsumi Natsuki, she's in her school dojo, gleefully trying to find a sparring partner. The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody. Luckily by this time, humanity had a pretty decent settlement going on the moon, and once thin...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - After School Tinker Bell   2014 Jan  8, 01:00 23 comments                 anime    This week, an OAV based on a light novel series about a romantic couple that solves mysteries around their school. ―  After School Tinker Bell In the last few years there have been a ton of anime adapted from light novels: those small, pulpy, simply written and easy-to-read populist books that lie somewhere between young adult novels and manga. But light novels have been around for a very long time, ...                    column          12 comments       Pile of Shame - Handsome Girl   2013 Dec 25, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    Justin revisits an old one-shot OAV by the creator of Marmalade Boy... and is a little underwhelmed. ―  Handsome Girl When I was in high school, I loved the show Marmalade Boy. A lot. In fact, I wrote an article about it! A perfectly addictive confectionary of chaste teenaged yearning and romance, and undiluted raw crippling angst, I lost many an evening to the adventures of the lovelorn protagonists...                    column          11 comments       Pile of Shame - The Sensualist   2013 Dec 11, 02:10 11 comments                 anime    This week, a unique erotic historical fiction film that has completely slipped through the cracks. ―  The Sensualist (A.K.A. The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty. It felt like a piece of another person's life, so fo...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - Emblem Take 2   2013 Nov 27, 02:02 16 comments                 anime    This week, a rare yakuza time travel comedy. Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing. Unless you go looking for trouble in Tokyo, it's unlikely that a...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame: Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories   2013 Nov 13, 01:13 17 comments                 anime    Trying to watch this OAV like biting into a large wad of wet cotton: it's not offensive or unpleasant, but you want to end the experience as fast as humanly possible. ―  Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories If there's anything that anime lacks, it's real, adult love stories.

No? Didn't think so. ―  Wanna-Be's Lately there's been a lot of chatter about the girls' wrestling TV series, Wanna Be The Strongest In The World. Given that virtually none of the chatter is positive, I'm not really making plans to check out the show for myself. But hearing about a mediocre girls' wresting anime did jog my memory about anothe...                    column          5 comments       Pile of Shame - Grandeek: The Alternative   2013 Sep 18, 00:56 5 comments                 anime    An early digipaint OAV that has a lot of potential, but is so awkwardly made that the storytelling really suffers. ―  Grandeek: The Alternative When visiting Japan, one of my favorite things to do is explore the DVD sections of every Book Off location I can find.

Instead, it's just sort of lazy and crappy. ―  Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman One thing you can say about Butt Attack Girl Punisher Gautaman (and its sequel OAV, Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman R), you know pretty much exactly what you're getting: a cut-rate early-90s dirty comedy OAV about a girl that beats dudes down with her butt.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

That thought occurred to me again and again while I was watching Colorful, the remarkable feature film produced by Sunrise in 2010,...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - SOS!

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F. Fujio's famous magical large blue cat character who's the star of over 2500 episodes of TV anime and 35 movies (not including short...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Guyver: Out of Control   2014 Jun 11, 03:43 18 comments                 anime    A mildly entertaining, but super-dated OAV incarnation of everyone's favorite superhero/grotesque monster/schoolboy. ―  Guyver: Out of Control Guyver: Out of Control was one of the earliest anime VHS releases in the US, and being an alternate retelling of the same story that the same company, US Renditions, would later release in dubbed form, was one of the first titles to confuse the hell out of peo...                    column          45 comments       Pile of Shame - Full Moon O Sagashite   2014 May 28, 00:00 45 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look back at the oddball Magical-Idol-Singer-With-Cancer Show from the early '00s. Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work. Others take it...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Nitaboh   2014 Apr 16, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    One of the few anime biographies, Nitaboh is surprisingly formulaic for being a true story. ―  Nitaboh, The Shamisen Master Last year, an old friend of mine asked me to help a non-profit group of radio producers come up with a Kickstarter video for a public radio project called ""Heavenly Sight,"" a multi-part audio documentary and web resource on blind African American blues and jazz musicians.

There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F.

Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A.

There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English.

No? Didn't think so. ―  Wanna-Be's Lately there's been a lot of chatter about the girls' wrestling TV series, Wanna Be The Strongest In The World.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA.

That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair.

Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F.

Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work.

There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English.

His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we.

The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody.

The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me.

Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now.

As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F. Fujio's famous magical large blue cat character who's the star of over 2500 episodes of TV anime and 35 movies (not including short...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Guyver: Out of Control   2014 Jun 11, 03:43 18 comments                 anime    A mildly entertaining, but super-dated OAV incarnation of everyone's favorite superhero/grotesque monster/schoolboy. ―  Guyver: Out of Control Guyver: Out of Control was one of the earliest anime VHS releases in the US, and being an alternate retelling of the same story that the same company, US Renditions, would later release in dubbed form, was one of the first titles to confuse the hell out of peo...                    column          45 comments       Pile of Shame - Full Moon O Sagashite   2014 May 28, 00:00 45 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look back at the oddball Magical-Idol-Singer-With-Cancer Show from the early '00s. Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work. Others take it...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Nitaboh   2014 Apr 16, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    One of the few anime biographies, Nitaboh is surprisingly formulaic for being a true story. ―  Nitaboh, The Shamisen Master Last year, an old friend of mine asked me to help a non-profit group of radio producers come up with a Kickstarter video for a public radio project called ""Heavenly Sight,"" a multi-part audio documentary and web resource on blind African American blues and jazz musicians. It was...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo)   2014 Apr  2, 00:00 18 comments                 anime    A non-hentai show from hentai producers that somehow nobody remembers, despite getting two dubs. There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English. I lay blame for that mostly in his ...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun   2014 Mar  5, 02:24 23 comments                 anime    Isao Takahata's troubled first feature is easily the best anime of the 1960s. ―  Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun It's the iron age, somewhere in Scandinavia, and a young boy warrior named Hols is just coming back home from a fierce battle with a pack of wolves. His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we. In the front seat a...                    column          14 comments       Pile of Shame - Natsuki Crisis   2014 Feb  5, 01:00 14 comments                 anime    A fun two-part girls-fighting-in-high-school OAV that doesn't take itself too seriously... until it does. ―  Natsuki Crisis When we first meet Kitsumi Natsuki, she's in her school dojo, gleefully trying to find a sparring partner. The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody. Luckily by this time, humanity had a pretty decent settlement going on the moon, and once thin...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - After School Tinker Bell   2014 Jan  8, 01:00 23 comments                 anime    This week, an OAV based on a light novel series about a romantic couple that solves mysteries around their school. ―  After School Tinker Bell In the last few years there have been a ton of anime adapted from light novels: those small, pulpy, simply written and easy-to-read populist books that lie somewhere between young adult novels and manga. But light novels have been around for a very long time, ...                    column          12 comments       Pile of Shame - Handsome Girl   2013 Dec 25, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    Justin revisits an old one-shot OAV by the creator of Marmalade Boy... and is a little underwhelmed. ―  Handsome Girl When I was in high school, I loved the show Marmalade Boy. A lot. In fact, I wrote an article about it! A perfectly addictive confectionary of chaste teenaged yearning and romance, and undiluted raw crippling angst, I lost many an evening to the adventures of the lovelorn protagonists...                    column          11 comments       Pile of Shame - The Sensualist   2013 Dec 11, 02:10 11 comments                 anime    This week, a unique erotic historical fiction film that has completely slipped through the cracks. ―  The Sensualist (A.K.A. The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty. It felt like a piece of another person's life, so fo...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - Emblem Take 2   2013 Nov 27, 02:02 16 comments                 anime    This week, a rare yakuza time travel comedy. Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing. Unless you go looking for trouble in Tokyo, it's unlikely that a...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame: Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories   2013 Nov 13, 01:13 17 comments                 anime    Trying to watch this OAV like biting into a large wad of wet cotton: it's not offensive or unpleasant, but you want to end the experience as fast as humanly possible. ―  Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories If there's anything that anime lacks, it's real, adult love stories. We have enough yearning, angsty teen romance to sink a battleship, but realistic love stories about people whose frontal lobes are fir...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Wanna-Be's   2013 Oct 30, 00:01 23 comments     Did anyone say ""I want more women's wrestling anime?"" .... No? Didn't think so. ―  Wanna-Be's Lately there's been a lot of chatter about the girls' wrestling TV series, Wanna Be The Strongest In The World. Given that virtually none of the chatter is positive, I'm not really making plans to check out the show for myself. But hearing about a mediocre girls' wresting anime did jog my memory about anothe...                    column          5 comments       Pile of Shame - Grandeek: The Alternative   2013 Sep 18, 00:56 5 comments                 anime    An early digipaint OAV that has a lot of potential, but is so awkwardly made that the storytelling really suffers. ―  Grandeek: The Alternative When visiting Japan, one of my favorite things to do is explore the DVD sections of every Book Off location I can find. Usually I can identify and easily dismiss pretty much everything on the shelf, but every once in a while I happen upon something that I hav...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman   2013 Sep  4, 00:00 17 comments                 anime                manga    It could've been offensive, bawdy, witty and hilarious. Instead, it's just sort of lazy and crappy. ―  Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman One thing you can say about Butt Attack Girl Punisher Gautaman (and its sequel OAV, Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman R), you know pretty much exactly what you're getting: a cut-rate early-90s dirty comedy OAV about a girl that beats dudes down with her butt.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god."" You can tell what we used to be like by going up to your...                    column          28 comments       Pile of Shame - Moshidora   2013 Aug  7, 02:32 28 comments                 anime    Only Japan would attempt to take a business management textbook and turn it into a high school sports story. ―  Moshidora When I first heard the premise behind Moshidora, which is short for a ridiculously long title that translates to, ""What If the Girl Manager of a High School Baseball Team Read Drucker's 'Management?'"" I believe I laughed and said, ""Oh, Japan."" Because really, what other response i...                    column          22 comments       Pile of Shame - Kenya Boy   2013 Jul 24, 01:00 22 comments                 anime    Adjectives fail Justin has he tries to describe the absolute insanity contained in a 1984 feature film retelling of a popular 1950s manga series. ― One of the benefits to writing a column on obscure anime for so long is that occasionally friends hand you things that they think would inspire a good column.

News KanColle Anime Season 2 Streams Teaser   posted on 2022-04-01 12:08 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         8-episode KanColle: Itsuka Ano Umi de season premieres in November    Kadokawa posted the teaser trailer for KanColle: Itsuka Ano Umi de (Kan Colle: Someday in that Sea), the second season of the Kan Colle anime, on Friday. The teaser's footage first debuted during the anime's AnimeJapan 2022 panel last Saturday and earlier events.          Kadokawa revealed that anime will only have eight episodes (as opposed to the usual one cours television anime length of 11-13 episodes), as the production specifically wanted to heighten the quality by telling a more compact story with fewer episodes.    The anime's cast includes Saki Fujita, Yumi Tanabe, Aya Suzaki, Yui Horie, Iori Nomizu, Yui Ogura, Risa Taneda, Kozue Hayasaka, Wakana Miyawaka, Mana Komatsu, Ayana Taketatsu, Yuki Yamada, and Nao Tōyama.    Kazuya Miura (DRAMAtical Murder, Full Dive, Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!) is directing the anime at ENGI. Kensuke Tanaka, the original writer for the franchise, is penning the scripts for the anime. Chika Nōmi is designing the characters. Kaori Ohkoshi is composing the music, while Yuichi Imaizumi is the sound director.    Publisher Kadokawa reported in its financial results report in November 2019 that the ""second season"" of the Kan Colle television anime was still in production. Kadokawa told C2 Kikan in January 2021 that the second season would air in 2022.    The anime is based on a web browser game that launched in 2013, and is set in a world where humanity has lost control of the seas. The threat that has taken over the seas is the Abyssal fleet. The only ones who can counter this threat are Kan-Musu (Fleet Girls), girls who possess the spirit of naval vessels from days gone by.    The first 12-episode TV anime series premiered in January 2015 and Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan. Funimation released the series on DVD and Blu-ray Disc with English subtitles and an English dub in June 2017.    The final episode of the first television anime series had revealed in March 2015 that the television anime would get a sequel. The anime's official Twitter account indicated in August 2015 that the franchise's movie project and the sequel were separate projects that went into production at the same time.    The Kantai Collection -KanColle- film opened in Japan in November 2016, and  earned 560 million yen (about US$5 million) by March 2017.    Studio ENGI — the 2D/3D animation studio that publisher Kadokawa, pachinko and pachislot game machine maker Sammy, and anime holding company Ultra Super Pictures established in April 2018 — is producing the new anime.

News KanColle Anime Season 2 Streams Teaser   posted on 2022-04-01 12:08 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         8-episode KanColle: Itsuka Ano Umi de season premieres in November    Kadokawa posted the teaser trailer for KanColle: Itsuka Ano Umi de (Kan Colle: Someday in that Sea), the second season of the Kan Colle anime, on Friday. The teaser's footage first debuted during the anime's AnimeJapan 2022 panel last Saturday and earlier events.          Kadokawa revealed that anime will only have eight episodes (as opposed to the usual one cours television anime length of 11-13 episodes), as the production specifically wanted to heighten the quality by telling a more compact story with fewer episodes.    The anime's cast includes Saki Fujita, Yumi Tanabe, Aya Suzaki, Yui Horie, Iori Nomizu, Yui Ogura, Risa Taneda, Kozue Hayasaka, Wakana Miyawaka, Mana Komatsu, Ayana Taketatsu, Yuki Yamada, and Nao Tōyama.    Kazuya Miura (DRAMAtical Murder, Full Dive, Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!) is directing the anime at ENGI. Kensuke Tanaka, the original writer for the franchise, is penning the scripts for the anime. Chika Nōmi is designing the characters. Kaori Ohkoshi is composing the music, while Yuichi Imaizumi is the sound director.    Publisher Kadokawa reported in its financial results report in November 2019 that the ""second season"" of the Kan Colle television anime was still in production. Kadokawa told C2 Kikan in January 2021 that the second season would air in 2022.    The anime is based on a web browser game that launched in 2013, and is set in a world where humanity has lost control of the seas. The threat that has taken over the seas is the Abyssal fleet. The only ones who can counter this threat are Kan-Musu (Fleet Girls), girls who possess the spirit of naval vessels from days gone by.    The first 12-episode TV anime series premiered in January 2015 and Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan. Funimation released the series on DVD and Blu-ray Disc with English subtitles and an English dub in June 2017.    The final episode of the first television anime series had revealed in March 2015 that the television anime would get a sequel. The anime's official Twitter account indicated in August 2015 that the franchise's movie project and the sequel were separate projects that went into production at the same time.    The Kantai Collection -KanColle- film opened in Japan in November 2016, and  earned 560 million yen (about US$5 million) by March 2017.    Studio ENGI — the 2D/3D animation studio that publisher Kadokawa, pachinko and pachislot game machine maker Sammy, and anime holding company Ultra Super Pictures established in April 2018 — is producing the new anime.

News KanColle Anime Season 2 Streams Teaser   posted on 2022-04-01 12:08 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         8-episode KanColle: Itsuka Ano Umi de season premieres in November    Kadokawa posted the teaser trailer for KanColle: Itsuka Ano Umi de (Kan Colle: Someday in that Sea), the second season of the Kan Colle anime, on Friday. The teaser's footage first debuted during the anime's AnimeJapan 2022 panel last Saturday and earlier events.          Kadokawa revealed that anime will only have eight episodes (as opposed to the usual one cours television anime length of 11-13 episodes), as the production specifically wanted to heighten the quality by telling a more compact story with fewer episodes.    The anime's cast includes Saki Fujita, Yumi Tanabe, Aya Suzaki, Yui Horie, Iori Nomizu, Yui Ogura, Risa Taneda, Kozue Hayasaka, Wakana Miyawaka, Mana Komatsu, Ayana Taketatsu, Yuki Yamada, and Nao Tōyama.    Kazuya Miura (DRAMAtical Murder, Full Dive, Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!) is directing the anime at ENGI. Kensuke Tanaka, the original writer for the franchise, is penning the scripts for the anime. Chika Nōmi is designing the characters. Kaori Ohkoshi is composing the music, while Yuichi Imaizumi is the sound director.    Publisher Kadokawa reported in its financial results report in November 2019 that the ""second season"" of the Kan Colle television anime was still in production. Kadokawa told C2 Kikan in January 2021 that the second season would air in 2022.    The anime is based on a web browser game that launched in 2013, and is set in a world where humanity has lost control of the seas. The threat that has taken over the seas is the Abyssal fleet. The only ones who can counter this threat are Kan-Musu (Fleet Girls), girls who possess the spirit of naval vessels from days gone by.    The first 12-episode TV anime series premiered in January 2015 and Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan. Funimation released the series on DVD and Blu-ray Disc with English subtitles and an English dub in June 2017.    The final episode of the first television anime series had revealed in March 2015 that the television anime would get a sequel. The anime's official Twitter account indicated in August 2015 that the franchise's movie project and the sequel were separate projects that went into production at the same time.    The Kantai Collection -KanColle- film opened in Japan in November 2016, and  earned 560 million yen (about US$5 million) by March 2017.    Studio ENGI — the 2D/3D animation studio that publisher Kadokawa, pachinko and pachislot game machine maker Sammy, and anime holding company Ultra Super Pictures established in April 2018 — is producing the new anime.

News KanColle Anime Season 2 Streams Teaser   posted on 2022-04-01 12:08 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         8-episode KanColle: Itsuka Ano Umi de season premieres in November    Kadokawa posted the teaser trailer for KanColle: Itsuka Ano Umi de (Kan Colle: Someday in that Sea), the second season of the Kan Colle anime, on Friday. The teaser's footage first debuted during the anime's AnimeJapan 2022 panel last Saturday and earlier events.          Kadokawa revealed that anime will only have eight episodes (as opposed to the usual one cours television anime length of 11-13 episodes), as the production specifically wanted to heighten the quality by telling a more compact story with fewer episodes.    The anime's cast includes Saki Fujita, Yumi Tanabe, Aya Suzaki, Yui Horie, Iori Nomizu, Yui Ogura, Risa Taneda, Kozue Hayasaka, Wakana Miyawaka, Mana Komatsu, Ayana Taketatsu, Yuki Yamada, and Nao Tōyama.    Kazuya Miura (DRAMAtical Murder, Full Dive, Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!) is directing the anime at ENGI. Kensuke Tanaka, the original writer for the franchise, is penning the scripts for the anime. Chika Nōmi is designing the characters. Kaori Ohkoshi is composing the music, while Yuichi Imaizumi is the sound director.    Publisher Kadokawa reported in its financial results report in November 2019 that the ""second season"" of the Kan Colle television anime was still in production. Kadokawa told C2 Kikan in January 2021 that the second season would air in 2022.    The anime is based on a web browser game that launched in 2013, and is set in a world where humanity has lost control of the seas. The threat that has taken over the seas is the Abyssal fleet. The only ones who can counter this threat are Kan-Musu (Fleet Girls), girls who possess the spirit of naval vessels from days gone by.    The first 12-episode TV anime series premiered in January 2015 and Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan. Funimation released the series on DVD and Blu-ray Disc with English subtitles and an English dub in June 2017.    The final episode of the first television anime series had revealed in March 2015 that the television anime would get a sequel. The anime's official Twitter account indicated in August 2015 that the franchise's movie project and the sequel were separate projects that went into production at the same time.    The Kantai Collection -KanColle- film opened in Japan in November 2016, and  earned 560 million yen (about US$5 million) by March 2017.    Studio ENGI — the 2D/3D animation studio that publisher Kadokawa, pachinko and pachislot game machine maker Sammy, and anime holding company Ultra Super Pictures established in April 2018 — is producing the new anime.

Kadokawa revealed that anime will only have eight episodes (as opposed to the usual one cours television anime length of 11-13 episodes), as the production specifically wanted to heighten the quality by telling a more compact story with fewer episodes.
