Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department Episode 11  by Christopher Farris, Mar 29th 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ?                     Community score: 3.9            The past couple of weeks have been strong for Miss Kuroitsu, so I suppose I was too optimistic to hope it could keep that energy up. So here we are that, one week from the finale, the show turns in what's probably its most mediocre effort to date. I think the series will still be fine overall; there's nothing here that overtly damns the series enough to nullify the fun I have had with it (among the other ups and downs) over its run. It's simply an incredibly flat entry which, like some of the series' other lesser episodes, feels like it could have been a winner had they simply tried a little harder.    Because as usual for Miss Kuroitsu, the potential with the concept is here. This is another one where the focus is more on the business-culture side of things than the tokusatsu-riffing, which is fine, since mixing things up beyond genre fanservice is good (though this episode does also throw in some cameos from Astro Fighter Sunred, in a crossover reference I can't believe it took them eleven weeks to make). And as usual with this show's askance commentary on work practices, I can empathize with the goofy setup: Kuroitsu coming along on a retreat that otherwise exclusively includes the high-ranking executives of Agastia, and bringing poor Wolf along as well. There's nothing quite so potentially stressful as trying to take a vacation only to have all your bosses intimidatingly hanging around the entire time, even moreso when they're all literal monsters with superpowers spec'd for squaring off with spandex-clad soldiers.    So it comes off like something of a wasted opportunity that Miss Kuroitsu can't seem to mine much particular comedy from such a situation. This should've been a perfect chance to see more outsized personality antics from several of these executives, many of whom we're meeting for the first time in this episode. But we hardly see them cutting loose, and what we get instead are stretches of the characters in relatively low-key hangout situations. Maybe that itself is supposed to be the 'joke': seeing these elemental embodiments and hulking animal-people just kind of chilling out in hotel robes. But the series has already worked the sight of tokusatsu monsters just vibing into its overall framework, so there isn't any fresh humor or entertainment value derived from seeing these weirdos sit around and play video games.    It doesn't help that when the episode is going for more specific comedy setups, it's from more uncomfortable angles. Yes, the real reason poor Wolf has been brought along on this trip is so he can get harassed again. This time around the perpetrator is Skylla, seemingly the predatory lesbian of the Agastia corporate ladder (who, if we're to believe a passing comment, apparently hooked up with Arachne at some earlier point?). She, ha ha, mistakes Wolf's gender and targets him for her affections, and also, ha ha, he can't turn her down due to a combination of her power within the organization and his own subservient pack instincts. So it goes that we go through several scenes of agonizingly watching Wolf be uncomfortable while Skylla harasses him in the bath and the like.    Another problem with all this is simply how rough this episode looks. Miss Kuroitsu has never exactly been a looker, but getting later in the production has done this particular entry no favors. You definitely don't want your hot springs fanservice segments to look this bottom-barrel, but with that we're left with only the poorly-articulated gag of Wolf's discomfort to carry those segments. It extends to so many of the other scenes as well, affecting even those stretches of characters just sitting around talking. They're slideshows of hardly any animation; the animalistic characters don't even move their mouths when they talk, while the faces of the more humanoid organization members slowly disintegrate with each switch of the camera. An episode that wasn't entertaining to watch might survive if it was at least decent to look at, but failing on both counts pretty well dooms the prospects of this one.    It's not a complete failure. Amongst all the low-key Executive hangouts, there are a few decent gags, mostly courtesy of Freezing Combat Executive Fleurety, who gets in fun bits like the revelation that he mostly just uses his powers for food storage. And there's a bit of a boost in entertainment about halfway through, courtesy of the appearance of the Assassin Rangers Jyuyushi. These guys appear to be a fully-fiction Sentai send-up, apart from any of the real-world Local Heroes that Miss Kuroitsu has featured, seemingly so they can be dunked on as much as the narrative wants. It results in some great digs at what pieces of work these guys are, like how impractical 'assassination' is as an aesthetic for colorful kid-friendly superheroes, or how ineffectual they are at that anyway. They even deliver one of the best gags of the episode, with the revelation of their piloting a second-hand purchased mecha that doesn't even match their aesthetic as a result. That's a great bit for a show like this! But it's also unfortunately as clever as this episode gets, with the rest of it mostly coming off as an unattractive drag too close to the finish line.

Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department Episode 11  by Christopher Farris, Mar 29th 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ?                     Community score: 3.9            The past couple of weeks have been strong for Miss Kuroitsu, so I suppose I was too optimistic to hope it could keep that energy up. So here we are that, one week from the finale, the show turns in what's probably its most mediocre effort to date. I think the series will still be fine overall; there's nothing here that overtly damns the series enough to nullify the fun I have had with it (among the other ups and downs) over its run. It's simply an incredibly flat entry which, like some of the series' other lesser episodes, feels like it could have been a winner had they simply tried a little harder.    Because as usual for Miss Kuroitsu, the potential with the concept is here. This is another one where the focus is more on the business-culture side of things than the tokusatsu-riffing, which is fine, since mixing things up beyond genre fanservice is good (though this episode does also throw in some cameos from Astro Fighter Sunred, in a crossover reference I can't believe it took them eleven weeks to make). And as usual with this show's askance commentary on work practices, I can empathize with the goofy setup: Kuroitsu coming along on a retreat that otherwise exclusively includes the high-ranking executives of Agastia, and bringing poor Wolf along as well. There's nothing quite so potentially stressful as trying to take a vacation only to have all your bosses intimidatingly hanging around the entire time, even moreso when they're all literal monsters with superpowers spec'd for squaring off with spandex-clad soldiers.    So it comes off like something of a wasted opportunity that Miss Kuroitsu can't seem to mine much particular comedy from such a situation. This should've been a perfect chance to see more outsized personality antics from several of these executives, many of whom we're meeting for the first time in this episode. But we hardly see them cutting loose, and what we get instead are stretches of the characters in relatively low-key hangout situations. Maybe that itself is supposed to be the 'joke': seeing these elemental embodiments and hulking animal-people just kind of chilling out in hotel robes. But the series has already worked the sight of tokusatsu monsters just vibing into its overall framework, so there isn't any fresh humor or entertainment value derived from seeing these weirdos sit around and play video games.    It doesn't help that when the episode is going for more specific comedy setups, it's from more uncomfortable angles. Yes, the real reason poor Wolf has been brought along on this trip is so he can get harassed again. This time around the perpetrator is Skylla, seemingly the predatory lesbian of the Agastia corporate ladder (who, if we're to believe a passing comment, apparently hooked up with Arachne at some earlier point?). She, ha ha, mistakes Wolf's gender and targets him for her affections, and also, ha ha, he can't turn her down due to a combination of her power within the organization and his own subservient pack instincts. So it goes that we go through several scenes of agonizingly watching Wolf be uncomfortable while Skylla harasses him in the bath and the like.    Another problem with all this is simply how rough this episode looks. Miss Kuroitsu has never exactly been a looker, but getting later in the production has done this particular entry no favors. You definitely don't want your hot springs fanservice segments to look this bottom-barrel, but with that we're left with only the poorly-articulated gag of Wolf's discomfort to carry those segments. It extends to so many of the other scenes as well, affecting even those stretches of characters just sitting around talking. They're slideshows of hardly any animation; the animalistic characters don't even move their mouths when they talk, while the faces of the more humanoid organization members slowly disintegrate with each switch of the camera. An episode that wasn't entertaining to watch might survive if it was at least decent to look at, but failing on both counts pretty well dooms the prospects of this one.    It's not a complete failure. Amongst all the low-key Executive hangouts, there are a few decent gags, mostly courtesy of Freezing Combat Executive Fleurety, who gets in fun bits like the revelation that he mostly just uses his powers for food storage. And there's a bit of a boost in entertainment about halfway through, courtesy of the appearance of the Assassin Rangers Jyuyushi. These guys appear to be a fully-fiction Sentai send-up, apart from any of the real-world Local Heroes that Miss Kuroitsu has featured, seemingly so they can be dunked on as much as the narrative wants. It results in some great digs at what pieces of work these guys are, like how impractical 'assassination' is as an aesthetic for colorful kid-friendly superheroes, or how ineffectual they are at that anyway. They even deliver one of the best gags of the episode, with the revelation of their piloting a second-hand purchased mecha that doesn't even match their aesthetic as a result. That's a great bit for a show like this! But it's also unfortunately as clever as this episode gets, with the rest of it mostly coming off as an unattractive drag too close to the finish line.

Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department Episode 11  by Christopher Farris, Mar 29th 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ?                     Community score: 3.9            The past couple of weeks have been strong for Miss Kuroitsu, so I suppose I was too optimistic to hope it could keep that energy up. So here we are that, one week from the finale, the show turns in what's probably its most mediocre effort to date. I think the series will still be fine overall; there's nothing here that overtly damns the series enough to nullify the fun I have had with it (among the other ups and downs) over its run. It's simply an incredibly flat entry which, like some of the series' other lesser episodes, feels like it could have been a winner had they simply tried a little harder.    Because as usual for Miss Kuroitsu, the potential with the concept is here. This is another one where the focus is more on the business-culture side of things than the tokusatsu-riffing, which is fine, since mixing things up beyond genre fanservice is good (though this episode does also throw in some cameos from Astro Fighter Sunred, in a crossover reference I can't believe it took them eleven weeks to make). And as usual with this show's askance commentary on work practices, I can empathize with the goofy setup: Kuroitsu coming along on a retreat that otherwise exclusively includes the high-ranking executives of Agastia, and bringing poor Wolf along as well. There's nothing quite so potentially stressful as trying to take a vacation only to have all your bosses intimidatingly hanging around the entire time, even moreso when they're all literal monsters with superpowers spec'd for squaring off with spandex-clad soldiers.    So it comes off like something of a wasted opportunity that Miss Kuroitsu can't seem to mine much particular comedy from such a situation. This should've been a perfect chance to see more outsized personality antics from several of these executives, many of whom we're meeting for the first time in this episode. But we hardly see them cutting loose, and what we get instead are stretches of the characters in relatively low-key hangout situations. Maybe that itself is supposed to be the 'joke': seeing these elemental embodiments and hulking animal-people just kind of chilling out in hotel robes. But the series has already worked the sight of tokusatsu monsters just vibing into its overall framework, so there isn't any fresh humor or entertainment value derived from seeing these weirdos sit around and play video games.    It doesn't help that when the episode is going for more specific comedy setups, it's from more uncomfortable angles. Yes, the real reason poor Wolf has been brought along on this trip is so he can get harassed again. This time around the perpetrator is Skylla, seemingly the predatory lesbian of the Agastia corporate ladder (who, if we're to believe a passing comment, apparently hooked up with Arachne at some earlier point?). She, ha ha, mistakes Wolf's gender and targets him for her affections, and also, ha ha, he can't turn her down due to a combination of her power within the organization and his own subservient pack instincts. So it goes that we go through several scenes of agonizingly watching Wolf be uncomfortable while Skylla harasses him in the bath and the like.    Another problem with all this is simply how rough this episode looks. Miss Kuroitsu has never exactly been a looker, but getting later in the production has done this particular entry no favors. You definitely don't want your hot springs fanservice segments to look this bottom-barrel, but with that we're left with only the poorly-articulated gag of Wolf's discomfort to carry those segments. It extends to so many of the other scenes as well, affecting even those stretches of characters just sitting around talking. They're slideshows of hardly any animation; the animalistic characters don't even move their mouths when they talk, while the faces of the more humanoid organization members slowly disintegrate with each switch of the camera. An episode that wasn't entertaining to watch might survive if it was at least decent to look at, but failing on both counts pretty well dooms the prospects of this one.    It's not a complete failure. Amongst all the low-key Executive hangouts, there are a few decent gags, mostly courtesy of Freezing Combat Executive Fleurety, who gets in fun bits like the revelation that he mostly just uses his powers for food storage. And there's a bit of a boost in entertainment about halfway through, courtesy of the appearance of the Assassin Rangers Jyuyushi. These guys appear to be a fully-fiction Sentai send-up, apart from any of the real-world Local Heroes that Miss Kuroitsu has featured, seemingly so they can be dunked on as much as the narrative wants. It results in some great digs at what pieces of work these guys are, like how impractical 'assassination' is as an aesthetic for colorful kid-friendly superheroes, or how ineffectual they are at that anyway. They even deliver one of the best gags of the episode, with the revelation of their piloting a second-hand purchased mecha that doesn't even match their aesthetic as a result. That's a great bit for a show like this! But it's also unfortunately as clever as this episode gets, with the rest of it mostly coming off as an unattractive drag too close to the finish line.

It extends to so many of the other scenes as well, affecting even those stretches of characters just sitting around talking. They're slideshows of hardly any animation; the animalistic characters don't even move their mouths when they talk, while the faces of the more humanoid organization members slowly disintegrate with each switch of the camera. An episode that wasn't entertaining to watch might survive if it was at least decent to look at, but failing on both counts pretty well dooms the prospects of this one.    It's not a complete failure. Amongst all the low-key Executive hangouts, there are a few decent gags, mostly courtesy of Freezing Combat Executive Fleurety, who gets in fun bits like the revelation that he mostly just uses his powers for food storage. And there's a bit of a boost in entertainment about halfway through, courtesy of the appearance of the Assassin Rangers Jyuyushi. These guys appear to be a fully-fiction Sentai send-up, apart from any of the real-world Local Heroes that Miss Kuroitsu has featured, seemingly so they can be dunked on as much as the narrative wants. It results in some great digs at what pieces of work these guys are, like how impractical 'assassination' is as an aesthetic for colorful kid-friendly superheroes, or how ineffectual they are at that anyway. They even deliver one of the best gags of the episode, with the revelation of their piloting a second-hand purchased mecha that doesn't even match their aesthetic as a result. That's a great bit for a show like this! But it's also unfortunately as clever as this episode gets, with the rest of it mostly coming off as an unattractive drag too close to the finish line.

The new anime will premiere on TV Tokyo in July.    Takeshi Konomi serialized The Prince of Tennis manga's original run in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine from 1999 to 2008. The manga follows middle school tennis player Ryōma Echizen as he battles rivals to reach the national tournament. That original manga inspired a 2001-2005 television anime, two anime feature films and a theatrical short, various video anime projects, a live-action film, a live-action television series in China, and a popular stage musical series.    Konomi then launched The Prince of Tennis II manga series in Shueisha's Jump SQ. magazine in 2009. The story picks up after the national tournament, when Ryōma joins a select group of middle school players at Japan's top training camp for players under 17. This ongoing sequel manga spawned its own 2012 television anime series The Prince of Tennis II. The Prince of Tennis II OVA vs. Genius 10 series then ran for five volumes from October 2014 to June 2015.    The manga also inspired the Tennis no Ōjisama BEST GAMES!! original video anime (OVA) project that retells the story of the franchise's top matches. The project includes three OVAs that released in 2018-2019. The anime franchise also includes the two-part The Prince of Tennis II Hyotei vs Rikkai Game of Future anime project that debuted on February 13 and April 17.    Most recently, the Ryōma! Shinsei Gekijōban Tennis no Ōji-sama (Ryōma! Rebirth Movie The Prince of Tennis) 3DCG film for The Prince of Tennis franchise opened on September 3.      Update: Anime's website link fixed.

The anime's Twitter account acknowledges that the surprising news sounds like an April Fool's joke, but insists that it is real.         The seven Hellenic Republic team members Seki is voicing are:    Zeus Iliopoulos (as previously announced)   Thalatta Hercules    Papadopoulos Evangelos    Vulcan Laërtius    Hermes Kounellis    Orion Stephanopoulos    Aporon (Apollon) Stephanopoulos      The anime will be the first anime in the franchise in about a decade.

J. Dorgias   Kazuyuki Okitsu as Alexander Amadeus   Natsuki Hanae as Prince Ludovic Chardard    Keiichiro Kawaguchi (ISLAND) is returning from the last 2D anime, The Prince of Tennis II Hyotei vs Rikkai Game of Future, to direct the new series at Studio KAI and M.S.C, and Mitsutaka Hirota (Anime-Gataris, Nanbaka) is again superivising the scripts.

Singer Yoshiki Ezaki and hip-hop duo Bleecker Chrome are collaborating for the anime's opening theme song ""I can fly."" TeniPri Artistars will perform the ending theme song ""Dear Friends.""    The new anime will premiere on TV Tokyo in July.    Takeshi Konomi serialized The Prince of Tennis manga's original run in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine from 1999 to 2008. The manga follows middle school tennis player Ryōma Echizen as he battles rivals to reach the national tournament. That original manga inspired a 2001-2005 television anime, two anime feature films and a theatrical short, various video anime projects, a live-action film, a live-action television series in China, and a popular stage musical series.    Konomi then launched The Prince of Tennis II manga series in Shueisha's Jump SQ. magazine in 2009. The story picks up after the national tournament, when Ryōma joins a select group of middle school players at Japan's top training camp for players under 17. This ongoing sequel manga spawned its own 2012 television anime series The Prince of Tennis II. The Prince of Tennis II OVA vs. Genius 10 series then ran for five volumes from October 2014 to June 2015.    The manga also inspired the Tennis no Ōjisama BEST GAMES!! original video anime (OVA) project that retells the story of the franchise's top matches. The project includes three OVAs that released in 2018-2019. The anime franchise also includes the two-part The Prince of Tennis II Hyotei vs Rikkai Game of Future anime project that debuted on February 13 and April 17.    Most recently, the Ryōma! Shinsei Gekijōban Tennis no Ōji-sama (Ryōma! Rebirth Movie The Prince of Tennis) 3DCG film for The Prince of Tennis franchise opened on September 3.      Update: Anime's website link fixed.

Once again, we have yet another new character and once again, no acknowledgement of any of the lingering hooks from the prior game, but in a very strange, nonsensical way they finally made my boy Viper playable (as a special attack, but still). Are we finally going to get some kind of justice for the Sumeragi crew? Dammit Inti, I'm intrigued again...

Back to top                   OdnetninAges    Joined: 03 May 2021 		    Posts: 19       Posted: Thu Mar 31, 2022 9:10 pm            I am very excited for this. Gunvolt 2 was my favorite game of 2016, and this is looking like it's going to be just as much of a blast. (I also quite liked Luminous Avenger iX.)   However, they confirmed in the stream that Limited Run Games was handling the physical version for North America. I am not a fan of this. I would prefer that Nighthawk Interactive did it, as they published the Switch and PS4 versions of the Striker Pack, and they would get it out in a more timely fashion than LRG. I am still waiting on my copy of Luminous Avenger iX 2 from LRG (not to mention Blaster Master Zero 3). I already have almost all the Gunvolt games physically and I'd really like to continue that collection, but I think I'll probably go digital for this, as I have been waiting a long time for this game and I don't want to wait any more than I have to because of LRG's shenanigans.   Of course, if this was multiplatform like the iX games, the Bloodstained: CotM games, and BMZ3 were, I could just play on another platform while waiting for a LRG copy. But for some bizarre reason, this game is a Switch exclusive.

Once again, we have yet another new character and once again, no acknowledgement of any of the lingering hooks from the prior game, but in a very strange, nonsensical way they finally made my boy Viper playable (as a special attack, but still). Are we finally going to get some kind of justice for the Sumeragi crew? Dammit Inti, I'm intrigued again...

Gunvolt 2 was my favorite game of 2016, and this is looking like it's going to be just as much of a blast. (I also quite liked Luminous Avenger iX.)   However, they confirmed in the stream that Limited Run Games was handling the physical version for North America. I am not a fan of this. I would prefer that Nighthawk Interactive did it, as they published the Switch and PS4 versions of the Striker Pack, and they would get it out in a more timely fashion than LRG. I am still waiting on my copy of Luminous Avenger iX 2 from LRG (not to mention Blaster Master Zero 3). I already have almost all the Gunvolt games physically and I'd really like to continue that collection, but I think I'll probably go digital for this, as I have been waiting a long time for this game and I don't want to wait any more than I have to because of LRG's shenanigans.   Of course, if this was multiplatform like the iX games, the Bloodstained: CotM games, and BMZ3 were, I could just play on another platform while waiting for a LRG copy. But for some bizarre reason, this game is a Switch exclusive.

I already have almost all the Gunvolt games physically and I'd really like to continue that collection, but I think I'll probably go digital for this, as I have been waiting a long time for this game and I don't want to wait any more than I have to because of LRG's shenanigans.   Of course, if this was multiplatform like the iX games, the Bloodstained: CotM games, and BMZ3 were, I could just play on another platform while waiting for a LRG copy.

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.

Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them.

The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.

Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them.

Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words.

Phantom Breaker: Omnia Spicy Edition Confirmed…to be Extra Hot   Apr  2nd 2022         The fast-paced 2D anime fighting game by Rocket Panda Games and MAGES reaches 300,000 SHU on the Scoville Scale  El Habanero, Calif. - April 1, 2022 - Publisher Rocket Panda Games and developer MAGES have unveiled the latest update to Phantom Breaker: Omnia, and it's dangerously saucy.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrOnmrpc5lk  In collaboration with THE ANNOUNCER, Rocket Panda Games is pleased to present the Spicy Edition! This update will come with two scorching new levels of commentary and will be available on all platforms this summer for the listed price of AB-SO-LUTE-LY NOTHING. No, we didn't forget to cut and paste that info in. It's so free that THE ANNOUNCER screamed “Medic!!!” just on principle. “You said you wanted more, and we listened!” said Gail Salamanca, Co-founder of Rocket Panda Games. “It's been 109 days since the trailer released, and we're so happy that Phantom Breaker: Omnia fans will be able to experience even more 'Yah! Yah! Yah! Boom Bah Yah!'”  Story A mysterious man named Phantom works from the shadows to lure powerful fighters into perpetual battle against one another. He bestows upon them mystical weapons known as “Fu-mension Artifacts” and promises the ultimate prize to the winner: a wish. Unbeknownst to these chosen hopefuls, however, their clashes shake the fabric of space-time itself, weakening the barriers between parallel universes and bringing Phantom one step closer to his own dearest desire—the return of his destructive powers and the end of the world.  Key Features      *THE ANNOUNCER     *He's back, and his voice is just as buttery smooth as before.     *Choose From 2 Levels: Spicy and EXTRA SPICY!     *In addition to the original announcer, there are now two special commentary tracks available—original commentary by THE ANNOUNCER and fiery hot commentary by THE ANNOUNCER.     *Twenty-five Thousand 100% More Spoken Words!     *This is a lie, but it sounds great, so we're leaving it in.     *It's Free!     THIS INCREDIBLE UPDATE TO PHANTOM BREAKER: OMNIA WILL BE AVAILABLE ON ALL PLATFORMS AND IS SO FREE THAT WE'RE CAPPING EVERYTHING.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Press Release homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Phantom Breaker: Omnia Spicy Edition Confirmed…to be Extra Hot   Apr  2nd 2022         The fast-paced 2D anime fighting game by Rocket Panda Games and MAGES reaches 300,000 SHU on the Scoville Scale  El Habanero, Calif. - April 1, 2022 - Publisher Rocket Panda Games and developer MAGES have unveiled the latest update to Phantom Breaker: Omnia, and it's dangerously saucy.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrOnmrpc5lk  In collaboration with THE ANNOUNCER, Rocket Panda Games is pleased to present the Spicy Edition! This update will come with two scorching new levels of commentary and will be available on all platforms this summer for the listed price of AB-SO-LUTE-LY NOTHING. No, we didn't forget to cut and paste that info in. It's so free that THE ANNOUNCER screamed “Medic!!!” just on principle. “You said you wanted more, and we listened!” said Gail Salamanca, Co-founder of Rocket Panda Games. “It's been 109 days since the trailer released, and we're so happy that Phantom Breaker: Omnia fans will be able to experience even more 'Yah! Yah! Yah! Boom Bah Yah!'”  Story A mysterious man named Phantom works from the shadows to lure powerful fighters into perpetual battle against one another. He bestows upon them mystical weapons known as “Fu-mension Artifacts” and promises the ultimate prize to the winner: a wish. Unbeknownst to these chosen hopefuls, however, their clashes shake the fabric of space-time itself, weakening the barriers between parallel universes and bringing Phantom one step closer to his own dearest desire—the return of his destructive powers and the end of the world.  Key Features      *THE ANNOUNCER     *He's back, and his voice is just as buttery smooth as before.     *Choose From 2 Levels: Spicy and EXTRA SPICY!     *In addition to the original announcer, there are now two special commentary tracks available—original commentary by THE ANNOUNCER and fiery hot commentary by THE ANNOUNCER.     *Twenty-five Thousand 100% More Spoken Words!     *This is a lie, but it sounds great, so we're leaving it in.     *It's Free!

Phantom Breaker: Omnia Spicy Edition Confirmed…to be Extra Hot   Apr  2nd 2022         The fast-paced 2D anime fighting game by Rocket Panda Games and MAGES reaches 300,000 SHU on the Scoville Scale  El Habanero, Calif. - April 1, 2022 - Publisher Rocket Panda Games and developer MAGES have unveiled the latest update to Phantom Breaker: Omnia, and it's dangerously saucy.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrOnmrpc5lk  In collaboration with THE ANNOUNCER, Rocket Panda Games is pleased to present the Spicy Edition! This update will come with two scorching new levels of commentary and will be available on all platforms this summer for the listed price of AB-SO-LUTE-LY NOTHING. No, we didn't forget to cut and paste that info in. It's so free that THE ANNOUNCER screamed “Medic!!!” just on principle. “You said you wanted more, and we listened!” said Gail Salamanca, Co-founder of Rocket Panda Games. “It's been 109 days since the trailer released, and we're so happy that Phantom Breaker: Omnia fans will be able to experience even more 'Yah! Yah! Yah! Boom Bah Yah!'”  Story A mysterious man named Phantom works from the shadows to lure powerful fighters into perpetual battle against one another. He bestows upon them mystical weapons known as “Fu-mension Artifacts” and promises the ultimate prize to the winner: a wish. Unbeknownst to these chosen hopefuls, however, their clashes shake the fabric of space-time itself, weakening the barriers between parallel universes and bringing Phantom one step closer to his own dearest desire—the return of his destructive powers and the end of the world.

This update will come with two scorching new levels of commentary and will be available on all platforms this summer for the listed price of AB-SO-LUTE-LY NOTHING. No, we didn't forget to cut and paste that info in. It's so free that THE ANNOUNCER screamed “Medic!!!” just on principle. “You said you wanted more, and we listened!” said Gail Salamanca, Co-founder of Rocket Panda Games. “It's been 109 days since the trailer released, and we're so happy that Phantom Breaker: Omnia fans will be able to experience even more 'Yah! Yah! Yah! Boom Bah Yah!'”  Story A mysterious man named Phantom works from the shadows to lure powerful fighters into perpetual battle against one another. He bestows upon them mystical weapons known as “Fu-mension Artifacts” and promises the ultimate prize to the winner: a wish. Unbeknownst to these chosen hopefuls, however, their clashes shake the fabric of space-time itself, weakening the barriers between parallel universes and bringing Phantom one step closer to his own dearest desire—the return of his destructive powers and the end of the world.

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Theme Song Band Mili   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022          International indie rockers Mili made their anisong debut in the 2016 series Bloodivores and have since gone on to contribute themes for  Goblin Slayer, Gleipnir, amd Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045. The group's newest song ""Paper Bouquet"" will be featured as the opening theme in the upcoming anime series The Executioner and Her Way of Life and is available digitally today.    Anime News Network had the opportunity to interview the group's lead vocalist Cassie Wei about the band's unique sound, her anime and manga recommendations, and the upcoming series.    The group 'Mili' formed in 2012, can you tell us how you each met and about the formation of the group?   Cassie Wei: Around a year or two before Mili was formed, I was making covers of Kasai's Vocaloid songs and posting them on YouTube. At the time, I was in high school, and Kasai was using a different name. When he saw my videos, he got in contact with me through Twitter. He invited me to join his new unit afterwards. It sounded fun so I immediately said yes (laughs). It genuinely has been a lot of fun.    After that, Kasai invited some of his former bandmates: bassist Yukihito and drummer Shoto. Together, we formed Mili, and when we were producing our first album, we had the opportunity to bring the illustrator Ao on board.    Can you talk about your group name, ""Mili"" and the inspiration from the Grimm fairytale? How does the group name represent your music?   Cassie: The Grimm fairytale ""Dear Mili"" is honestly quite an offbeat story, in my opinion (laughs). The message isn't clear, nor does it tell you what the protagonist Mili was feeling, or whether the ending was happy or bad. Yet it's a mysterious tale through which you can feel a sense of beauty. I think that this beautiful yet eerily bizarre aspect is a good match for our style of music.    Vocalist Cassie Wei is multi-talented; on top of singing she also has a degree in software engineering. Does she still have goals of creating computer games in the future?   Cassie: Lately, I've been wanting to express my values in a more easy-to-digest format. I love games, of course, and I think it's an excellent medium for deep-diving into a world, but it takes such a long time before you can show your work to other people, so I realized it was unsuited for me. There are so many ideas in my head that I want to express and so many messages I want to convey that it all threatens to get buried. Every day I think of some new kind of story. If I spend too much time on each individual thing, then (as far as I am concerned) I would turn into someone who can't give shape to their ideas. I think that's why I made the switch to writing songs.    How would you describe the mood of your song ""Paper Bouquet?""   Cassie: Fortitude, intensity, and a bit of poignancy, I suppose?    Were there any notes or directions provided by the anime staff for creating the song?   Cassie: We received some advice for the composition from the production side, but they generally left things up to Mili. I have so much gratitude for the production staff who believed in our sound.    Are any of the members anime, manga, or light novel fans? What are some of your favorites?   Cassie: All the members are otaku of some kind (laughs). Although everyone's into different genres. When I was in elementary school, I watched so much anime every day, and I'd even read manga in the bathtub. These days, I'm a fan of Shūzō Oshimi's Blood on the Tracks. I think it's great how it expresses the story and the feelings of the characters not through words but through images.     Are there any anime theme songs that you consider 'iconic' or that you listen to often?   Cassie: I'm quite the anime otaku, so there are way too many songs for comfort (laughs). When I was a kid, Yuki Kajiura's “Akatsuki no Kuruma” (from Mobile Suit Gundam Seed) was a masterpiece to me. Also, when I was in elementary school, I watched Destiny of the Shrine Maiden (not an anime an elementary schoolchild should watch, by the way). I was a huge fan of the ED song “Agony” performed by KOTOKO.    What bands or musicians do you consider major influences?   Cassie: There isn't a specific artist, but I've been influenced a lot by anisongs and J-Pop as a genre. Although I'm Canadian, I've loved anime and games since I was a kid, so I generally listened to anisongs. Anisongs are distinctive for their strong melodies. You don't find songs with such a feeling of presence in the west. It was very novel to me as a child. I suppose that's why Mili songs always have a strong melody line? My flashy melodies complement Kasai's classic and rock band experience. I think that's the source of Mili's unique sound today.    Can you recommend “The Executioner and Her Way of Life” to the western audience？   Cassie: I've seen the completed footage with my own eyes. So I can say this: The animation is sooooo pretty! It's a very impressive show, well worth watching, with solid action scenes. The musical score is a perfect match for each scene, which raises the excitement.    It's an easy anime to get into while also having a very intricate plot and setting. There's a lot of depth to the story. I can absolutely recommend it to people who love fantasy. Even people who don't have much interest in orthodox fantasy or the isekai genre ought to take the opportunity to watch it. It might become a new love for you.    Make sure to watch The Executioner and Her Way of Life!    The Executioner and Her Way of Life will stream on HIDIVE   Readers can find Mili on YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music.     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Theme Song Band Mili   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022          International indie rockers Mili made their anisong debut in the 2016 series Bloodivores and have since gone on to contribute themes for  Goblin Slayer, Gleipnir, amd Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045. The group's newest song ""Paper Bouquet"" will be featured as the opening theme in the upcoming anime series The Executioner and Her Way of Life and is available digitally today.    Anime News Network had the opportunity to interview the group's lead vocalist Cassie Wei about the band's unique sound, her anime and manga recommendations, and the upcoming series.    The group 'Mili' formed in 2012, can you tell us how you each met and about the formation of the group?   Cassie Wei: Around a year or two before Mili was formed, I was making covers of Kasai's Vocaloid songs and posting them on YouTube. At the time, I was in high school, and Kasai was using a different name. When he saw my videos, he got in contact with me through Twitter. He invited me to join his new unit afterwards. It sounded fun so I immediately said yes (laughs). It genuinely has been a lot of fun.    After that, Kasai invited some of his former bandmates: bassist Yukihito and drummer Shoto. Together, we formed Mili, and when we were producing our first album, we had the opportunity to bring the illustrator Ao on board.    Can you talk about your group name, ""Mili"" and the inspiration from the Grimm fairytale? How does the group name represent your music?   Cassie: The Grimm fairytale ""Dear Mili"" is honestly quite an offbeat story, in my opinion (laughs). The message isn't clear, nor does it tell you what the protagonist Mili was feeling, or whether the ending was happy or bad. Yet it's a mysterious tale through which you can feel a sense of beauty. I think that this beautiful yet eerily bizarre aspect is a good match for our style of music.    Vocalist Cassie Wei is multi-talented; on top of singing she also has a degree in software engineering. Does she still have goals of creating computer games in the future?   Cassie: Lately, I've been wanting to express my values in a more easy-to-digest format. I love games, of course, and I think it's an excellent medium for deep-diving into a world, but it takes such a long time before you can show your work to other people, so I realized it was unsuited for me. There are so many ideas in my head that I want to express and so many messages I want to convey that it all threatens to get buried. Every day I think of some new kind of story. If I spend too much time on each individual thing, then (as far as I am concerned) I would turn into someone who can't give shape to their ideas. I think that's why I made the switch to writing songs.    How would you describe the mood of your song ""Paper Bouquet?""   Cassie: Fortitude, intensity, and a bit of poignancy, I suppose?    Were there any notes or directions provided by the anime staff for creating the song?   Cassie: We received some advice for the composition from the production side, but they generally left things up to Mili. I have so much gratitude for the production staff who believed in our sound.    Are any of the members anime, manga, or light novel fans? What are some of your favorites?   Cassie: All the members are otaku of some kind (laughs). Although everyone's into different genres. When I was in elementary school, I watched so much anime every day, and I'd even read manga in the bathtub. These days, I'm a fan of Shūzō Oshimi's Blood on the Tracks. I think it's great how it expresses the story and the feelings of the characters not through words but through images.     Are there any anime theme songs that you consider 'iconic' or that you listen to often?   Cassie: I'm quite the anime otaku, so there are way too many songs for comfort (laughs). When I was a kid, Yuki Kajiura's “Akatsuki no Kuruma” (from Mobile Suit Gundam Seed) was a masterpiece to me. Also, when I was in elementary school, I watched Destiny of the Shrine Maiden (not an anime an elementary schoolchild should watch, by the way). I was a huge fan of the ED song “Agony” performed by KOTOKO.    What bands or musicians do you consider major influences?   Cassie: There isn't a specific artist, but I've been influenced a lot by anisongs and J-Pop as a genre. Although I'm Canadian, I've loved anime and games since I was a kid, so I generally listened to anisongs. Anisongs are distinctive for their strong melodies. You don't find songs with such a feeling of presence in the west. It was very novel to me as a child. I suppose that's why Mili songs always have a strong melody line? My flashy melodies complement Kasai's classic and rock band experience. I think that's the source of Mili's unique sound today.    Can you recommend “The Executioner and Her Way of Life” to the western audience？   Cassie: I've seen the completed footage with my own eyes. So I can say this: The animation is sooooo pretty! It's a very impressive show, well worth watching, with solid action scenes. The musical score is a perfect match for each scene, which raises the excitement.    It's an easy anime to get into while also having a very intricate plot and setting. There's a lot of depth to the story. I can absolutely recommend it to people who love fantasy. Even people who don't have much interest in orthodox fantasy or the isekai genre ought to take the opportunity to watch it. It might become a new love for you.

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Theme Song Band Mili   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022          International indie rockers Mili made their anisong debut in the 2016 series Bloodivores and have since gone on to contribute themes for  Goblin Slayer, Gleipnir, amd Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045. The group's newest song ""Paper Bouquet"" will be featured as the opening theme in the upcoming anime series The Executioner and Her Way of Life and is available digitally today.    Anime News Network had the opportunity to interview the group's lead vocalist Cassie Wei about the band's unique sound, her anime and manga recommendations, and the upcoming series.    The group 'Mili' formed in 2012, can you tell us how you each met and about the formation of the group?   Cassie Wei: Around a year or two before Mili was formed, I was making covers of Kasai's Vocaloid songs and posting them on YouTube. At the time, I was in high school, and Kasai was using a different name. When he saw my videos, he got in contact with me through Twitter. He invited me to join his new unit afterwards. It sounded fun so I immediately said yes (laughs). It genuinely has been a lot of fun.    After that, Kasai invited some of his former bandmates: bassist Yukihito and drummer Shoto. Together, we formed Mili, and when we were producing our first album, we had the opportunity to bring the illustrator Ao on board.    Can you talk about your group name, ""Mili"" and the inspiration from the Grimm fairytale? How does the group name represent your music?   Cassie: The Grimm fairytale ""Dear Mili"" is honestly quite an offbeat story, in my opinion (laughs). The message isn't clear, nor does it tell you what the protagonist Mili was feeling, or whether the ending was happy or bad. Yet it's a mysterious tale through which you can feel a sense of beauty. I think that this beautiful yet eerily bizarre aspect is a good match for our style of music.    Vocalist Cassie Wei is multi-talented; on top of singing she also has a degree in software engineering. Does she still have goals of creating computer games in the future?   Cassie: Lately, I've been wanting to express my values in a more easy-to-digest format. I love games, of course, and I think it's an excellent medium for deep-diving into a world, but it takes such a long time before you can show your work to other people, so I realized it was unsuited for me.

I have so much gratitude for the production staff who believed in our sound.    Are any of the members anime, manga, or light novel fans? What are some of your favorites?   Cassie: All the members are otaku of some kind (laughs). Although everyone's into different genres. When I was in elementary school, I watched so much anime every day, and I'd even read manga in the bathtub. These days, I'm a fan of Shūzō Oshimi's Blood on the Tracks. I think it's great how it expresses the story and the feelings of the characters not through words but through images.     Are there any anime theme songs that you consider 'iconic' or that you listen to often?   Cassie: I'm quite the anime otaku, so there are way too many songs for comfort (laughs). When I was a kid, Yuki Kajiura's “Akatsuki no Kuruma” (from Mobile Suit Gundam Seed) was a masterpiece to me. Also, when I was in elementary school, I watched Destiny of the Shrine Maiden (not an anime an elementary schoolchild should watch, by the way). I was a huge fan of the ED song “Agony” performed by KOTOKO.    What bands or musicians do you consider major influences?   Cassie: There isn't a specific artist, but I've been influenced a lot by anisongs and J-Pop as a genre. Although I'm Canadian, I've loved anime and games since I was a kid, so I generally listened to anisongs. Anisongs are distinctive for their strong melodies. You don't find songs with such a feeling of presence in the west. It was very novel to me as a child. I suppose that's why Mili songs always have a strong melody line? My flashy melodies complement Kasai's classic and rock band experience. I think that's the source of Mili's unique sound today.    Can you recommend “The Executioner and Her Way of Life” to the western audience？   Cassie: I've seen the completed footage with my own eyes. So I can say this: The animation is sooooo pretty! It's a very impressive show, well worth watching, with solid action scenes. The musical score is a perfect match for each scene, which raises the excitement.    It's an easy anime to get into while also having a very intricate plot and setting. There's a lot of depth to the story. I can absolutely recommend it to people who love fantasy. Even people who don't have much interest in orthodox fantasy or the isekai genre ought to take the opportunity to watch it. It might become a new love for you.    Make sure to watch The Executioner and Her Way of Life!    The Executioner and Her Way of Life will stream on HIDIVE   Readers can find Mili on YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music.     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Theme Song Band Mili   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022          International indie rockers Mili made their anisong debut in the 2016 series Bloodivores and have since gone on to contribute themes for  Goblin Slayer, Gleipnir, amd Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045. The group's newest song ""Paper Bouquet"" will be featured as the opening theme in the upcoming anime series The Executioner and Her Way of Life and is available digitally today.    Anime News Network had the opportunity to interview the group's lead vocalist Cassie Wei about the band's unique sound, her anime and manga recommendations, and the upcoming series.    The group 'Mili' formed in 2012, can you tell us how you each met and about the formation of the group?   Cassie Wei: Around a year or two before Mili was formed, I was making covers of Kasai's Vocaloid songs and posting them on YouTube. At the time, I was in high school, and Kasai was using a different name. When he saw my videos, he got in contact with me through Twitter. He invited me to join his new unit afterwards. It sounded fun so I immediately said yes (laughs). It genuinely has been a lot of fun.    After that, Kasai invited some of his former bandmates: bassist Yukihito and drummer Shoto. Together, we formed Mili, and when we were producing our first album, we had the opportunity to bring the illustrator Ao on board.    Can you talk about your group name, ""Mili"" and the inspiration from the Grimm fairytale? How does the group name represent your music?   Cassie: The Grimm fairytale ""Dear Mili"" is honestly quite an offbeat story, in my opinion (laughs). The message isn't clear, nor does it tell you what the protagonist Mili was feeling, or whether the ending was happy or bad. Yet it's a mysterious tale through which you can feel a sense of beauty. I think that this beautiful yet eerily bizarre aspect is a good match for our style of music.    Vocalist Cassie Wei is multi-talented; on top of singing she also has a degree in software engineering. Does she still have goals of creating computer games in the future?   Cassie: Lately, I've been wanting to express my values in a more easy-to-digest format. I love games, of course, and I think it's an excellent medium for deep-diving into a world, but it takes such a long time before you can show your work to other people, so I realized it was unsuited for me. There are so many ideas in my head that I want to express and so many messages I want to convey that it all threatens to get buried. Every day I think of some new kind of story. If I spend too much time on each individual thing, then (as far as I am concerned) I would turn into someone who can't give shape to their ideas. I think that's why I made the switch to writing songs.    How would you describe the mood of your song ""Paper Bouquet?""   Cassie: Fortitude, intensity, and a bit of poignancy, I suppose?    Were there any notes or directions provided by the anime staff for creating the song?   Cassie: We received some advice for the composition from the production side, but they generally left things up to Mili. I have so much gratitude for the production staff who believed in our sound.    Are any of the members anime, manga, or light novel fans? What are some of your favorites?   Cassie: All the members are otaku of some kind (laughs). Although everyone's into different genres. When I was in elementary school, I watched so much anime every day, and I'd even read manga in the bathtub. These days, I'm a fan of Shūzō Oshimi's Blood on the Tracks.

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Theme Song Band Mili   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022          International indie rockers Mili made their anisong debut in the 2016 series Bloodivores and have since gone on to contribute themes for  Goblin Slayer, Gleipnir, amd Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045. The group's newest song ""Paper Bouquet"" will be featured as the opening theme in the upcoming anime series The Executioner and Her Way of Life and is available digitally today.    Anime News Network had the opportunity to interview the group's lead vocalist Cassie Wei about the band's unique sound, her anime and manga recommendations, and the upcoming series.    The group 'Mili' formed in 2012, can you tell us how you each met and about the formation of the group?   Cassie Wei: Around a year or two before Mili was formed, I was making covers of Kasai's Vocaloid songs and posting them on YouTube. At the time, I was in high school, and Kasai was using a different name. When he saw my videos, he got in contact with me through Twitter. He invited me to join his new unit afterwards. It sounded fun so I immediately said yes (laughs). It genuinely has been a lot of fun.    After that, Kasai invited some of his former bandmates: bassist Yukihito and drummer Shoto. Together, we formed Mili, and when we were producing our first album, we had the opportunity to bring the illustrator Ao on board.    Can you talk about your group name, ""Mili"" and the inspiration from the Grimm fairytale? How does the group name represent your music?   Cassie: The Grimm fairytale ""Dear Mili"" is honestly quite an offbeat story, in my opinion (laughs). The message isn't clear, nor does it tell you what the protagonist Mili was feeling, or whether the ending was happy or bad. Yet it's a mysterious tale through which you can feel a sense of beauty. I think that this beautiful yet eerily bizarre aspect is a good match for our style of music.    Vocalist Cassie Wei is multi-talented; on top of singing she also has a degree in software engineering. Does she still have goals of creating computer games in the future?   Cassie: Lately, I've been wanting to express my values in a more easy-to-digest format. I love games, of course, and I think it's an excellent medium for deep-diving into a world, but it takes such a long time before you can show your work to other people, so I realized it was unsuited for me. There are so many ideas in my head that I want to express and so many messages I want to convey that it all threatens to get buried. Every day I think of some new kind of story. If I spend too much time on each individual thing, then (as far as I am concerned) I would turn into someone who can't give shape to their ideas. I think that's why I made the switch to writing songs.    How would you describe the mood of your song ""Paper Bouquet?""   Cassie: Fortitude, intensity, and a bit of poignancy, I suppose?    Were there any notes or directions provided by the anime staff for creating the song?   Cassie: We received some advice for the composition from the production side, but they generally left things up to Mili. I have so much gratitude for the production staff who believed in our sound.    Are any of the members anime, manga, or light novel fans? What are some of your favorites?   Cassie: All the members are otaku of some kind (laughs). Although everyone's into different genres. When I was in elementary school, I watched so much anime every day, and I'd even read manga in the bathtub. These days, I'm a fan of Shūzō Oshimi's Blood on the Tracks. I think it's great how it expresses the story and the feelings of the characters not through words but through images.     Are there any anime theme songs that you consider 'iconic' or that you listen to often?   Cassie: I'm quite the anime otaku, so there are way too many songs for comfort (laughs). When I was a kid, Yuki Kajiura's “Akatsuki no Kuruma” (from Mobile Suit Gundam Seed) was a masterpiece to me. Also, when I was in elementary school, I watched Destiny of the Shrine Maiden (not an anime an elementary schoolchild should watch, by the way). I was a huge fan of the ED song “Agony” performed by KOTOKO.    What bands or musicians do you consider major influences?   Cassie: There isn't a specific artist, but I've been influenced a lot by anisongs and J-Pop as a genre. Although I'm Canadian, I've loved anime and games since I was a kid, so I generally listened to anisongs. Anisongs are distinctive for their strong melodies. You don't find songs with such a feeling of presence in the west. It was very novel to me as a child. I suppose that's why Mili songs always have a strong melody line? My flashy melodies complement Kasai's classic and rock band experience. I think that's the source of Mili's unique sound today.    Can you recommend “The Executioner and Her Way of Life” to the western audience？   Cassie: I've seen the completed footage with my own eyes. So I can say this: The animation is sooooo pretty! It's a very impressive show, well worth watching, with solid action scenes. The musical score is a perfect match for each scene, which raises the excitement.    It's an easy anime to get into while also having a very intricate plot and setting. There's a lot of depth to the story. I can absolutely recommend it to people who love fantasy. Even people who don't have much interest in orthodox fantasy or the isekai genre ought to take the opportunity to watch it. It might become a new love for you.    Make sure to watch The Executioner and Her Way of Life!    The Executioner and Her Way of Life will stream on HIDIVE   Readers can find Mili on YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music.     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

When I was in elementary school, I watched so much anime every day, and I'd even read manga in the bathtub. These days, I'm a fan of Shūzō Oshimi's Blood on the Tracks. I think it's great how it expresses the story and the feelings of the characters not through words but through images.     Are there any anime theme songs that you consider 'iconic' or that you listen to often?   Cassie: I'm quite the anime otaku, so there are way too many songs for comfort (laughs). When I was a kid, Yuki Kajiura's “Akatsuki no Kuruma” (from Mobile Suit Gundam Seed) was a masterpiece to me. Also, when I was in elementary school, I watched Destiny of the Shrine Maiden (not an anime an elementary schoolchild should watch, by the way). I was a huge fan of the ED song “Agony” performed by KOTOKO.    What bands or musicians do you consider major influences?   Cassie: There isn't a specific artist, but I've been influenced a lot by anisongs and J-Pop as a genre. Although I'm Canadian, I've loved anime and games since I was a kid, so I generally listened to anisongs. Anisongs are distinctive for their strong melodies. You don't find songs with such a feeling of presence in the west. It was very novel to me as a child. I suppose that's why Mili songs always have a strong melody line? My flashy melodies complement Kasai's classic and rock band experience. I think that's the source of Mili's unique sound today.    Can you recommend “The Executioner and Her Way of Life” to the western audience？   Cassie: I've seen the completed footage with my own eyes. So I can say this: The animation is sooooo pretty! It's a very impressive show, well worth watching, with solid action scenes. The musical score is a perfect match for each scene, which raises the excitement.    It's an easy anime to get into while also having a very intricate plot and setting. There's a lot of depth to the story. I can absolutely recommend it to people who love fantasy. Even people who don't have much interest in orthodox fantasy or the isekai genre ought to take the opportunity to watch it. It might become a new love for you.    Make sure to watch The Executioner and Her Way of Life!

The group's newest song ""Paper Bouquet"" will be featured as the opening theme in the upcoming anime series The Executioner and Her Way of Life and is available digitally today.    Anime News Network had the opportunity to interview the group's lead vocalist Cassie Wei about the band's unique sound, her anime and manga recommendations, and the upcoming series.    The group 'Mili' formed in 2012, can you tell us how you each met and about the formation of the group?   Cassie Wei: Around a year or two before Mili was formed, I was making covers of Kasai's Vocaloid songs and posting them on YouTube. At the time, I was in high school, and Kasai was using a different name. When he saw my videos, he got in contact with me through Twitter. He invited me to join his new unit afterwards. It sounded fun so I immediately said yes (laughs). It genuinely has been a lot of fun.    After that, Kasai invited some of his former bandmates: bassist Yukihito and drummer Shoto. Together, we formed Mili, and when we were producing our first album, we had the opportunity to bring the illustrator Ao on board.    Can you talk about your group name, ""Mili"" and the inspiration from the Grimm fairytale? How does the group name represent your music?   Cassie: The Grimm fairytale ""Dear Mili"" is honestly quite an offbeat story, in my opinion (laughs). The message isn't clear, nor does it tell you what the protagonist Mili was feeling, or whether the ending was happy or bad. Yet it's a mysterious tale through which you can feel a sense of beauty. I think that this beautiful yet eerily bizarre aspect is a good match for our style of music.    Vocalist Cassie Wei is multi-talented; on top of singing she also has a degree in software engineering. Does she still have goals of creating computer games in the future?   Cassie: Lately, I've been wanting to express my values in a more easy-to-digest format. I love games, of course, and I think it's an excellent medium for deep-diving into a world, but it takes such a long time before you can show your work to other people, so I realized it was unsuited for me. There are so many ideas in my head that I want to express and so many messages I want to convey that it all threatens to get buried. Every day I think of some new kind of story. If I spend too much time on each individual thing, then (as far as I am concerned) I would turn into someone who can't give shape to their ideas. I think that's why I made the switch to writing songs.    How would you describe the mood of your song ""Paper Bouquet?""   Cassie: Fortitude, intensity, and a bit of poignancy, I suppose?    Were there any notes or directions provided by the anime staff for creating the song?   Cassie: We received some advice for the composition from the production side, but they generally left things up to Mili. I have so much gratitude for the production staff who believed in our sound.    Are any of the members anime, manga, or light novel fans? What are some of your favorites?

Titles with less than 4 votes are removed from the list but are still counted in the ranking. This explains why there may be gaps in the ""#"" column.

Titles with many votes will tend to be at the top, but this is modified a little by the ratings. In other words, the popularity is the straight average score of a title (the value in the rating column) multiplied by the number of votes.

I guess it comes from condensing one volume into two episodes but they make it pretty clear they have feelings for each other (especially Ninym) and I half wonder if Wein is trying to sell the kingdom and retire so that he can peacefully marry Ninym without anyone complaining.

I've got a few different ideas for why he is trying to sell out- and none of them have general laziness as the primary motivation. All theory, of course, so I'm quite intrigued about future revelations.

The basic idea was that Wein could use the terrain advantages to nullify the enemy numerical advantages. That's all fine, but why did the enemy general apparently do almost nothing for weeks? When he's eventually defeated he says his army is doing a full assault, why did he wait 3 weeks for this? And if the entire idea is that he can't use his full 30 000 troops to assault the mountain, where were most of his troops on the day of the assault? They can't have been assaulting the fortress since the passage are too narrow for all of them, but at the same time they weren't back in camp, did he just send them to collect flowers? Especially since, just a few days before, his camp was attacked by a small cavalry force, shouldn't he know that his camp was vulnerable to raid (how did that small force even attack his camp in the first place?).    The secret tunnel part was also pointlessly roundabout, Wein had a secret tunnel almost fully digged out but not quite finish. He then purposefully collapse another tunnel to take the enemy general mind away from the secret tunnel that general doesn't know exist? How is clearly informing your enemy that you can dig tunnel to the base of the mountain help you keep secret the fact that you can dig tunnel to the base of the mountain? Or are we suppose to think that the general is somehow so incredibly stupid that he doesn't understand that tunnel are man made and new one can therefore be made?

Ninym and Wein's relationship definitely is the most interesting part, so hopefully now that we've established Wein's skills we can get some focus on that.     Quote:     This may be something lost in adaptation but isn't Ninym actually rather busty for a woman her size? I'm not sure why she reacts so negatively to Wein's random sleep talking            She seemed rather modest based on the preceding scene imo. I think the outfit enhances her bust. At best, to me, she presented as average for her size.     meiam wrote:    Episode 1 was fine, but episode 2 felt sloppy.

He had no reason to hold back after the first few attempts failed. One would also presume he had already been trying to throw everything at them from early on as that seemed to be the height of his ""tactics"".

From what I understood the first tunnel already existed and was on the map, so the collapsed tunnel was to make them think it was closed off. He just didn't think they'd have dug a second parallel tunnel in advance. Though that begs the question of how much time they had to do that if clearing the collapsed tunnel would have taken months.

Apparently the anime's reduced her chest size compared to the Light Novel illustrations (although apparently they got bigger as the series went on).

My guess is that it is because of her heritage as a Flahm.    Looking at the map (shown in one of the episodes), it's shown Natra is at the top; to the east is the massive Empire and to the south is a mountain range that goes most of the way to the southern coast (making Natra one of the few crossing points for goods to go into and out of the Empire - sorry folks, there is some statecraft/economics in the series, albeit lesser than Realist Hero). Whereas Flahm are not seen badly in Natra or the Empire the way they are seen in the Western countries is beyond racist. In one event likely to be covered in the series, spoiler[Wein is invited by a King to go hunting; and when he finds out that said King was planning on hunting some Flahm and hoped that Wein would allow him to hunt Ninym, he promptly executes him.]   Given the prevailing attitude to the Flahm and Natra's position as essentially a buffer state for the Empire in case of war, Ninym probably considers that her marrying Wein would cause Natra's standing to weaken to a point where the western countries collectively declare war on the kingdom. Hence why, despite her own clear feelings through just two episodes, she rejects Falanya's attempted matchmaking so vehemently.   As for her breasts, I remember her being self-conscious of them in volume 1. It seems to be a running joke that they get larger in the illustrations of each progressive volume?

Best laid plans of mice and men and all that.   But in their attempt to build the tunnel, the miners found a new vein of gold...  Vein, vain? why do I feel Wein should be pronounced as if it was ""Vein""?... so Wein got his money in the end and a new country for ""not"" conquering.   I'm loving this series and its very RTS video game approach to war. ""The Anime Protagonist who was too lazy to fail""; If he spent all his effort into trying to succeed he'd fail but as he's trying to fail then he'll surely succeed? I can accept it.   I was worried that the show would break the fine line between out and out success and outright failure but episode 2 illuminates the path forward: Greater successes yields greater rewards but also greater costs.   An empire built out of ""it seemed like a necessary step at the time"". Like Utawarerumono but with no Godzilla knockoffs.

When he's eventually defeated he says his army is doing a full assault, why did he wait 3 weeks for this? And if the entire idea is that he can't use his full 30 000 troops to assault the mountain, where were most of his troops on the day of the assault? They can't have been assaulting the fortress since the passage are too narrow for all of them, but at the same time they weren't back in camp, did he just send them to collect flowers? Especially since, just a few days before, his camp was attacked by a small cavalry force, shouldn't he know that his camp was vulnerable to raid (how did that small force even attack his camp in the first place?).           We don't know that he did nothing for weeks.  Presumably he just kept attacking with varying tactics, but we weren't shown two weeks of his failures, since the episode is only 20 min.  You have to remember that Drawood is 1) full of pride and delusions of superiority, and 2) an idiot who lets that pride rule his actions.  It was a blow to his ego that he was being stymied by such a small force, and that prevented him from using his troops' numbers more to his advantage at least as much as the terrain did (his ""all-out assault"" added ladders and probably other ways for more of his troops to attack at once).  So we also don't know how many of his troops were actively engaged in the all-out assault and how many were left in camp as reinforcements. But that doesn't matter, since Wein & Co. infiltrated in enemy uniforms and were perceived as part of those troops.  In fact if no troops were left in camp, it would've been more suspicious for them to show up.   As to how the camp was attacked previously, well, it was night, they weren't expecting a force of any size to attack so their security was lax, and once it began they were fooled into believing a much larger force was upon them, creating even more panic and chaos.  Plus Drawood seemed to be frozen into inaction by fear and by simply not being used to losing.   None of this is unrealistic.  Wars are lost all the time because of people not behaving with Vulcan logic as you always expect all characters to behave.  Generals can get fooled.  Egos can trump best tactics and thus lead to failure.  Show me a war where woulda, shoulda, coulda didn't come into play at one point or another for at least one side of the conflict.  You're always going to find one moron who wants to attack Russia in winter  (yeah, yeah, I know. It's a meme, don't @ me).

He just didn't think they'd have dug a second parallel tunnel in advance. Though that begs the question of how much time they had to do that if clearing the collapsed tunnel would have taken months.           I don't think Drawood thought they could either dig a new tunnel or excavate the collapsed one.  He's a military man, and likely doesn't know from mining or how efficient or not miners could be with that particular geology. Hell, it's not unreasonable to think he forgot they had actual miners on site, being so focused on the troops aspect of the siege.  So his ""months"" to clear could be way off, or clearing a collapsed tunnel may present more difficult problems than digging a new one, or both.

All possible, but then it reduce the tactical part of the show to ""the main character win because he's up against morons"" which I never find really interesting, especially not when they constantly heap praise on the main character for... not being the moron in a room full of moron. It's like watching a race between Usain Bolt and a toddler, no fun.

In the case of the first episode it has almost skipped the part of the imperial ambasador ( in the anime it covers around 1 minute between 2 flashbacks, in the LN is a 25% of the first, a full episode).   in the case of the second is even worse, they skipped spoiler[the full negotitation with a character that is important in the future and the relation between the two factions of marden goverment]   aditionaly in the war they omited some extremely important parts spoiler[ like that all the plans of wein involve both phisical and sicological presure. in the case of the assault they omited the part that 5000 soldiers where at the back of the mountain to look out possible scape routes and the part that the ""discovery"" of the cave was responsability of wein spies so they could make the ambush.   another part that they fully omited is that untill one week after the start of the war the marden soldiers didn't use any siege weapon, and that for the next two weeks they where building them and waiting for getting some from home.   another one is the part with the fires, yes, they added it to the anime, but what they omited is that they did that multiple times and just the  day before the final assault they  burned the supplies of the marden army]   i only hope they slow down the adaptation pace and we dont have anothe seirei gensouki case ( at least with the opening we can see that they only adapted until the third LN, lets see what happens)      Back to top                  Aerodynamic41    Joined: 20 Oct 2015 		    Posts: 131       Posted: Thu Jan 20, 2022 4:40 am              Lirsen wrote:    ( at least with the opening we can see that they only adapted until the third LN, lets see what happens)            I think it's more than 3 volumes.

I guess it comes from condensing one volume into two episodes but they make it pretty clear they have feelings for each other (especially Ninym) and I half wonder if Wein is trying to sell the kingdom and retire so that he can peacefully marry Ninym without anyone complaining.

I've got a few different ideas for why he is trying to sell out- and none of them have general laziness as the primary motivation. All theory, of course, so I'm quite intrigued about future revelations.

The basic idea was that Wein could use the terrain advantages to nullify the enemy numerical advantages. That's all fine, but why did the enemy general apparently do almost nothing for weeks? When he's eventually defeated he says his army is doing a full assault, why did he wait 3 weeks for this? And if the entire idea is that he can't use his full 30 000 troops to assault the mountain, where were most of his troops on the day of the assault? They can't have been assaulting the fortress since the passage are too narrow for all of them, but at the same time they weren't back in camp, did he just send them to collect flowers? Especially since, just a few days before, his camp was attacked by a small cavalry force, shouldn't he know that his camp was vulnerable to raid (how did that small force even attack his camp in the first place?).    The secret tunnel part was also pointlessly roundabout, Wein had a secret tunnel almost fully digged out but not quite finish. He then purposefully collapse another tunnel to take the enemy general mind away from the secret tunnel that general doesn't know exist? How is clearly informing your enemy that you can dig tunnel to the base of the mountain help you keep secret the fact that you can dig tunnel to the base of the mountain? Or are we suppose to think that the general is somehow so incredibly stupid that he doesn't understand that tunnel are man made and new one can therefore be made?

Ninym and Wein's relationship definitely is the most interesting part, so hopefully now that we've established Wein's skills we can get some focus on that.     Quote:     This may be something lost in adaptation but isn't Ninym actually rather busty for a woman her size? I'm not sure why she reacts so negatively to Wein's random sleep talking            She seemed rather modest based on the preceding scene imo. I think the outfit enhances her bust. At best, to me, she presented as average for her size.     meiam wrote:    Episode 1 was fine, but episode 2 felt sloppy.

He had no reason to hold back after the first few attempts failed. One would also presume he had already been trying to throw everything at them from early on as that seemed to be the height of his ""tactics"".

From what I understood the first tunnel already existed and was on the map, so the collapsed tunnel was to make them think it was closed off. He just didn't think they'd have dug a second parallel tunnel in advance. Though that begs the question of how much time they had to do that if clearing the collapsed tunnel would have taken months.

Apparently the anime's reduced her chest size compared to the Light Novel illustrations (although apparently they got bigger as the series went on).

My guess is that it is because of her heritage as a Flahm.    Looking at the map (shown in one of the episodes), it's shown Natra is at the top; to the east is the massive Empire and to the south is a mountain range that goes most of the way to the southern coast (making Natra one of the few crossing points for goods to go into and out of the Empire - sorry folks, there is some statecraft/economics in the series, albeit lesser than Realist Hero). Whereas Flahm are not seen badly in Natra or the Empire the way they are seen in the Western countries is beyond racist. In one event likely to be covered in the series, spoiler[Wein is invited by a King to go hunting; and when he finds out that said King was planning on hunting some Flahm and hoped that Wein would allow him to hunt Ninym, he promptly executes him.]   Given the prevailing attitude to the Flahm and Natra's position as essentially a buffer state for the Empire in case of war, Ninym probably considers that her marrying Wein would cause Natra's standing to weaken to a point where the western countries collectively declare war on the kingdom. Hence why, despite her own clear feelings through just two episodes, she rejects Falanya's attempted matchmaking so vehemently.   As for her breasts, I remember her being self-conscious of them in volume 1. It seems to be a running joke that they get larger in the illustrations of each progressive volume?

Best laid plans of mice and men and all that.   But in their attempt to build the tunnel, the miners found a new vein of gold...  Vein, vain? why do I feel Wein should be pronounced as if it was ""Vein""?... so Wein got his money in the end and a new country for ""not"" conquering.   I'm loving this series and its very RTS video game approach to war. ""The Anime Protagonist who was too lazy to fail""; If he spent all his effort into trying to succeed he'd fail but as he's trying to fail then he'll surely succeed? I can accept it.   I was worried that the show would break the fine line between out and out success and outright failure but episode 2 illuminates the path forward: Greater successes yields greater rewards but also greater costs.   An empire built out of ""it seemed like a necessary step at the time"". Like Utawarerumono but with no Godzilla knockoffs.

We don't know that he did nothing for weeks.  Presumably he just kept attacking with varying tactics, but we weren't shown two weeks of his failures, since the episode is only 20 min.  You have to remember that Drawood is 1) full of pride and delusions of superiority, and 2) an idiot who lets that pride rule his actions.  It was a blow to his ego that he was being stymied by such a small force, and that prevented him from using his troops' numbers more to his advantage at least as much as the terrain did (his ""all-out assault"" added ladders and probably other ways for more of his troops to attack at once).  So we also don't know how many of his troops were actively engaged in the all-out assault and how many were left in camp as reinforcements. But that doesn't matter, since Wein & Co. infiltrated in enemy uniforms and were perceived as part of those troops.  In fact if no troops were left in camp, it would've been more suspicious for them to show up.   As to how the camp was attacked previously, well, it was night, they weren't expecting a force of any size to attack so their security was lax, and once it began they were fooled into believing a much larger force was upon them, creating even more panic and chaos.  Plus Drawood seemed to be frozen into inaction by fear and by simply not being used to losing.   None of this is unrealistic.  Wars are lost all the time because of people not behaving with Vulcan logic as you always expect all characters to behave.  Generals can get fooled.  Egos can trump best tactics and thus lead to failure.  Show me a war where woulda, shoulda, coulda didn't come into play at one point or another for at least one side of the conflict.  You're always going to find one moron who wants to attack Russia in winter  (yeah, yeah, I know. It's a meme, don't @ me).

I don't think Drawood thought they could either dig a new tunnel or excavate the collapsed one.  He's a military man, and likely doesn't know from mining or how efficient or not miners could be with that particular geology. Hell, it's not unreasonable to think he forgot they had actual miners on site, being so focused on the troops aspect of the siege.  So his ""months"" to clear could be way off, or clearing a collapsed tunnel may present more difficult problems than digging a new one, or both.

All possible, but then it reduce the tactical part of the show to ""the main character win because he's up against morons"" which I never find really interesting, especially not when they constantly heap praise on the main character for... not being the moron in a room full of moron. It's like watching a race between Usain Bolt and a toddler, no fun.

In the case of the first episode it has almost skipped the part of the imperial ambasador ( in the anime it covers around 1 minute between 2 flashbacks, in the LN is a 25% of the first, a full episode).   in the case of the second is even worse, they skipped spoiler[the full negotitation with a character that is important in the future and the relation between the two factions of marden goverment]   aditionaly in the war they omited some extremely important parts spoiler[ like that all the plans of wein involve both phisical and sicological presure. in the case of the assault they omited the part that 5000 soldiers where at the back of the mountain to look out possible scape routes and the part that the ""discovery"" of the cave was responsability of wein spies so they could make the ambush.   another part that they fully omited is that untill one week after the start of the war the marden soldiers didn't use any siege weapon, and that for the next two weeks they where building them and waiting for getting some from home.   another one is the part with the fires, yes, they added it to the anime, but what they omited is that they did that multiple times and just the  day before the final assault they  burned the supplies of the marden army]   i only hope they slow down the adaptation pace and we dont have anothe seirei gensouki case ( at least with the opening we can see that they only adapted until the third LN, lets see what happens)      Back to top                  Aerodynamic41    Joined: 20 Oct 2015 		    Posts: 131       Posted: Thu Jan 20, 2022 4:40 am              Lirsen wrote:    ( at least with the opening we can see that they only adapted until the third LN, lets see what happens)            I think it's more than 3 volumes.

I've got a few different ideas for why he is trying to sell out- and none of them have general laziness as the primary motivation. All theory, of course, so I'm quite intrigued about future revelations.

The basic idea was that Wein could use the terrain advantages to nullify the enemy numerical advantages. That's all fine, but why did the enemy general apparently do almost nothing for weeks? When he's eventually defeated he says his army is doing a full assault, why did he wait 3 weeks for this? And if the entire idea is that he can't use his full 30 000 troops to assault the mountain, where were most of his troops on the day of the assault? They can't have been assaulting the fortress since the passage are too narrow for all of them, but at the same time they weren't back in camp, did he just send them to collect flowers? Especially since, just a few days before, his camp was attacked by a small cavalry force, shouldn't he know that his camp was vulnerable to raid (how did that small force even attack his camp in the first place?).    The secret tunnel part was also pointlessly roundabout, Wein had a secret tunnel almost fully digged out but not quite finish. He then purposefully collapse another tunnel to take the enemy general mind away from the secret tunnel that general doesn't know exist? How is clearly informing your enemy that you can dig tunnel to the base of the mountain help you keep secret the fact that you can dig tunnel to the base of the mountain? Or are we suppose to think that the general is somehow so incredibly stupid that he doesn't understand that tunnel are man made and new one can therefore be made?

Ninym and Wein's relationship definitely is the most interesting part, so hopefully now that we've established Wein's skills we can get some focus on that.     Quote:     This may be something lost in adaptation but isn't Ninym actually rather busty for a woman her size? I'm not sure why she reacts so negatively to Wein's random sleep talking            She seemed rather modest based on the preceding scene imo. I think the outfit enhances her bust. At best, to me, she presented as average for her size.     meiam wrote:    Episode 1 was fine, but episode 2 felt sloppy.

He had no reason to hold back after the first few attempts failed. One would also presume he had already been trying to throw everything at them from early on as that seemed to be the height of his ""tactics"".

From what I understood the first tunnel already existed and was on the map, so the collapsed tunnel was to make them think it was closed off. He just didn't think they'd have dug a second parallel tunnel in advance. Though that begs the question of how much time they had to do that if clearing the collapsed tunnel would have taken months.

My guess is that it is because of her heritage as a Flahm.    Looking at the map (shown in one of the episodes), it's shown Natra is at the top; to the east is the massive Empire and to the south is a mountain range that goes most of the way to the southern coast (making Natra one of the few crossing points for goods to go into and out of the Empire - sorry folks, there is some statecraft/economics in the series, albeit lesser than Realist Hero). Whereas Flahm are not seen badly in Natra or the Empire the way they are seen in the Western countries is beyond racist. In one event likely to be covered in the series, spoiler[Wein is invited by a King to go hunting; and when he finds out that said King was planning on hunting some Flahm and hoped that Wein would allow him to hunt Ninym, he promptly executes him.]   Given the prevailing attitude to the Flahm and Natra's position as essentially a buffer state for the Empire in case of war, Ninym probably considers that her marrying Wein would cause Natra's standing to weaken to a point where the western countries collectively declare war on the kingdom. Hence why, despite her own clear feelings through just two episodes, she rejects Falanya's attempted matchmaking so vehemently.   As for her breasts, I remember her being self-conscious of them in volume 1. It seems to be a running joke that they get larger in the illustrations of each progressive volume?

Best laid plans of mice and men and all that.   But in their attempt to build the tunnel, the miners found a new vein of gold...  Vein, vain? why do I feel Wein should be pronounced as if it was ""Vein""?... so Wein got his money in the end and a new country for ""not"" conquering.   I'm loving this series and its very RTS video game approach to war. ""The Anime Protagonist who was too lazy to fail""; If he spent all his effort into trying to succeed he'd fail but as he's trying to fail then he'll surely succeed? I can accept it.   I was worried that the show would break the fine line between out and out success and outright failure but episode 2 illuminates the path forward: Greater successes yields greater rewards but also greater costs.   An empire built out of ""it seemed like a necessary step at the time"". Like Utawarerumono but with no Godzilla knockoffs.

We don't know that he did nothing for weeks.  Presumably he just kept attacking with varying tactics, but we weren't shown two weeks of his failures, since the episode is only 20 min.  You have to remember that Drawood is 1) full of pride and delusions of superiority, and 2) an idiot who lets that pride rule his actions.  It was a blow to his ego that he was being stymied by such a small force, and that prevented him from using his troops' numbers more to his advantage at least as much as the terrain did (his ""all-out assault"" added ladders and probably other ways for more of his troops to attack at once).  So we also don't know how many of his troops were actively engaged in the all-out assault and how many were left in camp as reinforcements. But that doesn't matter, since Wein & Co. infiltrated in enemy uniforms and were perceived as part of those troops.  In fact if no troops were left in camp, it would've been more suspicious for them to show up.   As to how the camp was attacked previously, well, it was night, they weren't expecting a force of any size to attack so their security was lax, and once it began they were fooled into believing a much larger force was upon them, creating even more panic and chaos.  Plus Drawood seemed to be frozen into inaction by fear and by simply not being used to losing.   None of this is unrealistic.  Wars are lost all the time because of people not behaving with Vulcan logic as you always expect all characters to behave.  Generals can get fooled.  Egos can trump best tactics and thus lead to failure.  Show me a war where woulda, shoulda, coulda didn't come into play at one point or another for at least one side of the conflict.  You're always going to find one moron who wants to attack Russia in winter  (yeah, yeah, I know. It's a meme, don't @ me).

He just didn't think they'd have dug a second parallel tunnel in advance. Though that begs the question of how much time they had to do that if clearing the collapsed tunnel would have taken months.           I don't think Drawood thought they could either dig a new tunnel or excavate the collapsed one.  He's a military man, and likely doesn't know from mining or how efficient or not miners could be with that particular geology. Hell, it's not unreasonable to think he forgot they had actual miners on site, being so focused on the troops aspect of the siege.  So his ""months"" to clear could be way off, or clearing a collapsed tunnel may present more difficult problems than digging a new one, or both.

We don't know that he did nothing for weeks.  Presumably he just kept attacking with varying tactics, but we weren't shown two weeks of his failures, since the episode is only 20 min.  You have to remember that Drawood is 1) full of pride and delusions of superiority, and 2) an idiot who lets that pride rule his actions.  It was a blow to his ego that he was being stymied by such a small force, and that prevented him from using his troops' numbers more to his advantage at least as much as the terrain did (his ""all-out assault"" added ladders and probably other ways for more of his troops to attack at once).  So we also don't know how many of his troops were actively engaged in the all-out assault and how many were left in camp as reinforcements. But that doesn't matter, since Wein & Co. infiltrated in enemy uniforms and were perceived as part of those troops.  In fact if no troops were left in camp, it would've been more suspicious for them to show up.

All possible, but then it reduce the tactical part of the show to ""the main character win because he's up against morons"" which I never find really interesting, especially not when they constantly heap praise on the main character for... not being the moron in a room full of moron. It's like watching a race between Usain Bolt and a toddler, no fun.

In the case of the first episode it has almost skipped the part of the imperial ambasador ( in the anime it covers around 1 minute between 2 flashbacks, in the LN is a 25% of the first, a full episode).   in the case of the second is even worse, they skipped spoiler[the full negotitation with a character that is important in the future and the relation between the two factions of marden goverment]   aditionaly in the war they omited some extremely important parts spoiler[ like that all the plans of wein involve both phisical and sicological presure. in the case of the assault they omited the part that 5000 soldiers where at the back of the mountain to look out possible scape routes and the part that the ""discovery"" of the cave was responsability of wein spies so they could make the ambush.   another part that they fully omited is that untill one week after the start of the war the marden soldiers didn't use any siege weapon, and that for the next two weeks they where building them and waiting for getting some from home.   another one is the part with the fires, yes, they added it to the anime, but what they omited is that they did that multiple times and just the  day before the final assault they  burned the supplies of the marden army]   i only hope they slow down the adaptation pace and we dont have anothe seirei gensouki case ( at least with the opening we can see that they only adapted until the third LN, lets see what happens)      Back to top                  Aerodynamic41    Joined: 20 Oct 2015 		    Posts: 131       Posted: Thu Jan 20, 2022 4:40 am              Lirsen wrote:    ( at least with the opening we can see that they only adapted until the third LN, lets see what happens)            I think it's more than 3 volumes.

I've got a few different ideas for why he is trying to sell out- and none of them have general laziness as the primary motivation.

The basic idea was that Wein could use the terrain advantages to nullify the enemy numerical advantages. That's all fine, but why did the enemy general apparently do almost nothing for weeks? When he's eventually defeated he says his army is doing a full assault, why did he wait 3 weeks for this? And if the entire idea is that he can't use his full 30 000 troops to assault the mountain, where were most of his troops on the day of the assault? They can't have been assaulting the fortress since the passage are too narrow for all of them, but at the same time they weren't back in camp, did he just send them to collect flowers? Especially since, just a few days before, his camp was attacked by a small cavalry force, shouldn't he know that his camp was vulnerable to raid (how did that small force even attack his camp in the first place?).    The secret tunnel part was also pointlessly roundabout, Wein had a secret tunnel almost fully digged out but not quite finish. He then purposefully collapse another tunnel to take the enemy general mind away from the secret tunnel that general doesn't know exist? How is clearly informing your enemy that you can dig tunnel to the base of the mountain help you keep secret the fact that you can dig tunnel to the base of the mountain? Or are we suppose to think that the general is somehow so incredibly stupid that he doesn't understand that tunnel are man made and new one can therefore be made?

Ninym and Wein's relationship definitely is the most interesting part, so hopefully now that we've established Wein's skills we can get some focus on that.     Quote:     This may be something lost in adaptation but isn't Ninym actually rather busty for a woman her size? I'm not sure why she reacts so negatively to Wein's random sleep talking            She seemed rather modest based on the preceding scene imo. I think the outfit enhances her bust. At best, to me, she presented as average for her size.     meiam wrote:    Episode 1 was fine, but episode 2 felt sloppy.

He had no reason to hold back after the first few attempts failed. One would also presume he had already been trying to throw everything at them from early on as that seemed to be the height of his ""tactics"".

From what I understood the first tunnel already existed and was on the map, so the collapsed tunnel was to make them think it was closed off. He just didn't think they'd have dug a second parallel tunnel in advance. Though that begs the question of how much time they had to do that if clearing the collapsed tunnel would have taken months.

My guess is that it is because of her heritage as a Flahm.    Looking at the map (shown in one of the episodes), it's shown Natra is at the top; to the east is the massive Empire and to the south is a mountain range that goes most of the way to the southern coast (making Natra one of the few crossing points for goods to go into and out of the Empire - sorry folks, there is some statecraft/economics in the series, albeit lesser than Realist Hero). Whereas Flahm are not seen badly in Natra or the Empire the way they are seen in the Western countries is beyond racist. In one event likely to be covered in the series, spoiler[Wein is invited by a King to go hunting; and when he finds out that said King was planning on hunting some Flahm and hoped that Wein would allow him to hunt Ninym, he promptly executes him.]   Given the prevailing attitude to the Flahm and Natra's position as essentially a buffer state for the Empire in case of war, Ninym probably considers that her marrying Wein would cause Natra's standing to weaken to a point where the western countries collectively declare war on the kingdom. Hence why, despite her own clear feelings through just two episodes, she rejects Falanya's attempted matchmaking so vehemently.   As for her breasts, I remember her being self-conscious of them in volume 1. It seems to be a running joke that they get larger in the illustrations of each progressive volume?

Best laid plans of mice and men and all that.   But in their attempt to build the tunnel, the miners found a new vein of gold...  Vein, vain? why do I feel Wein should be pronounced as if it was ""Vein""?... so Wein got his money in the end and a new country for ""not"" conquering.   I'm loving this series and its very RTS video game approach to war. ""The Anime Protagonist who was too lazy to fail""; If he spent all his effort into trying to succeed he'd fail but as he's trying to fail then he'll surely succeed? I can accept it.   I was worried that the show would break the fine line between out and out success and outright failure but episode 2 illuminates the path forward: Greater successes yields greater rewards but also greater costs.   An empire built out of ""it seemed like a necessary step at the time"". Like Utawarerumono but with no Godzilla knockoffs.

When he's eventually defeated he says his army is doing a full assault, why did he wait 3 weeks for this? And if the entire idea is that he can't use his full 30 000 troops to assault the mountain, where were most of his troops on the day of the assault? They can't have been assaulting the fortress since the passage are too narrow for all of them, but at the same time they weren't back in camp, did he just send them to collect flowers? Especially since, just a few days before, his camp was attacked by a small cavalry force, shouldn't he know that his camp was vulnerable to raid (how did that small force even attack his camp in the first place?).           We don't know that he did nothing for weeks.  Presumably he just kept attacking with varying tactics, but we weren't shown two weeks of his failures, since the episode is only 20 min.  You have to remember that Drawood is 1) full of pride and delusions of superiority, and 2) an idiot who lets that pride rule his actions.  It was a blow to his ego that he was being stymied by such a small force, and that prevented him from using his troops' numbers more to his advantage at least as much as the terrain did (his ""all-out assault"" added ladders and probably other ways for more of his troops to attack at once).  So we also don't know how many of his troops were actively engaged in the all-out assault and how many were left in camp as reinforcements. But that doesn't matter, since Wein & Co. infiltrated in enemy uniforms and were perceived as part of those troops.  In fact if no troops were left in camp, it would've been more suspicious for them to show up.   As to how the camp was attacked previously, well, it was night, they weren't expecting a force of any size to attack so their security was lax, and once it began they were fooled into believing a much larger force was upon them, creating even more panic and chaos.  Plus Drawood seemed to be frozen into inaction by fear and by simply not being used to losing.   None of this is unrealistic.  Wars are lost all the time because of people not behaving with Vulcan logic as you always expect all characters to behave.  Generals can get fooled.  Egos can trump best tactics and thus lead to failure.  Show me a war where woulda, shoulda, coulda didn't come into play at one point or another for at least one side of the conflict.  You're always going to find one moron who wants to attack Russia in winter  (yeah, yeah, I know. It's a meme, don't @ me).

He just didn't think they'd have dug a second parallel tunnel in advance. Though that begs the question of how much time they had to do that if clearing the collapsed tunnel would have taken months.           I don't think Drawood thought they could either dig a new tunnel or excavate the collapsed one.  He's a military man, and likely doesn't know from mining or how efficient or not miners could be with that particular geology. Hell, it's not unreasonable to think he forgot they had actual miners on site, being so focused on the troops aspect of the siege.  So his ""months"" to clear could be way off, or clearing a collapsed tunnel may present more difficult problems than digging a new one, or both.

All possible, but then it reduce the tactical part of the show to ""the main character win because he's up against morons"" which I never find really interesting, especially not when they constantly heap praise on the main character for... not being the moron in a room full of moron. It's like watching a race between Usain Bolt and a toddler, no fun.

In the case of the first episode it has almost skipped the part of the imperial ambasador ( in the anime it covers around 1 minute between 2 flashbacks, in the LN is a 25% of the first, a full episode).   in the case of the second is even worse, they skipped spoiler[the full negotitation with a character that is important in the future and the relation between the two factions of marden goverment]   aditionaly in the war they omited some extremely important parts spoiler[ like that all the plans of wein involve both phisical and sicological presure. in the case of the assault they omited the part that 5000 soldiers where at the back of the mountain to look out possible scape routes and the part that the ""discovery"" of the cave was responsability of wein spies so they could make the ambush.   another part that they fully omited is that untill one week after the start of the war the marden soldiers didn't use any siege weapon, and that for the next two weeks they where building them and waiting for getting some from home.   another one is the part with the fires, yes, they added it to the anime, but what they omited is that they did that multiple times and just the  day before the final assault they  burned the supplies of the marden army]   i only hope they slow down the adaptation pace and we dont have anothe seirei gensouki case ( at least with the opening we can see that they only adapted until the third LN, lets see what happens)      Back to top                  Aerodynamic41    Joined: 20 Oct 2015 		    Posts: 131       Posted: Thu Jan 20, 2022 4:40 am              Lirsen wrote:    ( at least with the opening we can see that they only adapted until the third LN, lets see what happens)            I think it's more than 3 volumes.

The basic idea was that Wein could use the terrain advantages to nullify the enemy numerical advantages. That's all fine, but why did the enemy general apparently do almost nothing for weeks? When he's eventually defeated he says his army is doing a full assault, why did he wait 3 weeks for this? And if the entire idea is that he can't use his full 30 000 troops to assault the mountain, where were most of his troops on the day of the assault? They can't have been assaulting the fortress since the passage are too narrow for all of them, but at the same time they weren't back in camp, did he just send them to collect flowers? Especially since, just a few days before, his camp was attacked by a small cavalry force, shouldn't he know that his camp was vulnerable to raid (how did that small force even attack his camp in the first place?).    The secret tunnel part was also pointlessly roundabout, Wein had a secret tunnel almost fully digged out but not quite finish. He then purposefully collapse another tunnel to take the enemy general mind away from the secret tunnel that general doesn't know exist? How is clearly informing your enemy that you can dig tunnel to the base of the mountain help you keep secret the fact that you can dig tunnel to the base of the mountain? Or are we suppose to think that the general is somehow so incredibly stupid that he doesn't understand that tunnel are man made and new one can therefore be made?

Ninym and Wein's relationship definitely is the most interesting part, so hopefully now that we've established Wein's skills we can get some focus on that.     Quote:     This may be something lost in adaptation but isn't Ninym actually rather busty for a woman her size? I'm not sure why she reacts so negatively to Wein's random sleep talking            She seemed rather modest based on the preceding scene imo. I think the outfit enhances her bust. At best, to me, she presented as average for her size.     meiam wrote:    Episode 1 was fine, but episode 2 felt sloppy. The basic idea was that Wein could use the terrain advantages to nullify the enemy numerical advantages. That's all fine, but why did the enemy general apparently do almost nothing for weeks? When he's eventually defeated he says his army is doing a full assault, why did he wait 3 weeks for this? And if the entire idea is that he can't use his full 30 000 troops to assault the mountain, where were most of his troops on the day of the assault?            Agreed. It seemed like an odd line. He had no reason to hold back after the first few attempts failed. One would also presume he had already been trying to throw everything at them from early on as that seemed to be the height of his ""tactics"".     Quote:      The secret tunnel part was also pointlessly roundabout, Wein had a secret tunnel almost fully digged out but not quite finish. He then purposefully collapse another tunnel to take the enemy general mind away from the secret tunnel that general doesn't know exist?

From what I understood the first tunnel already existed and was on the map, so the collapsed tunnel was to make them think it was closed off. He just didn't think they'd have dug a second parallel tunnel in advance. Though that begs the question of how much time they had to do that if clearing the collapsed tunnel would have taken months.

Apparently the anime's reduced her chest size compared to the Light Novel illustrations (although apparently they got bigger as the series went on).

My guess is that it is because of her heritage as a Flahm.    Looking at the map (shown in one of the episodes), it's shown Natra is at the top; to the east is the massive Empire and to the south is a mountain range that goes most of the way to the southern coast (making Natra one of the few crossing points for goods to go into and out of the Empire - sorry folks, there is some statecraft/economics in the series, albeit lesser than Realist Hero). Whereas Flahm are not seen badly in Natra or the Empire the way they are seen in the Western countries is beyond racist. In one event likely to be covered in the series, spoiler[Wein is invited by a King to go hunting; and when he finds out that said King was planning on hunting some Flahm and hoped that Wein would allow him to hunt Ninym, he promptly executes him.]   Given the prevailing attitude to the Flahm and Natra's position as essentially a buffer state for the Empire in case of war, Ninym probably considers that her marrying Wein would cause Natra's standing to weaken to a point where the western countries collectively declare war on the kingdom. Hence why, despite her own clear feelings through just two episodes, she rejects Falanya's attempted matchmaking so vehemently.   As for her breasts, I remember her being self-conscious of them in volume 1. It seems to be a running joke that they get larger in the illustrations of each progressive volume?

Best laid plans of mice and men and all that.   But in their attempt to build the tunnel, the miners found a new vein of gold...  Vein, vain? why do I feel Wein should be pronounced as if it was ""Vein""?... so Wein got his money in the end and a new country for ""not"" conquering.   I'm loving this series and its very RTS video game approach to war. ""The Anime Protagonist who was too lazy to fail""; If he spent all his effort into trying to succeed he'd fail but as he's trying to fail then he'll surely succeed? I can accept it.   I was worried that the show would break the fine line between out and out success and outright failure but episode 2 illuminates the path forward: Greater successes yields greater rewards but also greater costs.   An empire built out of ""it seemed like a necessary step at the time"". Like Utawarerumono but with no Godzilla knockoffs.

And if the entire idea is that he can't use his full 30 000 troops to assault the mountain, where were most of his troops on the day of the assault? They can't have been assaulting the fortress since the passage are too narrow for all of them, but at the same time they weren't back in camp, did he just send them to collect flowers? Especially since, just a few days before, his camp was attacked by a small cavalry force, shouldn't he know that his camp was vulnerable to raid (how did that small force even attack his camp in the first place?).           We don't know that he did nothing for weeks.  Presumably he just kept attacking with varying tactics, but we weren't shown two weeks of his failures, since the episode is only 20 min.  You have to remember that Drawood is 1) full of pride and delusions of superiority, and 2) an idiot who lets that pride rule his actions.  It was a blow to his ego that he was being stymied by such a small force, and that prevented him from using his troops' numbers more to his advantage at least as much as the terrain did (his ""all-out assault"" added ladders and probably other ways for more of his troops to attack at once).  So we also don't know how many of his troops were actively engaged in the all-out assault and how many were left in camp as reinforcements. But that doesn't matter, since Wein & Co. infiltrated in enemy uniforms and were perceived as part of those troops.  In fact if no troops were left in camp, it would've been more suspicious for them to show up.   As to how the camp was attacked previously, well, it was night, they weren't expecting a force of any size to attack so their security was lax, and once it began they were fooled into believing a much larger force was upon them, creating even more panic and chaos.  Plus Drawood seemed to be frozen into inaction by fear and by simply not being used to losing.   None of this is unrealistic.  Wars are lost all the time because of people not behaving with Vulcan logic as you always expect all characters to behave.  Generals can get fooled.  Egos can trump best tactics and thus lead to failure.  Show me a war where woulda, shoulda, coulda didn't come into play at one point or another for at least one side of the conflict.  You're always going to find one moron who wants to attack Russia in winter  (yeah, yeah, I know. It's a meme, don't @ me).

I don't think Drawood thought they could either dig a new tunnel or excavate the collapsed one.  He's a military man, and likely doesn't know from mining or how efficient or not miners could be with that particular geology. Hell, it's not unreasonable to think he forgot they had actual miners on site, being so focused on the troops aspect of the siege.  So his ""months"" to clear could be way off, or clearing a collapsed tunnel may present more difficult problems than digging a new one, or both.

All possible, but then it reduce the tactical part of the show to ""the main character win because he's up against morons"" which I never find really interesting, especially not when they constantly heap praise on the main character for... not being the moron in a room full of moron. It's like watching a race between Usain Bolt and a toddler, no fun.

In the case of the first episode it has almost skipped the part of the imperial ambasador ( in the anime it covers around 1 minute between 2 flashbacks, in the LN is a 25% of the first, a full episode).   in the case of the second is even worse, they skipped spoiler[the full negotitation with a character that is important in the future and the relation between the two factions of marden goverment]   aditionaly in the war they omited some extremely important parts spoiler[ like that all the plans of wein involve both phisical and sicological presure. in the case of the assault they omited the part that 5000 soldiers where at the back of the mountain to look out possible scape routes and the part that the ""discovery"" of the cave was responsability of wein spies so they could make the ambush.   another part that they fully omited is that untill one week after the start of the war the marden soldiers didn't use any siege weapon, and that for the next two weeks they where building them and waiting for getting some from home.   another one is the part with the fires, yes, they added it to the anime, but what they omited is that they did that multiple times and just the  day before the final assault they  burned the supplies of the marden army]   i only hope they slow down the adaptation pace and we dont have anothe seirei gensouki case ( at least with the opening we can see that they only adapted until the third LN, lets see what happens)      Back to top                  Aerodynamic41    Joined: 20 Oct 2015 		    Posts: 131       Posted: Thu Jan 20, 2022 4:40 am              Lirsen wrote:    ( at least with the opening we can see that they only adapted until the third LN, lets see what happens)            I think it's more than 3 volumes.
