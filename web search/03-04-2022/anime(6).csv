GN 1                      Synopsis:             Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?      Review:         Synopsis:        Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?     Review:            It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise. When a story about a blossoming romance between two characters starts with one of them very directly taking advantage of the other, it has to do a lot of legwork to dig itself out of that hole. Handle that poorly and readers may be left wondering why they should root for these characters by the second chapter. While I don't think that all of the legwork was achieved in this first volume, I was nevertheless surprised at just how subtle yet involved the series is in raising some rather realistic questions about non-heteronormative sexual orientations and how society views them.    A lot of this doesn't come from our main character Chiyo (though there is some bicuriosity starting to bloom there) but rather from the landlord that is placing her in this situation. Despite being younger, there is a clear power imbalance between the two characters and the manga very much treads the line of making sure that the situation doesn't come across as too malicious. A lot of the “favors” being requested range from the mundane to the surprisingly wholesome, and you do get a strong feeling that the landlord isn't going into this arrangement with sex as the primary goal. The manga goes out of its way to highlight that Chiyo's landlord is simply feeling very lonely and a lot of this is borne out of her desperation to fill the void. It is honestly rather refreshing to have a female character that is so blunt about only being into women, but what I found just as fascinating was the occasional snide comment about other sexualities and how people view her.    The manga does not spell out everything for the reader which I appreciate. You get the sense that this was written for an audience that is willing to look past the uncomfortable premise to see where the story actually goes, and what you'll discover beneath that facade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society where their attractions are frowned upon, as well as what it's like to live through a world of microaggressions from people that probably didn't mean to be hurtful but still end up accomplishing just that. That said, I personally think that there are certain lines that should never be crossed regardless of circumstance, and this landlord crossed at least two of them throughout this first volume alone. But surprisingly, I didn't walk away thinking that she was a terrible person, but rather a lonely and misguided soul, which is an accomplishment given my trepidations about the material. If anything, I am interested in seeing where this story goes and if it can pull off the difficult task of having me fully buy into this developing relationship.    However, while I appreciate how the landlord's character is written as she is far and away the most interesting thing about this manga, I can't say the same about our actual named protagonist. She is very much the typical wide-eyed screw-up manga lead that is comedically incapable of taking care of herself despite being the oldest of the two. She definitely means well, and she is willing to step outside her comfort zone for the sake of making up for her own shortcomings, which is endearing. However, the jokes about her incompetence could get a little tiring towards the end. There's nothing necessarily wrong with her character; it's just that this first volume was a little lopsided in its characterization – the bulk of that very subtle character-building went to the landlord whereas Chiyo is clearly meant to counterbalance that as a source of levity. Still, I think that levity could have had more variety towards the end. There are hints towards the end that imply something deeper is beginning to develop – and I hope that goes somewhere – but aside from that, there's just not a lot to Chiyo in this first volume.    Repressed sexuality and sexual desire, non-heterosexual curiosity, societal commentary on different types of sexual orientation – I must admit, none of these are things I was expecting this manga to really touch upon when I originally picked it up to review. While it's impossible to resolve such heavy issues within a single 188-page volume, the fact that there is a clear setup for the story to explore them more deeply made me look at the volume in a more favorable light than I initially had. It is uncomfortable and as I alluded to before, ethical lines like consent or subtle manipulation are muddied more than I think the story really needed to. Unlike the larger societal issues, these more interpersonal dynamics are not treated with the seriousness they deserve, being accompanied by an overall lighter, almost comedic tone. Sometimes it's a nice blend, but mostly they feel incongruous with the at times cartoonish sense of humor the manga has.    This could also be a stylistic issue as the manga will occasionally use simplified character expressions for the sake of brevity. Things like Chiyo's rounded, airheaded expressions are nice and it's not like the art tries too hard to be cute or funny. However, similar to Chiyo's characterization, these don't have a lot of variety to them. That's not true for the whole manga as there are plenty of other instances where the paneling and character framing are being used in subtle ways to elevate the heavier moments. But whenever the style shifts away from that, it can sometimes get jarring and even disappointing to see engaging artwork being undercut by something more typical and repetitive. I hope the balance is improved in future columes.    All in all I Can't Believe I Slept With You! left me pleasantly surprised. It could be because my expectations weren't exactly positive going in, but I do think there are some genuine attempts at leveraging that initial discomfort to talk about some pretty relevant stuff. The mileage on whether or not those conversation starters are worth the shiftier implications of some of our characters' actions will vary from person to person. For me personally though, I think it's a step in the right direction and while I'm not sure if the story will fully redeem itself from the place where it starts, there is enough competency and thoughtfulness on display here that at the very least makes me believe there's a chance that might happen. Guess the manga is forcing me to check out the other volumes to see if my assumptions were right.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B  + A morally questionable lead that's able to generate a surprising amount of sympathy, subtle yet relevant social commentary on sexuality and loneliness − Not much to Chiyo's character for most of the book, humor lacks variety and can clash with more serious moments            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Miyako Miyahara   Full encyclopedia details aboutI Can't Believe I Slept With You!

GN 1                      Synopsis:             Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?      Review:         Synopsis:        Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?     Review:            It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise. When a story about a blossoming romance between two characters starts with one of them very directly taking advantage of the other, it has to do a lot of legwork to dig itself out of that hole. Handle that poorly and readers may be left wondering why they should root for these characters by the second chapter. While I don't think that all of the legwork was achieved in this first volume, I was nevertheless surprised at just how subtle yet involved the series is in raising some rather realistic questions about non-heteronormative sexual orientations and how society views them.    A lot of this doesn't come from our main character Chiyo (though there is some bicuriosity starting to bloom there) but rather from the landlord that is placing her in this situation. Despite being younger, there is a clear power imbalance between the two characters and the manga very much treads the line of making sure that the situation doesn't come across as too malicious. A lot of the “favors” being requested range from the mundane to the surprisingly wholesome, and you do get a strong feeling that the landlord isn't going into this arrangement with sex as the primary goal. The manga goes out of its way to highlight that Chiyo's landlord is simply feeling very lonely and a lot of this is borne out of her desperation to fill the void. It is honestly rather refreshing to have a female character that is so blunt about only being into women, but what I found just as fascinating was the occasional snide comment about other sexualities and how people view her.    The manga does not spell out everything for the reader which I appreciate. You get the sense that this was written for an audience that is willing to look past the uncomfortable premise to see where the story actually goes, and what you'll discover beneath that facade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society where their attractions are frowned upon, as well as what it's like to live through a world of microaggressions from people that probably didn't mean to be hurtful but still end up accomplishing just that. That said, I personally think that there are certain lines that should never be crossed regardless of circumstance, and this landlord crossed at least two of them throughout this first volume alone. But surprisingly, I didn't walk away thinking that she was a terrible person, but rather a lonely and misguided soul, which is an accomplishment given my trepidations about the material. If anything, I am interested in seeing where this story goes and if it can pull off the difficult task of having me fully buy into this developing relationship.    However, while I appreciate how the landlord's character is written as she is far and away the most interesting thing about this manga, I can't say the same about our actual named protagonist. She is very much the typical wide-eyed screw-up manga lead that is comedically incapable of taking care of herself despite being the oldest of the two. She definitely means well, and she is willing to step outside her comfort zone for the sake of making up for her own shortcomings, which is endearing. However, the jokes about her incompetence could get a little tiring towards the end. There's nothing necessarily wrong with her character; it's just that this first volume was a little lopsided in its characterization – the bulk of that very subtle character-building went to the landlord whereas Chiyo is clearly meant to counterbalance that as a source of levity. Still, I think that levity could have had more variety towards the end. There are hints towards the end that imply something deeper is beginning to develop – and I hope that goes somewhere – but aside from that, there's just not a lot to Chiyo in this first volume.    Repressed sexuality and sexual desire, non-heterosexual curiosity, societal commentary on different types of sexual orientation – I must admit, none of these are things I was expecting this manga to really touch upon when I originally picked it up to review. While it's impossible to resolve such heavy issues within a single 188-page volume, the fact that there is a clear setup for the story to explore them more deeply made me look at the volume in a more favorable light than I initially had. It is uncomfortable and as I alluded to before, ethical lines like consent or subtle manipulation are muddied more than I think the story really needed to. Unlike the larger societal issues, these more interpersonal dynamics are not treated with the seriousness they deserve, being accompanied by an overall lighter, almost comedic tone. Sometimes it's a nice blend, but mostly they feel incongruous with the at times cartoonish sense of humor the manga has.    This could also be a stylistic issue as the manga will occasionally use simplified character expressions for the sake of brevity. Things like Chiyo's rounded, airheaded expressions are nice and it's not like the art tries too hard to be cute or funny. However, similar to Chiyo's characterization, these don't have a lot of variety to them. That's not true for the whole manga as there are plenty of other instances where the paneling and character framing are being used in subtle ways to elevate the heavier moments. But whenever the style shifts away from that, it can sometimes get jarring and even disappointing to see engaging artwork being undercut by something more typical and repetitive. I hope the balance is improved in future columes.    All in all I Can't Believe I Slept With You! left me pleasantly surprised. It could be because my expectations weren't exactly positive going in, but I do think there are some genuine attempts at leveraging that initial discomfort to talk about some pretty relevant stuff. The mileage on whether or not those conversation starters are worth the shiftier implications of some of our characters' actions will vary from person to person. For me personally though, I think it's a step in the right direction and while I'm not sure if the story will fully redeem itself from the place where it starts, there is enough competency and thoughtfulness on display here that at the very least makes me believe there's a chance that might happen. Guess the manga is forcing me to check out the other volumes to see if my assumptions were right.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B  + A morally questionable lead that's able to generate a surprising amount of sympathy, subtle yet relevant social commentary on sexuality and loneliness − Not much to Chiyo's character for most of the book, humor lacks variety and can clash with more serious moments            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Miyako Miyahara   Full encyclopedia details aboutI Can't Believe I Slept With You!

GN 1                      Synopsis:             Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?      Review:         Synopsis:        Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?     Review:            It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise. When a story about a blossoming romance between two characters starts with one of them very directly taking advantage of the other, it has to do a lot of legwork to dig itself out of that hole. Handle that poorly and readers may be left wondering why they should root for these characters by the second chapter. While I don't think that all of the legwork was achieved in this first volume, I was nevertheless surprised at just how subtle yet involved the series is in raising some rather realistic questions about non-heteronormative sexual orientations and how society views them.    A lot of this doesn't come from our main character Chiyo (though there is some bicuriosity starting to bloom there) but rather from the landlord that is placing her in this situation. Despite being younger, there is a clear power imbalance between the two characters and the manga very much treads the line of making sure that the situation doesn't come across as too malicious. A lot of the “favors” being requested range from the mundane to the surprisingly wholesome, and you do get a strong feeling that the landlord isn't going into this arrangement with sex as the primary goal. The manga goes out of its way to highlight that Chiyo's landlord is simply feeling very lonely and a lot of this is borne out of her desperation to fill the void. It is honestly rather refreshing to have a female character that is so blunt about only being into women, but what I found just as fascinating was the occasional snide comment about other sexualities and how people view her.    The manga does not spell out everything for the reader which I appreciate. You get the sense that this was written for an audience that is willing to look past the uncomfortable premise to see where the story actually goes, and what you'll discover beneath that facade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society where their attractions are frowned upon, as well as what it's like to live through a world of microaggressions from people that probably didn't mean to be hurtful but still end up accomplishing just that. That said, I personally think that there are certain lines that should never be crossed regardless of circumstance, and this landlord crossed at least two of them throughout this first volume alone. But surprisingly, I didn't walk away thinking that she was a terrible person, but rather a lonely and misguided soul, which is an accomplishment given my trepidations about the material. If anything, I am interested in seeing where this story goes and if it can pull off the difficult task of having me fully buy into this developing relationship.    However, while I appreciate how the landlord's character is written as she is far and away the most interesting thing about this manga, I can't say the same about our actual named protagonist. She is very much the typical wide-eyed screw-up manga lead that is comedically incapable of taking care of herself despite being the oldest of the two. She definitely means well, and she is willing to step outside her comfort zone for the sake of making up for her own shortcomings, which is endearing. However, the jokes about her incompetence could get a little tiring towards the end. There's nothing necessarily wrong with her character; it's just that this first volume was a little lopsided in its characterization – the bulk of that very subtle character-building went to the landlord whereas Chiyo is clearly meant to counterbalance that as a source of levity. Still, I think that levity could have had more variety towards the end. There are hints towards the end that imply something deeper is beginning to develop – and I hope that goes somewhere – but aside from that, there's just not a lot to Chiyo in this first volume.    Repressed sexuality and sexual desire, non-heterosexual curiosity, societal commentary on different types of sexual orientation – I must admit, none of these are things I was expecting this manga to really touch upon when I originally picked it up to review. While it's impossible to resolve such heavy issues within a single 188-page volume, the fact that there is a clear setup for the story to explore them more deeply made me look at the volume in a more favorable light than I initially had. It is uncomfortable and as I alluded to before, ethical lines like consent or subtle manipulation are muddied more than I think the story really needed to. Unlike the larger societal issues, these more interpersonal dynamics are not treated with the seriousness they deserve, being accompanied by an overall lighter, almost comedic tone. Sometimes it's a nice blend, but mostly they feel incongruous with the at times cartoonish sense of humor the manga has.    This could also be a stylistic issue as the manga will occasionally use simplified character expressions for the sake of brevity. Things like Chiyo's rounded, airheaded expressions are nice and it's not like the art tries too hard to be cute or funny. However, similar to Chiyo's characterization, these don't have a lot of variety to them. That's not true for the whole manga as there are plenty of other instances where the paneling and character framing are being used in subtle ways to elevate the heavier moments. But whenever the style shifts away from that, it can sometimes get jarring and even disappointing to see engaging artwork being undercut by something more typical and repetitive. I hope the balance is improved in future columes.    All in all I Can't Believe I Slept With You! left me pleasantly surprised. It could be because my expectations weren't exactly positive going in, but I do think there are some genuine attempts at leveraging that initial discomfort to talk about some pretty relevant stuff. The mileage on whether or not those conversation starters are worth the shiftier implications of some of our characters' actions will vary from person to person. For me personally though, I think it's a step in the right direction and while I'm not sure if the story will fully redeem itself from the place where it starts, there is enough competency and thoughtfulness on display here that at the very least makes me believe there's a chance that might happen. Guess the manga is forcing me to check out the other volumes to see if my assumptions were right.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B  + A morally questionable lead that's able to generate a surprising amount of sympathy, subtle yet relevant social commentary on sexuality and loneliness − Not much to Chiyo's character for most of the book, humor lacks variety and can clash with more serious moments            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Miyako Miyahara   Full encyclopedia details aboutI Can't Believe I Slept With You!

GN 1                      Synopsis:             Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?      Review:         Synopsis:        Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?     Review:            It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise. When a story about a blossoming romance between two characters starts with one of them very directly taking advantage of the other, it has to do a lot of legwork to dig itself out of that hole. Handle that poorly and readers may be left wondering why they should root for these characters by the second chapter. While I don't think that all of the legwork was achieved in this first volume, I was nevertheless surprised at just how subtle yet involved the series is in raising some rather realistic questions about non-heteronormative sexual orientations and how society views them.    A lot of this doesn't come from our main character Chiyo (though there is some bicuriosity starting to bloom there) but rather from the landlord that is placing her in this situation. Despite being younger, there is a clear power imbalance between the two characters and the manga very much treads the line of making sure that the situation doesn't come across as too malicious. A lot of the “favors” being requested range from the mundane to the surprisingly wholesome, and you do get a strong feeling that the landlord isn't going into this arrangement with sex as the primary goal. The manga goes out of its way to highlight that Chiyo's landlord is simply feeling very lonely and a lot of this is borne out of her desperation to fill the void. It is honestly rather refreshing to have a female character that is so blunt about only being into women, but what I found just as fascinating was the occasional snide comment about other sexualities and how people view her.    The manga does not spell out everything for the reader which I appreciate. You get the sense that this was written for an audience that is willing to look past the uncomfortable premise to see where the story actually goes, and what you'll discover beneath that facade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society where their attractions are frowned upon, as well as what it's like to live through a world of microaggressions from people that probably didn't mean to be hurtful but still end up accomplishing just that. That said, I personally think that there are certain lines that should never be crossed regardless of circumstance, and this landlord crossed at least two of them throughout this first volume alone. But surprisingly, I didn't walk away thinking that she was a terrible person, but rather a lonely and misguided soul, which is an accomplishment given my trepidations about the material. If anything, I am interested in seeing where this story goes and if it can pull off the difficult task of having me fully buy into this developing relationship.    However, while I appreciate how the landlord's character is written as she is far and away the most interesting thing about this manga, I can't say the same about our actual named protagonist. She is very much the typical wide-eyed screw-up manga lead that is comedically incapable of taking care of herself despite being the oldest of the two. She definitely means well, and she is willing to step outside her comfort zone for the sake of making up for her own shortcomings, which is endearing. However, the jokes about her incompetence could get a little tiring towards the end. There's nothing necessarily wrong with her character; it's just that this first volume was a little lopsided in its characterization – the bulk of that very subtle character-building went to the landlord whereas Chiyo is clearly meant to counterbalance that as a source of levity. Still, I think that levity could have had more variety towards the end. There are hints towards the end that imply something deeper is beginning to develop – and I hope that goes somewhere – but aside from that, there's just not a lot to Chiyo in this first volume.    Repressed sexuality and sexual desire, non-heterosexual curiosity, societal commentary on different types of sexual orientation – I must admit, none of these are things I was expecting this manga to really touch upon when I originally picked it up to review. While it's impossible to resolve such heavy issues within a single 188-page volume, the fact that there is a clear setup for the story to explore them more deeply made me look at the volume in a more favorable light than I initially had. It is uncomfortable and as I alluded to before, ethical lines like consent or subtle manipulation are muddied more than I think the story really needed to. Unlike the larger societal issues, these more interpersonal dynamics are not treated with the seriousness they deserve, being accompanied by an overall lighter, almost comedic tone. Sometimes it's a nice blend, but mostly they feel incongruous with the at times cartoonish sense of humor the manga has.    This could also be a stylistic issue as the manga will occasionally use simplified character expressions for the sake of brevity. Things like Chiyo's rounded, airheaded expressions are nice and it's not like the art tries too hard to be cute or funny. However, similar to Chiyo's characterization, these don't have a lot of variety to them. That's not true for the whole manga as there are plenty of other instances where the paneling and character framing are being used in subtle ways to elevate the heavier moments. But whenever the style shifts away from that, it can sometimes get jarring and even disappointing to see engaging artwork being undercut by something more typical and repetitive. I hope the balance is improved in future columes.    All in all I Can't Believe I Slept With You! left me pleasantly surprised. It could be because my expectations weren't exactly positive going in, but I do think there are some genuine attempts at leveraging that initial discomfort to talk about some pretty relevant stuff. The mileage on whether or not those conversation starters are worth the shiftier implications of some of our characters' actions will vary from person to person. For me personally though, I think it's a step in the right direction and while I'm not sure if the story will fully redeem itself from the place where it starts, there is enough competency and thoughtfulness on display here that at the very least makes me believe there's a chance that might happen. Guess the manga is forcing me to check out the other volumes to see if my assumptions were right.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B  + A morally questionable lead that's able to generate a surprising amount of sympathy, subtle yet relevant social commentary on sexuality and loneliness − Not much to Chiyo's character for most of the book, humor lacks variety and can clash with more serious moments            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Miyako Miyahara   Full encyclopedia details aboutI Can't Believe I Slept With You!

News Love All Play Badminton Anime Casts Kishō Taniyama, Hiroki Takahashi   posted on 2022-04-02 17:39 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Taniyama, Takahashi play team's superstar doubles partners    The official website for the television anime of Asami Koseki's Love All Play badminton novel revealed two more cast members on Saturday. The newly announced cast members voice the star players in the protagonist Ryō Mizushima's badminton team. These two characters debut in the anime's second episode on April 9:    Kishō Taniyama as Kento Yusa, the strongest superstar player of his generation, but he has an egotistical side   Hiroki Takahashi as Yūsuke Yokokawa, Yusa's doubles partner, whom the younger players consider a big-brother figure they can count on for advice     The anime premiered on April 2. The anime will air on YTV, NTV, and their affiliates on Saturdays at 5:30 p.m.    The main cast includes:    Natsuki Hanae as Ryō Mizushima   Yōhei Azakami as Shōhei Sakaki   Makoto Furukawa as Kо̄ki Matsuda   Kensho Ono as Taichi Higashiyama   Tetsuya Kakihara as Yо̄ji Higashiyama   Yuuki Kaji as Akira Uchida   Minako Kotobuki as Rika Mizushima   Kazuya Nakai as Hitoshi Ebihara   Masaya Matsukaze as Shizuo Nakano   Shimba Tsuchiya as Hirohito Monda    Additionally, real-life badminton players Yūta Watanabe and Arisa Higashino will appear in the anime playing themselves.    The story follows Ryō Mizushima, who joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and is surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Hiroshi Takeuchi (Peacemaker Kurogane: Belief storyboarder, Blade & Soul, Zunda Horizon) is directing the anime at Nippon Animation and OLM. Tomoko Konparu (Uta no Prince-sama - Maji Love 1000%, Nodame Cantabile) is supervising the series scripts and writing them with Miharu Hirami (Kodocha, The New Adventures of Kimba The White Lion), Shingo Irie (All Out!!, Kuroko's Basketball), and Michiko Yokote (Cute High Earth Defense Club LOVE!, Genshiken, Shirobako). Riko Kaneda is designing the characters, and Yuki Hayashi (My Hero Academia, Welcome to the Ballroom, Shaman King) is composing the music.    Sporting goods maker YONEX is supervising and collaborating on the designs for the anime. YONEX assisted on a previous badminton anime, Hanebad! from 2018.    Poplar's Pureful imprint published the first Love All Play novel in May 2011, and Koseki has since written three more follow-up novels. The anime is also getting a manga adaptation by Dam Miyata on Shueisha's Tonari no Young Jump website.

The newly announced cast members voice the star players in the protagonist Ryō Mizushima's badminton team. These two characters debut in the anime's second episode on April 9:    Kishō Taniyama as Kento Yusa, the strongest superstar player of his generation, but he has an egotistical side   Hiroki Takahashi as Yūsuke Yokokawa, Yusa's doubles partner, whom the younger players consider a big-brother figure they can count on for advice     The anime premiered on April 2. The anime will air on YTV, NTV, and their affiliates on Saturdays at 5:30 p.m.    The main cast includes:    Natsuki Hanae as Ryō Mizushima   Yōhei Azakami as Shōhei Sakaki   Makoto Furukawa as Kо̄ki Matsuda   Kensho Ono as Taichi Higashiyama   Tetsuya Kakihara as Yо̄ji Higashiyama   Yuuki Kaji as Akira Uchida   Minako Kotobuki as Rika Mizushima   Kazuya Nakai as Hitoshi Ebihara   Masaya Matsukaze as Shizuo Nakano   Shimba Tsuchiya as Hirohito Monda    Additionally, real-life badminton players Yūta Watanabe and Arisa Higashino will appear in the anime playing themselves.    The story follows Ryō Mizushima, who joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and is surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Hiroshi Takeuchi (Peacemaker Kurogane: Belief storyboarder, Blade & Soul, Zunda Horizon) is directing the anime at Nippon Animation and OLM. Tomoko Konparu (Uta no Prince-sama - Maji Love 1000%, Nodame Cantabile) is supervising the series scripts and writing them with Miharu Hirami (Kodocha, The New Adventures of Kimba The White Lion), Shingo Irie (All Out!!, Kuroko's Basketball), and Michiko Yokote (Cute High Earth Defense Club LOVE!, Genshiken, Shirobako). Riko Kaneda is designing the characters, and Yuki Hayashi (My Hero Academia, Welcome to the Ballroom, Shaman King) is composing the music.    Sporting goods maker YONEX is supervising and collaborating on the designs for the anime. YONEX assisted on a previous badminton anime, Hanebad! from 2018.    Poplar's Pureful imprint published the first Love All Play novel in May 2011, and Koseki has since written three more follow-up novels. The anime is also getting a manga adaptation by Dam Miyata on Shueisha's Tonari no Young Jump website.

With this, the April Fool's joke is even funnier haha.   I honestly don't remember much about it. I remember liking Yoshino (and being voiced by Inori Minase) and a commando girl. Ah, there was also a rather feminine guy... and a fat guy in the last arc.   Anyway, it's interesting how series we thought were forgotten are making a comeback.

With this, the April Fool's joke is even funnier haha.   I honestly don't remember much about it. I remember liking Yoshino (and being voiced by Inori Minase) and a commando girl. Ah, there was also a rather feminine guy... and a fat guy in the last arc.   Anyway, it's interesting how series we thought were forgotten are making a comeback.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Executioner and Her Way of Life   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (37 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Executioner and Her Way of Life   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (37 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Executioner and Her Way of Life   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (37 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Executioner and Her Way of Life   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (37 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Executioner and Her Way of Life   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (37 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (37 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.

It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (37 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.

Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (37 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.

It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.  ",positive,en,{}

Maaya Sakamoto to Release Double A-Side Single “Sumire / Kotoba ni Dekinai” on May 25   Apr  2nd 2022         Today, on Maaya Sakamoto's birthday, she announced that she will be releasing a double A-side single containing the theme songs of two anime starting in April in Japan.  The first is the opening theme for Deaimon, a story set in an old confectionery store in Kyoto. The title is “Sumire.” The lyrics were written by Sakamoto herself, with composition and arrangement by Shigeru Kishida of Kururi, a Japanese rock band from Kyoto, matching the setting of the anime.  The second song is “Kotoba ni Dekinai,” the ED theme for the third season of the popular anime Ascendance of a Bookworm, which has sold over 6 million copies (including e-books). Maaya Sakamoto wrote and composed this song herself. The coupling track will be a Studio Live version of “Senri no Michi,” a song created to commemorate the 1,000th broadcast of Vitamin M, a radio program hosted by Maaya Sakamoto.  The limited first edition will come with a bonus Blu-ray containing the final day of Maaya Sakamoto's Acoustic Live & Talk 2020 tour, which was held on November 29, 2020, at Zepp Tokyo.  In addition, two cover photos (limited first edition and regular edition) and a music video (short ver.) for “Sumire” have been released. The music video features Kento Ohgiya, who co-arranged and played the piano for Sumire.

Maaya Sakamoto to Release Double A-Side Single “Sumire / Kotoba ni Dekinai” on May 25   Apr  2nd 2022         Today, on Maaya Sakamoto's birthday, she announced that she will be releasing a double A-side single containing the theme songs of two anime starting in April in Japan.  The first is the opening theme for Deaimon, a story set in an old confectionery store in Kyoto. The title is “Sumire.” The lyrics were written by Sakamoto herself, with composition and arrangement by Shigeru Kishida of Kururi, a Japanese rock band from Kyoto, matching the setting of the anime.  The second song is “Kotoba ni Dekinai,” the ED theme for the third season of the popular anime Ascendance of a Bookworm, which has sold over 6 million copies (including e-books). Maaya Sakamoto wrote and composed this song herself. The coupling track will be a Studio Live version of “Senri no Michi,” a song created to commemorate the 1,000th broadcast of Vitamin M, a radio program hosted by Maaya Sakamoto.  The limited first edition will come with a bonus Blu-ray containing the final day of Maaya Sakamoto's Acoustic Live & Talk 2020 tour, which was held on November 29, 2020, at Zepp Tokyo.  In addition, two cover photos (limited first edition and regular edition) and a music video (short ver.) for “Sumire” have been released. The music video features Kento Ohgiya, who co-arranged and played the piano for Sumire.

Maaya Sakamoto to Release Double A-Side Single “Sumire / Kotoba ni Dekinai” on May 25   Apr  2nd 2022         Today, on Maaya Sakamoto's birthday, she announced that she will be releasing a double A-side single containing the theme songs of two anime starting in April in Japan.  The first is the opening theme for Deaimon, a story set in an old confectionery store in Kyoto. The title is “Sumire.” The lyrics were written by Sakamoto herself, with composition and arrangement by Shigeru Kishida of Kururi, a Japanese rock band from Kyoto, matching the setting of the anime.  The second song is “Kotoba ni Dekinai,” the ED theme for the third season of the popular anime Ascendance of a Bookworm, which has sold over 6 million copies (including e-books). Maaya Sakamoto wrote and composed this song herself. The coupling track will be a Studio Live version of “Senri no Michi,” a song created to commemorate the 1,000th broadcast of Vitamin M, a radio program hosted by Maaya Sakamoto.  The limited first edition will come with a bonus Blu-ray containing the final day of Maaya Sakamoto's Acoustic Live & Talk 2020 tour, which was held on November 29, 2020, at Zepp Tokyo.  In addition, two cover photos (limited first edition and regular edition) and a music video (short ver.) for “Sumire” have been released. The music video features Kento Ohgiya, who co-arranged and played the piano for Sumire.

How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami   by Kennedy, Apr  1st 2022          By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (5 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami   by Kennedy, Apr  1st 2022          By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (5 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami   by Kennedy, Apr  1st 2022          By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (5 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami   by Kennedy, Apr  1st 2022          By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (5 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami   by Kennedy, Apr  1st 2022          By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (5 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami   by Kennedy, Apr  1st 2022          By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned.

It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (5 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,{}

The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have.

The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (5 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}
03-04-2022,anime,29,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2022-04-01/how-an-april-fools-day-joke-revived-toonami/.184015,How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami - Anime News Network:SEA,"        By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate.

Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (5 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives   ",positive,en,{}

The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did.

Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show.

The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).

Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began.

While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.   ",positive,en,{}

The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools.

How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke?

How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022       Lightning and Romance GN 1-2                     Synopsis:             Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?      Review:         Synopsis:        Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?     Review:            If you've been reading Rin Mikimoto's previously translated works, you may have figured out that she has a thing for the age-gap romance – all of her other translated works but Kira-kun Today fall under that heading. This time she's trying something new in the field: rather than having her heroine fall in love with a teacher (Love's Reach) or a famous, slightly older celebrity (Kiss Me at the Stroke of Midnight), the older man Sumire falls for is in her high school class, and unlike titles like A Girl and Her Guard Dog, he appears to be there strictly to learn.    There's absolutely nothing wrong with going back at a nontraditional age to finish your education, so although it's odd, it's not bad that 20-year-old Reo is sitting in a second-year high school classroom even if in real life we more often see this play out at the university level. While people are confused about Reo's presence, no one really makes any disparaging remarks about it, possibly because they're all three-quarters convinced that he's some sort of evil yakuza delinquent, a belief that the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his cheek only reinforces. Reo doesn't necessarily seem to mind that his classmates are largely afraid of him, possibly because he's very much aware that he's an adult in a room full of children, and while we don't get any real answers about why he's completing high school now, the very fact that he is doing so seems to be more important, and that, if we extrapolate from volume two, it's borne out of a desire to make up for some misspent youth.    That he also is much more fervent in his attempts to fend Sumire off than some of Mikimoto's other heroes is a bit of a saving grace as well. He knows that this is maybe not an awesome relationship to be embarking on. He does his level best to drive Sumire away, putting on a very good show in volume one of being disinterested, one which begins to crumble a bit in volume two. This is at least in part because Sumire comes from the Chutzpah School of Romance Heroines, and she's not about to let him dictate her feelings – especially not when he's kind of bad at hiding that he may like her, too (which begins to creep out in the first book and becomes solidified in the second). Despite the reciprocal nature of their feelings, however, he remains unrelenting in his commitment to not date Sumire. While we can all make a good guess that this really isn't going to last, the “we can't” approach is a nice change from the “no, really, I swear I don't like you” tactic that I feel like we see more of in the genre. That he seems to have some very good reasons beyond simply being older than her is an intriguing bit of story-building, and while it may turn out to be reasons that only Reo thinks are important, just being able to stick to his guns around the very open Sumire does a nice job of illustrating to the reader that he really is an adult to her teenager.    That Reo's family is somehow involved in all of this feels like a given by the end of volume two. We know from the outset of the series that he has a tenuous relationship with them, but the fancy party that Sumire's author father drags her to as his plus-one (he's a single dad and appears to be mostly devoted to his daughter) reveals that there may be more than run-of-the-mill estrangement going on. One of the best scenes in the these volumes comes from volume two, when Sumire stands up to Reo's grandfather for him; she doesn't have a full grasp of what's going on, but she can tell from the impressively tense undercurrent to their conversation that he's pressuring Reo to do things he's not comfortable with, and since she doesn't have a horse in their race (so to speak), she's in a better position to speak up. It also emphasizes how much younger she is emotionally than Reo; she lacks a grasp of the social nuances of the situation, or at least is young enough that she doesn't care about them. It may be only a few years, but the scene really does emphasize how big a difference there can be between your late teens and early twenties in terms of understanding – and that Sumire's actions feel like the right ones may say something about the social pressures Reo has learned to cave to.    Naturally around this time in volume two we learn that he and Sumire knew each other in the past, and that she's inadvertently behind his switch from his bad-boy ways to where he is now. Reo refuses to say more than that, hedging that it was a small nothing to Sumire that meant the world to him, and that's intriguing, but it needs development if it is to be a mitigating factor in their budding romance's inappropriateness. There's also a bit of an insta-love feel to Sumire falling for him, made more prominent by the fact that she's more than ready for romance, as we see from her conversations with her best friend Rio. That does make him feel a bit more like ""convenient love"" than ""true love,"" although his attachment to her from the past does indicate that such will not always be the case. It's a contrived situation all around, but there's still enough here to make this worth following, especially if you've enjoyed Mikimoto's work before, and her ugly-cute art style with its chibis looks much better here than in previous series. (Although we won't talk about some of the questionable outfits that appear in the party chapters.) It's an age-gap romance with a different hook, and by volume two, that hook is baited well enough that it'll be hard to resist volume three.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B+ Art : B-  + Reo's reservations about Sumire balance out her insta-love, volume two is stronger overall. New character in volume two is fun. − Romance feels pretty abrupt, art isn't great at perspective. Very contrived starting plot.            discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Rin Mikimoto   Full encyclopedia details aboutLightning and Romance (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          38 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 38 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?      Review:         Synopsis:        Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?     Review:            If you've been reading Rin Mikimoto's previously translated works, you may have figured out that she has a thing for the age-gap romance – all of her other translated works but Kira-kun Today fall under that heading. This time she's trying something new in the field: rather than having her heroine fall in love with a teacher (Love's Reach) or a famous, slightly older celebrity (Kiss Me at the Stroke of Midnight), the older man Sumire falls for is in her high school class, and unlike titles like A Girl and Her Guard Dog, he appears to be there strictly to learn.    There's absolutely nothing wrong with going back at a nontraditional age to finish your education, so although it's odd, it's not bad that 20-year-old Reo is sitting in a second-year high school classroom even if in real life we more often see this play out at the university level. While people are confused about Reo's presence, no one really makes any disparaging remarks about it, possibly because they're all three-quarters convinced that he's some sort of evil yakuza delinquent, a belief that the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his cheek only reinforces. Reo doesn't necessarily seem to mind that his classmates are largely afraid of him, possibly because he's very much aware that he's an adult in a room full of children, and while we don't get any real answers about why he's completing high school now, the very fact that he is doing so seems to be more important, and that, if we extrapolate from volume two, it's borne out of a desire to make up for some misspent youth.    That he also is much more fervent in his attempts to fend Sumire off than some of Mikimoto's other heroes is a bit of a saving grace as well. He knows that this is maybe not an awesome relationship to be embarking on. He does his level best to drive Sumire away, putting on a very good show in volume one of being disinterested, one which begins to crumble a bit in volume two. This is at least in part because Sumire comes from the Chutzpah School of Romance Heroines, and she's not about to let him dictate her feelings – especially not when he's kind of bad at hiding that he may like her, too (which begins to creep out in the first book and becomes solidified in the second). Despite the reciprocal nature of their feelings, however, he remains unrelenting in his commitment to not date Sumire. While we can all make a good guess that this really isn't going to last, the “we can't” approach is a nice change from the “no, really, I swear I don't like you” tactic that I feel like we see more of in the genre. That he seems to have some very good reasons beyond simply being older than her is an intriguing bit of story-building, and while it may turn out to be reasons that only Reo thinks are important, just being able to stick to his guns around the very open Sumire does a nice job of illustrating to the reader that he really is an adult to her teenager.    That Reo's family is somehow involved in all of this feels like a given by the end of volume two. We know from the outset of the series that he has a tenuous relationship with them, but the fancy party that Sumire's author father drags her to as his plus-one (he's a single dad and appears to be mostly devoted to his daughter) reveals that there may be more than run-of-the-mill estrangement going on. One of the best scenes in the these volumes comes from volume two, when Sumire stands up to Reo's grandfather for him; she doesn't have a full grasp of what's going on, but she can tell from the impressively tense undercurrent to their conversation that he's pressuring Reo to do things he's not comfortable with, and since she doesn't have a horse in their race (so to speak), she's in a better position to speak up. It also emphasizes how much younger she is emotionally than Reo; she lacks a grasp of the social nuances of the situation, or at least is young enough that she doesn't care about them. It may be only a few years, but the scene really does emphasize how big a difference there can be between your late teens and early twenties in terms of understanding – and that Sumire's actions feel like the right ones may say something about the social pressures Reo has learned to cave to.    Naturally around this time in volume two we learn that he and Sumire knew each other in the past, and that she's inadvertently behind his switch from his bad-boy ways to where he is now. Reo refuses to say more than that, hedging that it was a small nothing to Sumire that meant the world to him, and that's intriguing, but it needs development if it is to be a mitigating factor in their budding romance's inappropriateness. There's also a bit of an insta-love feel to Sumire falling for him, made more prominent by the fact that she's more than ready for romance, as we see from her conversations with her best friend Rio. That does make him feel a bit more like ""convenient love"" than ""true love,"" although his attachment to her from the past does indicate that such will not always be the case. It's a contrived situation all around, but there's still enough here to make this worth following, especially if you've enjoyed Mikimoto's work before, and her ugly-cute art style with its chibis looks much better here than in previous series. (Although we won't talk about some of the questionable outfits that appear in the party chapters.) It's an age-gap romance with a different hook, and by volume two, that hook is baited well enough that it'll be hard to resist volume three.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B+ Art : B-  + Reo's reservations about Sumire balance out her insta-love, volume two is stronger overall. New character in volume two is fun. − Romance feels pretty abrupt, art isn't great at perspective.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022       Lightning and Romance GN 1-2                     Synopsis:             Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?      Review:         Synopsis:        Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?     Review:            If you've been reading Rin Mikimoto's previously translated works, you may have figured out that she has a thing for the age-gap romance – all of her other translated works but Kira-kun Today fall under that heading. This time she's trying something new in the field: rather than having her heroine fall in love with a teacher (Love's Reach) or a famous, slightly older celebrity (Kiss Me at the Stroke of Midnight), the older man Sumire falls for is in her high school class, and unlike titles like A Girl and Her Guard Dog, he appears to be there strictly to learn.    There's absolutely nothing wrong with going back at a nontraditional age to finish your education, so although it's odd, it's not bad that 20-year-old Reo is sitting in a second-year high school classroom even if in real life we more often see this play out at the university level. While people are confused about Reo's presence, no one really makes any disparaging remarks about it, possibly because they're all three-quarters convinced that he's some sort of evil yakuza delinquent, a belief that the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his cheek only reinforces. Reo doesn't necessarily seem to mind that his classmates are largely afraid of him, possibly because he's very much aware that he's an adult in a room full of children, and while we don't get any real answers about why he's completing high school now, the very fact that he is doing so seems to be more important, and that, if we extrapolate from volume two, it's borne out of a desire to make up for some misspent youth.    That he also is much more fervent in his attempts to fend Sumire off than some of Mikimoto's other heroes is a bit of a saving grace as well. He knows that this is maybe not an awesome relationship to be embarking on. He does his level best to drive Sumire away, putting on a very good show in volume one of being disinterested, one which begins to crumble a bit in volume two. This is at least in part because Sumire comes from the Chutzpah School of Romance Heroines, and she's not about to let him dictate her feelings – especially not when he's kind of bad at hiding that he may like her, too (which begins to creep out in the first book and becomes solidified in the second). Despite the reciprocal nature of their feelings, however, he remains unrelenting in his commitment to not date Sumire. While we can all make a good guess that this really isn't going to last, the “we can't” approach is a nice change from the “no, really, I swear I don't like you” tactic that I feel like we see more of in the genre. That he seems to have some very good reasons beyond simply being older than her is an intriguing bit of story-building, and while it may turn out to be reasons that only Reo thinks are important, just being able to stick to his guns around the very open Sumire does a nice job of illustrating to the reader that he really is an adult to her teenager.    That Reo's family is somehow involved in all of this feels like a given by the end of volume two. We know from the outset of the series that he has a tenuous relationship with them, but the fancy party that Sumire's author father drags her to as his plus-one (he's a single dad and appears to be mostly devoted to his daughter) reveals that there may be more than run-of-the-mill estrangement going on. One of the best scenes in the these volumes comes from volume two, when Sumire stands up to Reo's grandfather for him; she doesn't have a full grasp of what's going on, but she can tell from the impressively tense undercurrent to their conversation that he's pressuring Reo to do things he's not comfortable with, and since she doesn't have a horse in their race (so to speak), she's in a better position to speak up. It also emphasizes how much younger she is emotionally than Reo; she lacks a grasp of the social nuances of the situation, or at least is young enough that she doesn't care about them. It may be only a few years, but the scene really does emphasize how big a difference there can be between your late teens and early twenties in terms of understanding – and that Sumire's actions feel like the right ones may say something about the social pressures Reo has learned to cave to.    Naturally around this time in volume two we learn that he and Sumire knew each other in the past, and that she's inadvertently behind his switch from his bad-boy ways to where he is now. Reo refuses to say more than that, hedging that it was a small nothing to Sumire that meant the world to him, and that's intriguing, but it needs development if it is to be a mitigating factor in their budding romance's inappropriateness. There's also a bit of an insta-love feel to Sumire falling for him, made more prominent by the fact that she's more than ready for romance, as we see from her conversations with her best friend Rio. That does make him feel a bit more like ""convenient love"" than ""true love,"" although his attachment to her from the past does indicate that such will not always be the case. It's a contrived situation all around, but there's still enough here to make this worth following, especially if you've enjoyed Mikimoto's work before, and her ugly-cute art style with its chibis looks much better here than in previous series. (Although we won't talk about some of the questionable outfits that appear in the party chapters.) It's an age-gap romance with a different hook, and by volume two, that hook is baited well enough that it'll be hard to resist volume three.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022       Lightning and Romance GN 1-2                     Synopsis:             Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?      Review:         Synopsis:        Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?     Review:            If you've been reading Rin Mikimoto's previously translated works, you may have figured out that she has a thing for the age-gap romance – all of her other translated works but Kira-kun Today fall under that heading. This time she's trying something new in the field: rather than having her heroine fall in love with a teacher (Love's Reach) or a famous, slightly older celebrity (Kiss Me at the Stroke of Midnight), the older man Sumire falls for is in her high school class, and unlike titles like A Girl and Her Guard Dog, he appears to be there strictly to learn.    There's absolutely nothing wrong with going back at a nontraditional age to finish your education, so although it's odd, it's not bad that 20-year-old Reo is sitting in a second-year high school classroom even if in real life we more often see this play out at the university level. While people are confused about Reo's presence, no one really makes any disparaging remarks about it, possibly because they're all three-quarters convinced that he's some sort of evil yakuza delinquent, a belief that the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his cheek only reinforces. Reo doesn't necessarily seem to mind that his classmates are largely afraid of him, possibly because he's very much aware that he's an adult in a room full of children, and while we don't get any real answers about why he's completing high school now, the very fact that he is doing so seems to be more important, and that, if we extrapolate from volume two, it's borne out of a desire to make up for some misspent youth.    That he also is much more fervent in his attempts to fend Sumire off than some of Mikimoto's other heroes is a bit of a saving grace as well. He knows that this is maybe not an awesome relationship to be embarking on. He does his level best to drive Sumire away, putting on a very good show in volume one of being disinterested, one which begins to crumble a bit in volume two. This is at least in part because Sumire comes from the Chutzpah School of Romance Heroines, and she's not about to let him dictate her feelings – especially not when he's kind of bad at hiding that he may like her, too (which begins to creep out in the first book and becomes solidified in the second). Despite the reciprocal nature of their feelings, however, he remains unrelenting in his commitment to not date Sumire. While we can all make a good guess that this really isn't going to last, the “we can't” approach is a nice change from the “no, really, I swear I don't like you” tactic that I feel like we see more of in the genre. That he seems to have some very good reasons beyond simply being older than her is an intriguing bit of story-building, and while it may turn out to be reasons that only Reo thinks are important, just being able to stick to his guns around the very open Sumire does a nice job of illustrating to the reader that he really is an adult to her teenager.    That Reo's family is somehow involved in all of this feels like a given by the end of volume two. We know from the outset of the series that he has a tenuous relationship with them, but the fancy party that Sumire's author father drags her to as his plus-one (he's a single dad and appears to be mostly devoted to his daughter) reveals that there may be more than run-of-the-mill estrangement going on. One of the best scenes in the these volumes comes from volume two, when Sumire stands up to Reo's grandfather for him; she doesn't have a full grasp of what's going on, but she can tell from the impressively tense undercurrent to their conversation that he's pressuring Reo to do things he's not comfortable with, and since she doesn't have a horse in their race (so to speak), she's in a better position to speak up. It also emphasizes how much younger she is emotionally than Reo; she lacks a grasp of the social nuances of the situation, or at least is young enough that she doesn't care about them. It may be only a few years, but the scene really does emphasize how big a difference there can be between your late teens and early twenties in terms of understanding – and that Sumire's actions feel like the right ones may say something about the social pressures Reo has learned to cave to.    Naturally around this time in volume two we learn that he and Sumire knew each other in the past, and that she's inadvertently behind his switch from his bad-boy ways to where he is now. Reo refuses to say more than that, hedging that it was a small nothing to Sumire that meant the world to him, and that's intriguing, but it needs development if it is to be a mitigating factor in their budding romance's inappropriateness. There's also a bit of an insta-love feel to Sumire falling for him, made more prominent by the fact that she's more than ready for romance, as we see from her conversations with her best friend Rio. That does make him feel a bit more like ""convenient love"" than ""true love,"" although his attachment to her from the past does indicate that such will not always be the case. It's a contrived situation all around, but there's still enough here to make this worth following, especially if you've enjoyed Mikimoto's work before, and her ugly-cute art style with its chibis looks much better here than in previous series. (Although we won't talk about some of the questionable outfits that appear in the party chapters.) It's an age-gap romance with a different hook, and by volume two, that hook is baited well enough that it'll be hard to resist volume three.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B+ Art : B-  + Reo's reservations about Sumire balance out her insta-love, volume two is stronger overall.
