Ranking of Kings Episodes 22-23  by Lynzee Loveridge, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 22 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 23 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.4           It's time for the epilogue of Ranking of Kings. Bosse is dead, Daida is back in control of his faculties, Ouken is compressed inside of a giant boulder, and all the major players are alive barring a few missing limbs. The final two episodes seek to put a bow on most of the straggling threads and reassert the series' overall thesis of abandoning malice for empathy and forgiveness. Ranking of Kings has long been married to this idea that there is no true villainy (sans episode 18) and while I can appreciate its commitment, it's asking a lot of its audience in these final moments.    Primarily, it's asking us to forgive Miranjo, a horrifically abused woman who nonetheless orchestrated the murder of Bojji's mom, influenced Daida to have his brother assassinated, attempted to have Hiling torn apart by mind-controlled beasts, unleashed Ouken on the general populous, recommended the process of stealing Bojji's physical strength, and betrayed Daida so he would be possessed by his father. And now Daida wants everyone to forgive her and intends on marrying her. Miranjo could best be described as Daida's mentor/step-sister/step-mom, and I couldn't even estimate their age gap. This isn't so much a case of ""she's too old for him"" as Miranjo, despite all her scheming, has seemed somewhat emotionally immature throughout the series.    The issue is that I've head-canoned Daida as maybe 14 throughout most of the series and I take his love confession with about the same amount of seriousness. I can believe that he already had a trusting relationship with Miranjo over the course of her mentoring him while she was in the mirror. I can believe that he gained a sense of protectiveness over her after he witnessed her childhood and spent time with that child version of her inside of his father's memories. However, I don't perceive Daida as a ""man"" and so all of his proclamations, as genuine as they seem to him, still sound like they're coming from a little kid.    I'm also just a little pissed off that his recklessness lost Despa his chance to cure his brother and likely set into motion what would be the next act of the story: Desha's choice to accept a gift from the vault. While this part of Ranking of Kings' world is still a mystery, we can infer that the Ranking system and the cursed treasures are likely some kind of ploy by the gods to keep the humans from gaining too much power and overthrowing them. I'd love to see this expanded on in a second season, but until then, this development remains an enticing cliffhanger.    Also, while it's entirely out of left field, shout out to Kingbo for arriving late to the party just to dropkick Ouken's head into a lake. Chaotic king shit.    Most of the final episode is an extremely well-animated (watch for the many POV shots) bit of closure with a minor conflict. We see Bojji accepted as king (hurray!) and that being king is kind of boring (bureaucracy, boo!) especially without your best friend by your side. Kage takes off for a bit of ham-fisted emotional conflict in the final moments but it isn't all just to kill time: it also gives Bojji and Hiling a moment to reconcile some of the emotional damage that her step-son carries and she reassures him that it is okay for him to want things for himself even when he has a responsibility to his people. The result? Bojji still has a lot of the world left to see and he's fine letting his brother manage things in his stead while he goes off on the journey he always wanted, with his best friend by his side.    When I first started reviewing this series, I talked about how Bojji held special importance to me as a parent. His journey has unfolded over the last half year and I often found it reaffirming. If Bojji could find a best friend like Kage, a supportive ray of sunshine, then my son could, too. The series often showed that even in a world with unimaginable depths of cruelty, a community can still be forged in empathy and kindness. I think all of us need to know that.

Ranking of Kings Episodes 22-23  by Lynzee Loveridge, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 22 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 23 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.4           It's time for the epilogue of Ranking of Kings. Bosse is dead, Daida is back in control of his faculties, Ouken is compressed inside of a giant boulder, and all the major players are alive barring a few missing limbs. The final two episodes seek to put a bow on most of the straggling threads and reassert the series' overall thesis of abandoning malice for empathy and forgiveness. Ranking of Kings has long been married to this idea that there is no true villainy (sans episode 18) and while I can appreciate its commitment, it's asking a lot of its audience in these final moments.    Primarily, it's asking us to forgive Miranjo, a horrifically abused woman who nonetheless orchestrated the murder of Bojji's mom, influenced Daida to have his brother assassinated, attempted to have Hiling torn apart by mind-controlled beasts, unleashed Ouken on the general populous, recommended the process of stealing Bojji's physical strength, and betrayed Daida so he would be possessed by his father. And now Daida wants everyone to forgive her and intends on marrying her. Miranjo could best be described as Daida's mentor/step-sister/step-mom, and I couldn't even estimate their age gap. This isn't so much a case of ""she's too old for him"" as Miranjo, despite all her scheming, has seemed somewhat emotionally immature throughout the series.    The issue is that I've head-canoned Daida as maybe 14 throughout most of the series and I take his love confession with about the same amount of seriousness. I can believe that he already had a trusting relationship with Miranjo over the course of her mentoring him while she was in the mirror. I can believe that he gained a sense of protectiveness over her after he witnessed her childhood and spent time with that child version of her inside of his father's memories. However, I don't perceive Daida as a ""man"" and so all of his proclamations, as genuine as they seem to him, still sound like they're coming from a little kid.    I'm also just a little pissed off that his recklessness lost Despa his chance to cure his brother and likely set into motion what would be the next act of the story: Desha's choice to accept a gift from the vault. While this part of Ranking of Kings' world is still a mystery, we can infer that the Ranking system and the cursed treasures are likely some kind of ploy by the gods to keep the humans from gaining too much power and overthrowing them. I'd love to see this expanded on in a second season, but until then, this development remains an enticing cliffhanger.    Also, while it's entirely out of left field, shout out to Kingbo for arriving late to the party just to dropkick Ouken's head into a lake. Chaotic king shit.    Most of the final episode is an extremely well-animated (watch for the many POV shots) bit of closure with a minor conflict. We see Bojji accepted as king (hurray!) and that being king is kind of boring (bureaucracy, boo!) especially without your best friend by your side. Kage takes off for a bit of ham-fisted emotional conflict in the final moments but it isn't all just to kill time: it also gives Bojji and Hiling a moment to reconcile some of the emotional damage that her step-son carries and she reassures him that it is okay for him to want things for himself even when he has a responsibility to his people. The result? Bojji still has a lot of the world left to see and he's fine letting his brother manage things in his stead while he goes off on the journey he always wanted, with his best friend by his side.    When I first started reviewing this series, I talked about how Bojji held special importance to me as a parent. His journey has unfolded over the last half year and I often found it reaffirming. If Bojji could find a best friend like Kage, a supportive ray of sunshine, then my son could, too. The series often showed that even in a world with unimaginable depths of cruelty, a community can still be forged in empathy and kindness. I think all of us need to know that.

Ranking of Kings Episodes 22-23  by Lynzee Loveridge, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 22 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 23 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.4           It's time for the epilogue of Ranking of Kings. Bosse is dead, Daida is back in control of his faculties, Ouken is compressed inside of a giant boulder, and all the major players are alive barring a few missing limbs. The final two episodes seek to put a bow on most of the straggling threads and reassert the series' overall thesis of abandoning malice for empathy and forgiveness. Ranking of Kings has long been married to this idea that there is no true villainy (sans episode 18) and while I can appreciate its commitment, it's asking a lot of its audience in these final moments.    Primarily, it's asking us to forgive Miranjo, a horrifically abused woman who nonetheless orchestrated the murder of Bojji's mom, influenced Daida to have his brother assassinated, attempted to have Hiling torn apart by mind-controlled beasts, unleashed Ouken on the general populous, recommended the process of stealing Bojji's physical strength, and betrayed Daida so he would be possessed by his father. And now Daida wants everyone to forgive her and intends on marrying her. Miranjo could best be described as Daida's mentor/step-sister/step-mom, and I couldn't even estimate their age gap. This isn't so much a case of ""she's too old for him"" as Miranjo, despite all her scheming, has seemed somewhat emotionally immature throughout the series.    The issue is that I've head-canoned Daida as maybe 14 throughout most of the series and I take his love confession with about the same amount of seriousness. I can believe that he already had a trusting relationship with Miranjo over the course of her mentoring him while she was in the mirror. I can believe that he gained a sense of protectiveness over her after he witnessed her childhood and spent time with that child version of her inside of his father's memories. However, I don't perceive Daida as a ""man"" and so all of his proclamations, as genuine as they seem to him, still sound like they're coming from a little kid.    I'm also just a little pissed off that his recklessness lost Despa his chance to cure his brother and likely set into motion what would be the next act of the story: Desha's choice to accept a gift from the vault. While this part of Ranking of Kings' world is still a mystery, we can infer that the Ranking system and the cursed treasures are likely some kind of ploy by the gods to keep the humans from gaining too much power and overthrowing them. I'd love to see this expanded on in a second season, but until then, this development remains an enticing cliffhanger.    Also, while it's entirely out of left field, shout out to Kingbo for arriving late to the party just to dropkick Ouken's head into a lake. Chaotic king shit.    Most of the final episode is an extremely well-animated (watch for the many POV shots) bit of closure with a minor conflict. We see Bojji accepted as king (hurray!) and that being king is kind of boring (bureaucracy, boo!) especially without your best friend by your side. Kage takes off for a bit of ham-fisted emotional conflict in the final moments but it isn't all just to kill time: it also gives Bojji and Hiling a moment to reconcile some of the emotional damage that her step-son carries and she reassures him that it is okay for him to want things for himself even when he has a responsibility to his people. The result? Bojji still has a lot of the world left to see and he's fine letting his brother manage things in his stead while he goes off on the journey he always wanted, with his best friend by his side.    When I first started reviewing this series, I talked about how Bojji held special importance to me as a parent. His journey has unfolded over the last half year and I often found it reaffirming. If Bojji could find a best friend like Kage, a supportive ray of sunshine, then my son could, too. The series often showed that even in a world with unimaginable depths of cruelty, a community can still be forged in empathy and kindness. I think all of us need to know that.

Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout Episode 12  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Fantasy Bishōjo Juniku Ojisan to ?                     Community score: 4.2            My god they actually did it. No, they didn't commit to Tachibana and Jinguuji as a trashboi OTP, but for the first time in possibly the entire show, they actually let our central couple have a sincere moment of connection and vulnerability. And they even managed to extricate that annoying brainwashing part without it getting in the way of the important stuff! Good on ya, show.    Though my (incredibly biased) favorite part of this finale is definitely Schwartz von Lichtenstein Lohengramm of all people having to be the emotionally mature adult in the situation, and straight-up tell Jinguuji that there's nothing wrong or shameful about showing he cares about Tachibana. This boy may be a dipstick in SAO cosplay, but even he knows that It's important to tell your friends how much they mean to you, because otherwise they'll never know. You know you've got some serious emotional hang-ups when a chuuni high-schooler is your relationship counselor.    It's a good thing Jinguuji regains his super strength here, because it turns out he's got a whole airport of baggage he's been carrying around. We'd seen bits and pieces of his past and a less-than-happy family life, but here we see just how deep that all burrowed. He was raised not just in a strict and traditional household, but one that sought to stomp out any perceived weakness or vulnerability in Jinguuji as a child, teaching him that relying on others was shameful, and to remain stoic no matter what. It's a toxic mindset that he only barely escaped thanks to Tachibana's friendship, but it's left him all but incapable of being emotionally honest or vulnerable with anyone. But with the help of Love Doctor Schwartz, and with his only real friendship on the line, he's finally able to open up.    By which I mean he opens up the entire Hoover Dam and floods millions of metric tons of emotions on Tachibana all at once. It's astounding just how long his Friendship Rant goes on without pause, and even more impressive that it so masterfully straddles the line between sincere sentiment and the sardonic humor the show is built upon. You really do get the sense that all the little quirks to Tachibana's personality, from mundane things like how he likes animals, to how much he considers others around him, are important enough to Jinguuji that he's got them all committed to memory. The romantic subtext there is obvious to everyone except Jinguuji himself, but of course we can't actually resolve that, so instead Tachibana just blushes into another dimension at the onslaught of affection. Thus their initial game of Gay Chicken is back in full force, ready to drive both these idiots crazy until they finally admit their feelings.    It's a great punchline to go out on, and only slightly hampered by the need to stretch out the denouement to lead into a potential second season. Not that I'd be unhappy if a sequel happened – one of my biggest disappointments with the show is how its extended cast has largely been left by the wayside, so the idea of Yggie and the other characters all venturing out on their own journeys with the promise of encountering our heroes again is a good one. I'd just prefer if the show hadn't spent quite so long on what amounts to “and their adventures continued!” coda.    On the whole though, Total Fantasy Knockout has been a fun time. It's had its weaker episodes and clunky jokes, but at its best this series could be a crass and loud blast.  I just wish it had been at its best more often than it was, because there are a couple episodes that are total riots, balancing the various characters and punchlines perfectly, while more than a few averaged out to “okay” after meandering around with weak gags for far too long. As it stands it's still a solid comedy, and one of the more entertaining isekai of this season, but I can't give it a particularly strong recommendation. I can, however, hope it does well enough that they actually give us a full Schwartz spin-off.

Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout Episode 12  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Fantasy Bishōjo Juniku Ojisan to ?                     Community score: 4.2            My god they actually did it. No, they didn't commit to Tachibana and Jinguuji as a trashboi OTP, but for the first time in possibly the entire show, they actually let our central couple have a sincere moment of connection and vulnerability. And they even managed to extricate that annoying brainwashing part without it getting in the way of the important stuff! Good on ya, show.    Though my (incredibly biased) favorite part of this finale is definitely Schwartz von Lichtenstein Lohengramm of all people having to be the emotionally mature adult in the situation, and straight-up tell Jinguuji that there's nothing wrong or shameful about showing he cares about Tachibana. This boy may be a dipstick in SAO cosplay, but even he knows that It's important to tell your friends how much they mean to you, because otherwise they'll never know. You know you've got some serious emotional hang-ups when a chuuni high-schooler is your relationship counselor.    It's a good thing Jinguuji regains his super strength here, because it turns out he's got a whole airport of baggage he's been carrying around. We'd seen bits and pieces of his past and a less-than-happy family life, but here we see just how deep that all burrowed. He was raised not just in a strict and traditional household, but one that sought to stomp out any perceived weakness or vulnerability in Jinguuji as a child, teaching him that relying on others was shameful, and to remain stoic no matter what. It's a toxic mindset that he only barely escaped thanks to Tachibana's friendship, but it's left him all but incapable of being emotionally honest or vulnerable with anyone. But with the help of Love Doctor Schwartz, and with his only real friendship on the line, he's finally able to open up.    By which I mean he opens up the entire Hoover Dam and floods millions of metric tons of emotions on Tachibana all at once. It's astounding just how long his Friendship Rant goes on without pause, and even more impressive that it so masterfully straddles the line between sincere sentiment and the sardonic humor the show is built upon. You really do get the sense that all the little quirks to Tachibana's personality, from mundane things like how he likes animals, to how much he considers others around him, are important enough to Jinguuji that he's got them all committed to memory. The romantic subtext there is obvious to everyone except Jinguuji himself, but of course we can't actually resolve that, so instead Tachibana just blushes into another dimension at the onslaught of affection. Thus their initial game of Gay Chicken is back in full force, ready to drive both these idiots crazy until they finally admit their feelings.    It's a great punchline to go out on, and only slightly hampered by the need to stretch out the denouement to lead into a potential second season. Not that I'd be unhappy if a sequel happened – one of my biggest disappointments with the show is how its extended cast has largely been left by the wayside, so the idea of Yggie and the other characters all venturing out on their own journeys with the promise of encountering our heroes again is a good one. I'd just prefer if the show hadn't spent quite so long on what amounts to “and their adventures continued!” coda.    On the whole though, Total Fantasy Knockout has been a fun time. It's had its weaker episodes and clunky jokes, but at its best this series could be a crass and loud blast.  I just wish it had been at its best more often than it was, because there are a couple episodes that are total riots, balancing the various characters and punchlines perfectly, while more than a few averaged out to “okay” after meandering around with weak gags for far too long. As it stands it's still a solid comedy, and one of the more entertaining isekai of this season, but I can't give it a particularly strong recommendation. I can, however, hope it does well enough that they actually give us a full Schwartz spin-off.

Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout Episode 12  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Fantasy Bishōjo Juniku Ojisan to ?                     Community score: 4.2            My god they actually did it. No, they didn't commit to Tachibana and Jinguuji as a trashboi OTP, but for the first time in possibly the entire show, they actually let our central couple have a sincere moment of connection and vulnerability. And they even managed to extricate that annoying brainwashing part without it getting in the way of the important stuff! Good on ya, show.    Though my (incredibly biased) favorite part of this finale is definitely Schwartz von Lichtenstein Lohengramm of all people having to be the emotionally mature adult in the situation, and straight-up tell Jinguuji that there's nothing wrong or shameful about showing he cares about Tachibana. This boy may be a dipstick in SAO cosplay, but even he knows that It's important to tell your friends how much they mean to you, because otherwise they'll never know. You know you've got some serious emotional hang-ups when a chuuni high-schooler is your relationship counselor.    It's a good thing Jinguuji regains his super strength here, because it turns out he's got a whole airport of baggage he's been carrying around. We'd seen bits and pieces of his past and a less-than-happy family life, but here we see just how deep that all burrowed. He was raised not just in a strict and traditional household, but one that sought to stomp out any perceived weakness or vulnerability in Jinguuji as a child, teaching him that relying on others was shameful, and to remain stoic no matter what. It's a toxic mindset that he only barely escaped thanks to Tachibana's friendship, but it's left him all but incapable of being emotionally honest or vulnerable with anyone. But with the help of Love Doctor Schwartz, and with his only real friendship on the line, he's finally able to open up.    By which I mean he opens up the entire Hoover Dam and floods millions of metric tons of emotions on Tachibana all at once. It's astounding just how long his Friendship Rant goes on without pause, and even more impressive that it so masterfully straddles the line between sincere sentiment and the sardonic humor the show is built upon. You really do get the sense that all the little quirks to Tachibana's personality, from mundane things like how he likes animals, to how much he considers others around him, are important enough to Jinguuji that he's got them all committed to memory. The romantic subtext there is obvious to everyone except Jinguuji himself, but of course we can't actually resolve that, so instead Tachibana just blushes into another dimension at the onslaught of affection. Thus their initial game of Gay Chicken is back in full force, ready to drive both these idiots crazy until they finally admit their feelings.    It's a great punchline to go out on, and only slightly hampered by the need to stretch out the denouement to lead into a potential second season. Not that I'd be unhappy if a sequel happened – one of my biggest disappointments with the show is how its extended cast has largely been left by the wayside, so the idea of Yggie and the other characters all venturing out on their own journeys with the promise of encountering our heroes again is a good one. I'd just prefer if the show hadn't spent quite so long on what amounts to “and their adventures continued!” coda.    On the whole though, Total Fantasy Knockout has been a fun time. It's had its weaker episodes and clunky jokes, but at its best this series could be a crass and loud blast.  I just wish it had been at its best more often than it was, because there are a couple episodes that are total riots, balancing the various characters and punchlines perfectly, while more than a few averaged out to “okay” after meandering around with weak gags for far too long. As it stands it's still a solid comedy, and one of the more entertaining isekai of this season, but I can't give it a particularly strong recommendation. I can, however, hope it does well enough that they actually give us a full Schwartz spin-off.

Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout Episode 12  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Fantasy Bishōjo Juniku Ojisan to ?                     Community score: 4.2            My god they actually did it. No, they didn't commit to Tachibana and Jinguuji as a trashboi OTP, but for the first time in possibly the entire show, they actually let our central couple have a sincere moment of connection and vulnerability. And they even managed to extricate that annoying brainwashing part without it getting in the way of the important stuff! Good on ya, show.    Though my (incredibly biased) favorite part of this finale is definitely Schwartz von Lichtenstein Lohengramm of all people having to be the emotionally mature adult in the situation, and straight-up tell Jinguuji that there's nothing wrong or shameful about showing he cares about Tachibana. This boy may be a dipstick in SAO cosplay, but even he knows that It's important to tell your friends how much they mean to you, because otherwise they'll never know. You know you've got some serious emotional hang-ups when a chuuni high-schooler is your relationship counselor.    It's a good thing Jinguuji regains his super strength here, because it turns out he's got a whole airport of baggage he's been carrying around. We'd seen bits and pieces of his past and a less-than-happy family life, but here we see just how deep that all burrowed. He was raised not just in a strict and traditional household, but one that sought to stomp out any perceived weakness or vulnerability in Jinguuji as a child, teaching him that relying on others was shameful, and to remain stoic no matter what. It's a toxic mindset that he only barely escaped thanks to Tachibana's friendship, but it's left him all but incapable of being emotionally honest or vulnerable with anyone. But with the help of Love Doctor Schwartz, and with his only real friendship on the line, he's finally able to open up.    By which I mean he opens up the entire Hoover Dam and floods millions of metric tons of emotions on Tachibana all at once. It's astounding just how long his Friendship Rant goes on without pause, and even more impressive that it so masterfully straddles the line between sincere sentiment and the sardonic humor the show is built upon. You really do get the sense that all the little quirks to Tachibana's personality, from mundane things like how he likes animals, to how much he considers others around him, are important enough to Jinguuji that he's got them all committed to memory. The romantic subtext there is obvious to everyone except Jinguuji himself, but of course we can't actually resolve that, so instead Tachibana just blushes into another dimension at the onslaught of affection. Thus their initial game of Gay Chicken is back in full force, ready to drive both these idiots crazy until they finally admit their feelings.    It's a great punchline to go out on, and only slightly hampered by the need to stretch out the denouement to lead into a potential second season. Not that I'd be unhappy if a sequel happened – one of my biggest disappointments with the show is how its extended cast has largely been left by the wayside, so the idea of Yggie and the other characters all venturing out on their own journeys with the promise of encountering our heroes again is a good one. I'd just prefer if the show hadn't spent quite so long on what amounts to “and their adventures continued!” coda.    On the whole though, Total Fantasy Knockout has been a fun time. It's had its weaker episodes and clunky jokes, but at its best this series could be a crass and loud blast.  I just wish it had been at its best more often than it was, because there are a couple episodes that are total riots, balancing the various characters and punchlines perfectly, while more than a few averaged out to “okay” after meandering around with weak gags for far too long. As it stands it's still a solid comedy, and one of the more entertaining isekai of this season, but I can't give it a particularly strong recommendation. I can, however, hope it does well enough that they actually give us a full Schwartz spin-off.

The ad celebrates the manga's first compiled volume, which will ship on April 4.      Sōichirō launched the manga on Shonen Jump+ on December 4, and Sōichirō publishes a new chapter every other week.    The manga centers on Leo, the strongest hunting lifeform in the universe. Leo comes to Earth from space to devour all life on this planet, and while investigating he runs into a lone girl. He considers eating her, but she instead introduces him to the deliciousness of fresh vegetables.

Heidi breaks down what to expect. ― Greetings, everyone! I am quite relieved today, as it was very likely TWIG might not have happened this week.

Heidi breaks down what to expect. ― Greetings, everyone! I am quite relieved today, as it was very likely TWIG might not have happened this week.

It feels like forever since we first saw the game revealed. Surprise, surprise – it's suffering from COVID-related development setbacks. ― Here we are, on the final day of 2021.

Kind of. So, who won? ― Hey folks! By the time you read this, the internet will be on the cusp of going completely bonkers over Deltarune Chapter 2.

By Diane Darcy Published 1 day ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Episode 12 of The Strongest Sage With The Weakest Crest, ""The Strongest Sage Goes on a Journey Again,"" now streaming on Crunchyroll. In Episode 1 of The Strongest Sage With The Weakest, Gaius induced his reincarnation to obtain the four crests he desired. In the era of his original incarnation, the four crests were considered the most powerful in battle. 5,000 years later, Gaius is reborn with the four crests as a boy named Matthias “Matty” Hildesheimer, although in this timeline, the four crests is rejected as the weakest. As such, he was only able to enroll in the second-tier magic school known as the Second Academy in the kingdom of Eis.  Throughout the series, Matty reveals that he retained the memories of his past incarnation and uses his past life experiences in battles against demons. He also reveals through exposition the magical tools he invented in his past life that allow him to win fights against demons with little to no effort. During his stay at the Second Academy, Matty befriended his classmates Lurie and Alma, although he hasn't said anything about who he really is to them. Along the way, he was also reacquainted with his old friend Iris the darkness dragon -- the only one who knows his secret. RELATED: The Strongest Sage Meets His Equal as a Demon Slayer                  After stopping various demonic invasions throughout the series, Matty encountered a demonic presence he couldn't beat: the ancient demon Zardias who knew him as Gaius. Since that discovery, Matty set about locating the demon, which required the use of an ancient device he invented. Unfortunately for Matty, Zardias broke out of his magic prison the moment he determined his location and set course for the kingdom of Eis. With his resident kingdom in danger, Matty tasks Lurie and Alma with retrieving an ancient sword he invented in his former life while he battles Zardias alongside Iris. The fight against Zardias proves to be nothing like Matty's earlier battles. Zardias is a lot stronger and deadlier than the demons Matty previously defeated, and his strategies don't work on the ancient demon. On top of that, Zardias shows he has tricks of his own, one of which ends up wounding Matty. This forces Matty to realize he'll have to sacrifice his current incarnation to defeat the demon, or humanity is done for. Since letting humanity die is not an option for Matty, he contemplates using his remaining magic to kill the demon and perform another reincarnation spell to save himself. While reincarnation is Matty's only viable option in a deadly situation, there's one problem: if he reincarnates into another future timeline, Lurie and Alma will no longer be part of his life, as they will be long dead. Realizing he has grown fond of both girls and wants to remain with them along with Iris, Matty decides to hold off the demon a bit longer until Lurie arrives with the sword he needs. While Lurie does succeed at her task, Zardias delivers a fatal attack on Matty when he's not looking, successfully killing him. RELATED: The Strongest Sage: A Demonic Encounter Nearly Kills a Powerful Demon Slayer                  Seeing Matty brutally killed before her eyes proves too much for Lurie to handle. This feeling is only made worse by the fact she had given Matty the sword just seconds before Zardias impaled him with his own weapon. Before Lurie has the chance to grieve Matty's death, however, the sword in his possession activates and restores him to life. The sword also restores his magic, making him stronger and more powerful than before. This gives Matty the power boost he needs to destroy Zardias, which he does quickly without any consequence to himself. In the aftermath of the battle, everything in the kingdom of Eis returns to normal as if the threat of Zardias never happened. Even after his brief run-in with death, Matty doesn't seem fazed by the events that transpired. Lurie, however, is very shaken by the experience and admits her feelings for Matty by hugging him. While Matty doesn't use this opportunity to reciprocate her feelings, he does decide to do something nice for her to subtly let her know how much she means to him. While out shopping with the reward money he earned for defeating Zardias, Matty buys a blue stone that he reshapes into a pendant for a necklace. When he asks Lurie to meet him in private one night, Lurie thinks the intimate nature of their meeting is going to lead to them kissing. However, Matty only gives her the necklace he made for her. Although Lurie is grateful for Matty's gift, she doesn't take it as romantic confirmation of his feelings. Matty also doesn't use this opportunity to tell her the truth of who he really is or his past as Gaius as a way of progressing their relationship. This indicates that while Matty does love Lurie, he also doesn't trust her enough to tell her his secret. As such, The Strongest Sage With The Weakest Crest ends its first season on a rather anticlimactic note.

Here's a preview for the highly-anticipated Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie.     By Louis Kemner Published 19 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The Spring 2022 anime season will be filled with a colorful variety of new and returning series, from Season 2 of the isekai adventure The Rising of the Shield Hero to the return of the beloved Netflix hit Komi Can't Communicate. But Komi has some fresh new competition this season, including the highly anticipated Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This brand new series features a small but lovable cast of main characters, most of whom are high school students living their ordinary lives. The charming heroine Shikimori, however, is anything but an ordinary student. She promises to be a shojo-style shonen heroine unlike any other when the story begins airing on Crunchyroll in April. Here's a brief preview of what to expect.  RELATED: The Most Anticipated New & Returning Rom-Com Anime of Spring 2022 The Premise Of Shikimori's Not Just A Cutie                  Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is a fresh new slice-of-life romance/comedy anime, in a similar vein to popular series such as Komi Can't Communicate and the beloved Horimiya. Although Shikimori isn't about to redefine the possibilities of high school or slice-of-life anime, the series should appeal to any fan who can't get enough of the genre while also looking for assertive, strong female leads who can carry an entire series on their own. More and more anime today are giving girls a chance to shine as the protagonist in a variety of genres, from Komi Shoko to Love of Kill's seinen-style shojo heroine Chateau Dankworth. It's a trend that is absolutely worth continuing in the spring season with Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This anime stars the shonen heroine Shikimori, a lively pink-haired student who is definitely the more assertive and dynamic member of her relationship with the meek but kind Izumi. During their idyllic high school days together, Shikimori will take the lead as the attention-grabbing star who can do it all, from competitive sports in gym class to being an everyday hero who can rescue her boyfriend from harm when things go wrong -- and she's an ace student to boot. Shikimori is also known for giving off harsh glares that can make anyone back off and not want to mess with her. Meanwhile, her boyfriend Izumi mainly just follows her lead, but over time he may grow more assertive as well and make something of himself. RELATED: Rising of the Shield Hero and Spy x Family Headline Crunchyroll's Spring 2022 Season Where To Watch or Read Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie                  Anyone who is excited to dive into the story of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie doesn't have long to wait. The anime is due to begin airing in Japan on April 10, 2022, and will be available to stream on the Crunchyroll platform in the West. Meanwhile, interested fans can also try out the still-ongoing Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie manga, written and drawn by Keigo Maki. The series has amassed 11 volumes so far, and paperback copies can be found through Barnes & Noble's online catalog, Right Stuf Anime's website and Amazon's online catalog in the books department. As of this writing, the first eight volumes are available in English with Volume 9 releasing on April 5. Those who prefer digital manga can also find Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie on Amazon with the Kindle version, or through Barnes and Noble's catalog with the Nook version.

03-04-2022,anime,8,0,https://www.cbr.com/shikimori-not-just-a-cutie-spring-anime-preview/,Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie: What to Know Before the Anime Begins,"   Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie: Everything to Know Before the Anime Starts The Spring 2022 anime season promises many great rom-com titles. Here's a preview for the highly-anticipated Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie.     By Louis Kemner Published 19 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The Spring 2022 anime season will be filled with a colorful variety of new and returning series, from Season 2 of the isekai adventure The Rising of the Shield Hero to the return of the beloved Netflix hit Komi Can't Communicate. But Komi has some fresh new competition this season, including the highly anticipated Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This brand new series features a small but lovable cast of main characters, most of whom are high school students living their ordinary lives. The charming heroine Shikimori, however, is anything but an ordinary student. She promises to be a shojo-style shonen heroine unlike any other when the story begins airing on Crunchyroll in April. Here's a brief preview of what to expect.  RELATED: The Most Anticipated New & Returning Rom-Com Anime of Spring 2022 The Premise Of Shikimori's Not Just A Cutie                  Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is a fresh new slice-of-life romance/comedy anime, in a similar vein to popular series such as Komi Can't Communicate and the beloved Horimiya. Although Shikimori isn't about to redefine the possibilities of high school or slice-of-life anime, the series should appeal to any fan who can't get enough of the genre while also looking for assertive, strong female leads who can carry an entire series on their own. More and more anime today are giving girls a chance to shine as the protagonist in a variety of genres, from Komi Shoko to Love of Kill's seinen-style shojo heroine Chateau Dankworth. It's a trend that is absolutely worth continuing in the spring season with Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This anime stars the shonen heroine Shikimori, a lively pink-haired student who is definitely the more assertive and dynamic member of her relationship with the meek but kind Izumi. During their idyllic high school days together, Shikimori will take the lead as the attention-grabbing star who can do it all, from competitive sports in gym class to being an everyday hero who can rescue her boyfriend from harm when things go wrong -- and she's an ace student to boot. Shikimori is also known for giving off harsh glares that can make anyone back off and not want to mess with her. Meanwhile, her boyfriend Izumi mainly just follows her lead, but over time he may grow more assertive as well and make something of himself. RELATED: Rising of the Shield Hero and Spy x Family Headline Crunchyroll's Spring 2022 Season Where To Watch or Read Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie                  Anyone who is excited to dive into the story of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie doesn't have long to wait. The anime is due to begin airing in Japan on April 10, 2022, and will be available to stream on the Crunchyroll platform in the West. Meanwhile, interested fans can also try out the still-ongoing Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie manga, written and drawn by Keigo Maki. The series has amassed 11 volumes so far, and paperback copies can be found through Barnes & Noble's online catalog, Right Stuf Anime's website and Amazon's online catalog in the books department. As of this writing, the first eight volumes are available in English with Volume 9 releasing on April 5. Those who prefer digital manga can also find Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie on Amazon with the Kindle version, or through Barnes and Noble's catalog with the Nook version.

By Louis Kemner Published 2 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The Rising of the Shield Hero is a grim but popular isekai anime series that is due to return in the Spring 2022 anime season for another round of adventure. In some ways, Shield Hero is a fairly conventional fantasy anime series that checks off all the boxes, but it does find ways to refresh the ideas, conventions, and even cliches that it explores. Not only did Shield Hero subvert the isekai harem concept with a more wholesome adventuring party for Naofumi, but Episode 23 of the first season also featured a token beach scene without resorting to worn-out cliches. Some anime series have a superficial approach to their beach episodes, but not Shield Hero. Here's how the series continued to set itself apart from its contemporaries.  RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling's Beach Episode is Packed With Meaning Naofumi's Productive Adventure To Cal Mira's Beach In Shield Hero                   Late in Shield Hero's first season, the hero Iwatani Naofumi got his name cleared at last in the Melromarc royal court. This meant he got invited along for an XP-grinding vacation to the pleasant Cal Mira archipelago with the other Cardinal Heroes and their allies. Naofumi was overdue for a change of scenery by now, and Shield Hero smartly blended the well-worn ""beach episode"" concept with a bonus adventure filled with action, adventure, and even a few new characters, namely L'Arc and his ally Therese. The Cal Mira archipelago had a pleasant Pacific vibe, complete with a tourist-friendly coastal town and sunny beaches, and Naofumi's party made the most of it. During this story sequence, Shield Hero allowed Naofumi to catch up to the other three heroes and share what he knew with them. It gave the beach sequence a sense of purpose and progress. Best of all, there was a plot twist in store for the heroes. Not long after Naofumi, Filo and the tanuki-girl Raphtalia arrived at the beach in their swimwear, Filo mentioned an underwater temple, so the group dove under the waves to check it out. Inside the abandoned temple, Naofumi discovered another dragon hourglass counting down to the next Wave, with barely 48 hours remaining until the next wave. This led to an exciting battle scene on the open sea near the archipelago, with the Cardinal Heroes, the queen, and a few galleons battling the aquatic Wave to conclude the season on a high note. All this gave Shield Hero's beach sequence a great deal of relevance to the plot, rather than feeling like an obligatory detour, and that makes all the difference. RELATED: How the Shield Hero Anime Refined the Isekai Harem Concept How Other Anime Series Handle Their Beach Episodes                  It's a running joke in the anime community that every anime series, no matter its tone or genre, has a token beach episode, and that's not far from the truth. Many slice-of-life series taking place in Japan, have a beach episode, such as Don't Toy With Me, Ms. Nagatoro!. They also appear in more action-oriented series such as My Hero Academia or even DARLING in the FRANXX, both of which have their own beach episodes, not to mention countless rom-com anime series. The question isn't whether a certain genre has the right context for a beach episode -- the question is whether the episode contributes to the plot and feels like an organic part of the story, rather than an obligatory side quest. That can give Shield Hero's own beach episode some context. An example of beach episodes done wrong is the token beach sequence in My Hero Academia season 5, featuring Ochaco, Tsuyu, Nejire, and Sirius filling an uneventful afternoon at the beach just because they could, and the entire scene was widely recognized as the filler that it was. In fact, the entire episode was filler, but at least some of it served as an on-ramp to the World Heroes' Mission movie, while the beach sequence stuck out for being totally unnecessary. Slice-of-life and rom-com anime series make moderate use of beach episodes, such as My Senpai is Annoying and Nisekoi, advancing character relationships and personal arcs by token amounts at a sunny beach. The character progression could have happened in any setting, but at the beach, characters may feel relaxed and uninhibited, which can help them open up and move the plot along. Still, some series might go too far out of their way to visit the beach just because they can. In that context, Shield Hero's own beach scene stands out as one of anime's best in recent years, since it spent little to no time on gratuitous fan service or beach cliches such as burying someone up to their neck or playing beach volleyball. Instead, Shield Hero's beach sequence e soon became a fresh and exciting battlefield for the next Wave, and the good times lasted just long enough to give Naofumi a much-needed break before diving back into the action. More anime series could stand to follow this example.

That can give Shield Hero's own beach episode some context. An example of beach episodes done wrong is the token beach sequence in My Hero Academia season 5, featuring Ochaco, Tsuyu, Nejire, and Sirius filling an uneventful afternoon at the beach just because they could, and the entire scene was widely recognized as the filler that it was. In fact, the entire episode was filler, but at least some of it served as an on-ramp to the World Heroes' Mission movie, while the beach sequence stuck out for being totally unnecessary. Slice-of-life and rom-com anime series make moderate use of beach episodes, such as My Senpai is Annoying and Nisekoi, advancing character relationships and personal arcs by token amounts at a sunny beach. The character progression could have happened in any setting, but at the beach, characters may feel relaxed and uninhibited, which can help them open up and move the plot along. Still, some series might go too far out of their way to visit the beach just because they can. In that context, Shield Hero's own beach scene stands out as one of anime's best in recent years, since it spent little to no time on gratuitous fan service or beach cliches such as burying someone up to their neck or playing beach volleyball. Instead, Shield Hero's beach sequence e soon became a fresh and exciting battlefield for the next Wave, and the good times lasted just long enough to give Naofumi a much-needed break before diving back into the action. More anime series could stand to follow this example.

What Will Yangchen's Novel Reveal About The Avatar Before Her? The Dawn of Yangchen novel will follow the Avatar's rise to becoming a legend, but she needs to do that in Avatar Szeto's shadow.     By Brenton Stewart Published 3 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Avatar: The Last Airbender depicted Aang's struggles saving the world from the challenges the previous Avatars created, and ever since then, it has been a theme in the franchise to show how every Avatar responds to the legacy of their predecessors. In the prequel novels The Rise of Kyoshi and The Shadow of Kyoshi, this proved truer than ever, as Kyoshi not only had to deal with the problems of Kuruk's time but also meet the legendary standard that Yangchen set before her. In The Dawn of Yangchen, the cycle will continue as the prequel novel explores Yangchen's own challenges in living up to her predecessor, Avatar Szeto. But just what do we know about Szeto's legacy, and what might that mean for Yangchen's journey?  RELATED: Avatar Roku's Waterbending Master May Be the Greatest Waterbender of All Time                  Much of Yangchen's life is largely a mystery in the Avatar franchise, as she was seldom seen in the original series. Luckily, the novels and comics provide more detail about her life, fleshing out Yangchen as a legendary figure who navigated international tensions with such diplomacy that she kept the world safe from war even past her own lifetime. The comic The Rift even delves into a conflict she had with the spirit General Old Iron shortly after she mastered the four elements. However, judging by The Dawn of Yangchen's synopsis, much of the story will take place around or even before the earlier days of her career. The synopsis for the novel emphasizes Yangchen's inexperience during its setting and her growth into her role as Avatar in stark contrast to her predecessor Szeto. It sets up a story in which Yangchen's struggles with Earth Kingdom politics and the threat of a weapon of mass destruction threaten the stability of the world, but from what we know of Szeto's time, such political machinations were the Fire Avatar's forte. RELATED: Stunning Avatar Fan Art Spotlights Aang's Cutest Companion The Shadow of Kyoshi established that Szeto was a wise and tactical Avatar whose primary accomplishments resulted from his mastery of bureaucracy as much as the four elements. Rising through the ranks of the Fire Nation's political infrastructure, Szeto became the Grand Advisor to Fire Lord Ysor. With a shrewd sense of accounting and diplomacy, he managed to unify the Fire Nation government during a time of great strife and hardship from natural disasters, making him a revered figure even generations after his death. However, what's most notable about what we know of Szeto's life is how little of it seemed to hold influence over the rest of the world. Although Szeto is widely celebrated in the Fire Nation, there is little to nothing in the canon about his influence on the political stability in the other Four Nations. While he was undoubtedly a powerful bender, seen in a flashback erupting multiple volcanos while in the Avatar State, it seems that what Yangchen may have to deal with primarily are his failings to balance the rest of the world while tending to his own nation. RELATED: Avatar Legends: What Was Wan Shi Tong's Library Like Before Aang?                  Indeed, the Earth Kingdom proved to be rife with corruption and conflict by the Era of Kyoshi two cycles later, and the problems there were so deeply entrenched that they remained even in the days of following Avatars like Roku, Aang and Korra. This could mean that the inexperienced Yangchen is in over her head where the Earth Kingdom's crown is concerned. Given that the Air Nomad survives the conflicts of her time and manages to succeed where Szeto failed, this stands out as one of the most intriguing elements of the upcoming novel that fans should anticipate. Indeed, Yangchen's own failings were already explored in the prior Kyoshi novels. Every good story needs a good conflict, after all, and it appears that Yangchen will have no shortage of those in the days before she became the myth that would last for generations.

The synopsis for the novel emphasizes Yangchen's inexperience during its setting and her growth into her role as Avatar in stark contrast to her predecessor Szeto. It sets up a story in which Yangchen's struggles with Earth Kingdom politics and the threat of a weapon of mass destruction threaten the stability of the world, but from what we know of Szeto's time, such political machinations were the Fire Avatar's forte. RELATED: Stunning Avatar Fan Art Spotlights Aang's Cutest Companion The Shadow of Kyoshi established that Szeto was a wise and tactical Avatar whose primary accomplishments resulted from his mastery of bureaucracy as much as the four elements. Rising through the ranks of the Fire Nation's political infrastructure, Szeto became the Grand Advisor to Fire Lord Ysor. With a shrewd sense of accounting and diplomacy, he managed to unify the Fire Nation government during a time of great strife and hardship from natural disasters, making him a revered figure even generations after his death. However, what's most notable about what we know of Szeto's life is how little of it seemed to hold influence over the rest of the world. Although Szeto is widely celebrated in the Fire Nation, there is little to nothing in the canon about his influence on the political stability in the other Four Nations. While he was undoubtedly a powerful bender, seen in a flashback erupting multiple volcanos while in the Avatar State, it seems that what Yangchen may have to deal with primarily are his failings to balance the rest of the world while tending to his own nation. RELATED: Avatar Legends: What Was Wan Shi Tong's Library Like Before Aang?                  Indeed, the Earth Kingdom proved to be rife with corruption and conflict by the Era of Kyoshi two cycles later, and the problems there were so deeply entrenched that they remained even in the days of following Avatars like Roku, Aang and Korra. This could mean that the inexperienced Yangchen is in over her head where the Earth Kingdom's crown is concerned. Given that the Air Nomad survives the conflicts of her time and manages to succeed where Szeto failed, this stands out as one of the most intriguing elements of the upcoming novel that fans should anticipate. Indeed, Yangchen's own failings were already explored in the prior Kyoshi novels. Every good story needs a good conflict, after all, and it appears that Yangchen will have no shortage of those in the days before she became the myth that would last for generations.

By Louis Kemner Published 21 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Science Fell in Love So I Tried to Prove It is a charming rom-com anime series that is due to return in the Spring 2022 anime season, and anime fans stand to learn a lot from this charming edutainment anime series. Similar to Dr. Stone and Cells at Work!, this anime can entertain viewers with charming characters and skits while also teaching them real-life science. Protagonists Yukimura Shinya and Himuro Ayame both use real-life science to explain their experiments in the world of love, and they are happy to explain the inner workings of their theories and methods during an episode. To back them up, there's also the bonus character Rikekuma the science bear, a talking teddy bear who goes in-depth on a variety of topics in between scenes.  RELATED: The Best Rom-Com Anime to Watch After Horimiya The Role Of Rikekuma The Science Bear                  Rikekuma the science bear isn't a proper character in the series -- that is, Rikekuma never interacts with anyone else in the main cast of Science Fell in Love, and none of the main characters even acknowledge or seem to be aware of Rikekuma at all. Instead, this talking teddy bear is more like a mascot for the series who appears in between scenes to deliver lectures that would interrupt the pacing of an actual scene in Science Fell in Love. Rikekuma's main job is to deliver concise, detailed lectures on topics such as margins of error and the ""traveling salesman"" problem when the main characters cannot, and give Science Fell in Love fans more context for what Ayame and Shinya are talking about. Rikekuma, however, doesn't seem too thrilled with any of this. Amusingly, this bonus character usually seems to be in a bad mood, and Rikekuma seems to scorn humans for their sloppy and careless ways. Rikekuma usually delivers its lectures with an air of impatience and reluctance, which creates contrast with the charming and easygoing main characters, who are more interested in doki-doki heart rates and kissing than lecturing anyone. Rikekuma is a foil to the lovestruck Ayame and her kuudere lab partner Shinya, which helps provide balance in the series and keep it more grounded with a new perspective. Ayame often has her head in the clouds, so the grouchy Rikekuma is there to keep the anime's tone in check, and deliver some hard science all the while. Oddly, Rikekuma has an adorable appearance as a talking teddy bear in glasses, and it might even dress up during its lectures, unaware of how much it can charm viewers despite its attitude. There's no character quite like Rikekuma the science bear. RELATED: This Shojo-Based Anime Series is Survival Sci-Fi Done Right Rikekuma's Best Science Lectures In The Anime                  Rikekuma the science bear appears in several episodes of Science Fell in Love and expanded upon a variety of intriguing topics without sounding too dry about it. One of Rikekuma's most memorable lectures involves the ""traveling salesman"" problem, a scenario describing how a single party can visit a set number of cities once each while traveling the shortest possible distance before returning to the original city. This scenario is a matter of optimizing a vast set of data where many combinations or routes for a solution may exist. In some cases, it may be hopelessly difficult to find the truly optimal route, so a scientist or researcher may have to make do with a moderately efficient route, and sacrifice the possibility of the ""perfect"" route. In many fields of research, only the most accurate, efficient, and relevant data is desired, but even scientists have their limits, and in some scenarios, finding the ""perfect"" route simply won't happen. In Science Fell in Love, for example, Shinya and Ayame went on a date and intended to visit every attraction at the amusement park in the most efficient manner to keep their schedule, but that's easier said than done. Rikekuma also delivered a lecture about the benefits of rounding, since many numbers in a scientific experiment or math problem are irrational numbers, with a patternless series of numbers stretching infinitely, such as 7.5827908264023148... and so on. Not even the most detail-oriented scientist would attempt a calculation with numbers like that, so scientists tend to round to a certain decimal place, such as the thousandths place. The irrational number given earlier, for example, could be rounded to 7.583, since the ""7"" after the ""2"" causes the 2 to become a 3, as the numbers 5-9 cause the previous one to go up. Then, during the amusement park sequence in Science Fell in Love Episode 4, Rikekuma explained now ""normalization"" works when working with data. In that episode, Shinya and Ayame wanted to calculate which new pair of shoes was the optimal one to buy, with price being just one of several factors, along with fashion sense, functionality, and base preference. These factors and more can be measured in different ways or not at all, so it's important for the researcher to treat each factor the same way so they can be calculated together -- in this case, every factor for the shoes was given a value out of 100. Otherwise, the calculations would be a case of ""apples to oranges.""

By Jonathon Greenall Published 5 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Hatsune Miku is an icon. First launched in 2007, the anthropomorphic representation of the popular Vocaloid voicebank has become a massive and recognized star worldwide. The character has since appeared in countless video games, anime series and other media. It was also recently confirmed that Miku will appear in a special crossover series called Dropkick on My Devil! X Mame Anime, which will promote the island of Hokkaido. However, this isn't Hatsune Miku's first anime appearance -- nor is it the weirdest. In 2018, Hatsune Miku appeared in an anime called Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion. This train-based mecha series, created by Takara Tomy and Japan Railways Group, follows a young boy who loves trains named Hayato Hayasugi. One day, Hayato learns his father is secretly working for the Shinkansen Ultra Evolution Institute, a secretive organization that creates Shinkalions to fight monsters that try to attack Japan. The boy turns out to have an aptitude for piloting Shinkalions and becomes the pilot of the Shinkalion E5 Hayabusa.  Related: Gundam's Iron-Blooded Orphans Spinoff Trailer Introduces a Slew of New Characters and Mecha                  Miku appears in the anime's 15th episode, ""Go North!! Shinkalion H5 Hayabusa."" Hayato and his friends realize their mysterious foe is planning to spread panic by revealing monsters to the world, and they're soon proved right when one attacks Hakodate in Hokkaido. The pilots dive into their Shinkalions and head there to fight, but realize they're not going to make it in time. However, before the plan can come to fruition, another Shinkalion enters the fray. Hayato and his friends are initially confused when they learn the pilot is a girl with distinctive blue twin tails and a robotic voice. This girl holds the monster off, eventually destroying it with her robot's finishing move. After the battle, she introduces herself as Hatsune Miku. However, this Miku differs a little from her usual forms found in other media. Here, she is an eleven-year-old girl who wants to become a Shinkalion driver but is held back by motion sickness. When Hayato falls ill, Miku once again must dive into battle in her Shinkalion, proving herself as a pilot. Shinkalion's Miku lore is full of references to the original Vocaloid. The character is voiced by Saki Fujita, the actress whose voice is the basis for the singer's voicebank. Her age of 11 references the fact that the Miku voicebank was 11 years old at the time of the episode's release. Her being based at the Shinkansen Ultra Evolution Institute's Hokkaido Branch references the headquarters of Crypton Future Media -- the company behind the Miku voicebank. Related: Rising of the Shield Hero and Bofuri Collide in Isekai Crossover Promotion                  However, this isn't Miku's only appearance in the franchise. She would show up several times during the series and also appears in the movie Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion the Movie: The Marvelous Fast ALFA-X That Comes From the Future. This film reveals that in the time since the end of the original series, Miku has become a singer just like her Vocaloid counterpart. Her appearance here also means she has fought against a form of Godzilla and fought alongside Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion, further proving that Shinkalion is home to some of anime's most unexpected crossovers. Dropkick On My Devil will not be the last time Miku is seen in an anime. She's become such a part of anime fan culture that she'll inevitably make another crossover or cameo appearance. However, it will be hard to top her Shinkalion role for pure weirdness, especially as the anime made Miku a unique character in its own universe while paying tribute to the original Vocaloid. This cameo also tops the oddity charts because it means that Miku has technically crossed over with loads of other franchises due to Shinkalion's own number of cameos and crossovers.

By Louis Kemner Published 8 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Love of Kill Episode 12, ""My Name,"" now streaming on Crunchyroll. In previous episodes of Love of Kill, the haunted heroine Chateau Dankworth recalled her violent past with the original Ryang-Ha Song and his mysterious imposter, and flashbacks finally shed some light on how she and the two of them are connected. Now in the Season 1 finale, Chateau must do something about the strained emotions inside her. Chateau and the new Ryang-Ha are currently hiding from the vicious Mr. Donny and his young assassins, but she's not in the clear just yet. She cannot bear the guilt of having shot the original Ryang-Ha in a moment of panic but the new one is here to help, and the two unlikely allies may find a way to move on from the past and face the future together.  RELATED: Platinum End: Was it Muni Who Plotted to [SPOILER] Heaven?                  Ryang-Ha brings Chateau to one of his safe houses in the attic of a small apartment. There she awakens from many hours of sleep, with her troubled past still on her mind. She admits to remembering everything about the fateful night when she shot the original Ryang-Ha by accident, and admits these memories are why she cannot push her yandere-style lover away in the present day. Chateau and the new Ryang-Ha have a strong connection thanks to the original's sacrifice, and Episode 12 makes it clear that this bond is more wholesome than Ryang-Ha's earlier antics might have suggested. Earlier in Love of Kill, the current Ryang-Ha was an obnoxious yandere who pestered Chateau nonstop as her self-appointed guardian. She simply couldn't get rid of this pest, even aboard the Artemisia cruise ship. At the time, it wasn't clear if Ryang-Ha was acting out of genuine affection or jealous self-interest, and his mysterious background didn't help. Now, recent episodes assure viewers that Ryang-Ha always truly had Chateau's best interests at heart. The guardian feels responsible for Chateau after the original Ryang-Ha Song's death, and protecting her after all these years is his way of paying tribute to the original's memory. In the present day, Chateau understands and accepts this, and once she processes her guilt, she and Ryang-Ha get ready for the next step. RELATED: The Strongest Sage's Final Episode Leaves a Lot to be Desired                  Once Chateau finishes working through her difficult emotions, she settles down and helps Ryang-Ha clean up the dusty safe house -- and requests to formally hire him as her agent. He refuses to be paid any money, however, and specifies that he wants something different from her. Chateau is stumped, but he's most likely asking for her genuine affection, possibly as his girlfriend. Ryang-Ha has been an obnoxious but well-meaning Mr. Romance since the start in Love of Kill, and with everything quiet again, he has the chance to express that side of him once more. He's enamored with Chateau, allowing the shojo side of this seinen-style thriller series to shine forth. The two of them may actually become a couple in a possible Season 2, or at least take the first steps in that direction. There's no longer anyone or anything to get in the way. As Season 1 concludes, Chateau and Ryang-Ha are on the roof when a helicopter arrives and they whip out their pistols, ready for action. By now, they both have a deeper and more respectful understanding of one another and their relationship. Chateau accepts Ryang-Ha as her lovestruck bodyguard while he acknowledges her as his true equal and partner, and not just someone who needs protection. Despite being the shojo heroine since the start, Chateau relied heavily on Ryang-Ha and other characters for survival and purpose. Now she has truly blossomed, and Ryang-Ha is clearly happy for her. They can face the future and its dangers side by side as co-stars of the winter anime season's bloodiest shojo adventure.

By Patrick Morris Published 20 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    School-based anime have a tendency toward the grandiose, both aesthetically and narratively. All too often, the characters are hyper-attractive, super-powered members of the social elite who never seem to go to class. Additionally, many high school series incorporate a student ranking system that -- while tremendously fun -- is silly to the extreme. A famous example is the contemporary cult classic Kakegurui. The students of Kakegurui are ranked according to how many games of chance they win. The more frequently -- and the more money -- students win, the further they advance in the school's rankings. This means that students who lose and fall into debt descend in the rankings, and are consequently treated as slaves to the student body. Preposterous as that sounds, there's one preceding series with a ranking system that's even more ridiculous.  RELATED: Why Does Kakegurui Make Gambling So Erotic?                  2010's Baka and Test is a short, spitfire parody series that pulls no punches. The title is rife with wacky, madcap humor, characters that feel simultaneously accessible and entertaining and enough nosebleeds to make even High School DxD characters roll their eyes. Baka and Test also utilizes an interesting, integral student ranking system that's as bonkers as it is brilliant. The series takes place in the fictional Fumizuki Preparatory Academy. Immediately following their entrance exams, students are sorted into one of six classes between A and F. Students in the top-ranking A class are awarded significant perks, such as a snack bar, luxuriously furnished air-conditioned classrooms and school-issued laptops. Those relegated to class F are provided with the shabbiest classrooms, low (often broken) wooden tables for desks and flat, weathered cushions for seats. However, it's possible for low-rank classes to earn access to the special incentives given to their high-ranking counterparts. RELATED: Why Jujutsu Kaisen's Itadori Yuji Should Have Gone to This Anime School Instead                  Fumizuki Academy has a unique system in place wherein students may conjure Summoned Beings, or ""Avatars."" With the approval of a teacher, these Summoned Beings are permitted to do battle with one another. A principal caveat to these battles is that the strength of the students' Summoned Beings is determined by the students' most recent score in the presiding teacher's subject. So, if the Classical Japanese teacher has approved a battle, the engaging Beings' strengths will be based on the most recent Classical Japanese test scores of their respective students. During a battle, Summoned Beings lose points as they are struck. If a Being loses all of its points, the student commanding it must take a remedial class taught by the stern-faced instructor Nishimura Soichi. If a student has done well and routinely studies -- like the series' female lead Himeji Mizuki -- their Summoned Being is more likely to be strong. However, if a student is (to put it politely) not a great test-taker -- like the lazy, half-witted male lead Yoshii Akihisa -- they're going to have trouble advancing not only academically but also socially. RELATED: Disney+'s First Exclusive Anime, Summer Time Rendering, Debuts Trailer                  Fumizuki Academy's battle system is primarily used in what's known as the Summoner Test War. During a Summoner Test War, two entire classes fight in a melee-style battle against one another. A Test War is concluded only when a class's Representative -- the highest-ranking individual within a class -- has been defeated. Should a low-ranking class prove victorious over one of the higher-ranking classes, they earn the opportunity to upgrade their classroom and equipment, as well as gain access to the other extemporaneous perks, such as vending machines or the snack bar. As ludicrous as Baka and Test's ranking system is, it has something pivotal working in its favor: it is inextricably linked to academics. Most school-based anime -- and Kakegurui is no exception -- keep education on the periphery, if they address it at all (seriously, how many scenes from Kakegurui actually take place during class?). Baka and Test takes a more refreshing track, opting to keep the value of quality education at the forefront of the narrative. True, the core cast is mainly studying so hard to take advantage of the benefits afforded to high-ranking classes, but they are still learning. The characters are depicted attending classes, doing homework and studying -- a shockingly rare quality among high school series. Although parodic in its execution, Baka and Test does the truly innovative and returns the high school series to the classroom, giving audiences plenty to consider in the process.

Similar to the streaming company's release schedule to the new season of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, new episodes of the show are being released intermittently in batches. The last group of new episodes premiered in January; Netflix has yet to announce when it will release further chapters of the show internationally. The Pokémon anime is currently celebrating the 25th anniversary of its original premiere. The first episode of the series first debuted on April 1, 1997, a little more than a year after Game Freak and Nintendo released Pocket Monsters: Red and Green Version for the original black-and-white Game Boy in Japan on Feb. 27, 1996. While a year separated the premiere of the anime from the release of the original games in Japan, the TV show premiered in North America just a month after Nintendo released the original games, now localized under the title Pokémon Red and Blue Versions, in 1998. RELATED: Pokémon TCG Online Is a Great Way for New Players to Learn the Basics The celebration of the anime's big anniversary comes after The Pokémon Company wrapped up its year-long celebration 25th anniversary of the video game series. Nintendo and Game Freak released numerous new titles in the series throughout 2021, including Pokémon Unite, a free-to-play MOBA-style competitive game and Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, a 3D remake of the main series' original pair of DS games. The Pokémon Company recently showed off the future of the series in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, which will kick off the series' ninth generation of games. The Pokémon anime has always tried to tie itself in with the latest releases in the video game series, so its possible that Master Journeys'  anniversary-inspired adventures through past regions may soon end as Ash and Pikachu move on to the latest games' Spain-inspired region. Scarlet and Violet are currently scheduled to be released for the Nintendo Switch sometime before the end of 2022.

By Michael Lacerna Published 1 day ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Pokémon Master Journeys released a new trailer and key visual for the series' next batch of episodes. The new previews suggest that Ash, Goh and Chloe will get closer to achieving their Pokémon-related goals in the series' next arc. Ash is shown reuniting with his beloved Greninja and continuing to hone his skills in preparation for his eventual showdown with the champion of the World Coronation Series, Leon, while Goh encounters the legendary Pokémon Suicune, and Chloe participates in a Pokémon contest with her still un-evolved Evee. A new poster also teases an encounter with Mew, the rare Pokémon that Goh wants to capture most of all.

Similar to the streaming company's release schedule to the new season of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, new episodes of the show are being released intermittently in batches. The last group of new episodes premiered in January; Netflix has yet to announce when it will release further chapters of the show internationally. The Pokémon anime is currently celebrating the 25th anniversary of its original premiere. The first episode of the series first debuted on April 1, 1997, a little more than a year after Game Freak and Nintendo released Pocket Monsters: Red and Green Version for the original black-and-white Game Boy in Japan on Feb. 27, 1996. While a year separated the premiere of the anime from the release of the original games in Japan, the TV show premiered in North America just a month after Nintendo released the original games, now localized under the title Pokémon Red and Blue Versions, in 1998. RELATED: Pokémon TCG Online Is a Great Way for New Players to Learn the Basics The celebration of the anime's big anniversary comes after The Pokémon Company wrapped up its year-long celebration 25th anniversary of the video game series. Nintendo and Game Freak released numerous new titles in the series throughout 2021, including Pokémon Unite, a free-to-play MOBA-style competitive game and Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, a 3D remake of the main series' original pair of DS games. The Pokémon Company recently showed off the future of the series in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, which will kick off the series' ninth generation of games. The Pokémon anime has always tried to tie itself in with the latest releases in the video game series, so its possible that Master Journeys'  anniversary-inspired adventures through past regions may soon end as Ash and Pikachu move on to the latest games' Spain-inspired region. Scarlet and Violet are currently scheduled to be released for the Nintendo Switch sometime before the end of 2022.

By Gregory Segal Published Mar 22, 2022      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Since Platinum End is drawing to a close, it seems like a better time than any to reflect on its main character, Mirai Kakehashi. While many anime viewers have become fans of the show, particularly in light of its unconventional story, the popularity of its protagonist has been far less considerable. Mirai has often been frustrating to watch. He has repeatedly been unable to make important decisions or have the initiative to express his own ideas. While this character's lack of confidence as a God candidate is understandable in light of his age and traumatic past, his passive nature hasn’t exactly led to the most entertaining or endearing moments.  RELATED: How Boruto Paid Homage to Naruto & Sasuke's Most Explosive Moment                  As a young child, Mirai lived a happy existence with his parents and younger brother. However, at the age of seven, his family was all killed in an apparent accident, which resulted in him being taken in by his relatives. Throughout this period, he was treated poorly, receiving both physical and mental abuse from his father’s sister, her husband and their children. Shortly after meeting Nasse, a special-rank angel, it’s revealed that the death of Mirai’s family was planned by his aunt and uncle in an effort to get their money. Once Mirai is granted access to a pair of wings, a red arrow that can make anyone fall in love with him and a white arrow that can kill any person instantly, he remains determined that he will not use them not to gain wealth or power, but instead true happiness. Consequently, Mirai vows that he will not use his white arrow to kill anyone, as this would go against his goals and be morally unjust. RELATED: Platinum End: Professor Yoneda & Shuji Finally Learn Shonen's Most Vital Lesson This framework goes to some lengths to create a more relatable character. Mirai isn’t completely overpowered, he considers the consequences of his actions and he's afraid of the world around him. This establishes a more realistic dynamic that is often not as seen within mainstream anime, in which a young protagonist is actively aware that they are both naive and vulnerable. Unfortunately, the strictness to which Mirai follows his ethical code goes a little too far. His no-kill policy often leads those around him to get in harm's way and has almost brought humanity to the point of destruction. While it's clear that the creators of the show were attempting to disrupt the anime convention of what it means to be a main character, it has only led Mirai to become more two-dimensional. RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling's Gojo Is Still Afraid to Take the Next Step                  Both people and the decisions they make are not black and white. While life would certainly be a lot easier if this was the case, it simply isn’t. Although Mirai eventually recognizes this (to a degree) and manages to use his white arrow to defend himself against Dr. Yoneda, it all feels too little too late. This character's inability to change his stance ends up being more annoying than it is admirable. While subverting the trope of the action-driven hero is all well and good in theory, in practice, it results in the mundane. Mirai runs, hides or attempts to talk his way out of the majority of challenges that he faces. Although it isn’t surprising that a 15-year-old boy would react in this way, it doesn’t necessarily mean that this creates a well-constructed story or character arc. RELATED: This Shojo-Based Anime Series Is Survival Sci-Fi Done Right  When Mirai eventually gets the courage to take on his opponents, it only makes it more disappointing to know that he will likely not do anything to combat them effectively. Instead, the viewer considers what scenario or person will come to the rescue and allow Mirai to escape unscathed. Although Mirai’s moral code might have worked for a character in another series, the nature of the God candidate's powers means that there is very little he can do to hold to this commitment without passing the buck. Having said this, Mirai was an interesting experiment into how an anime protagonist can be portrayed in a story that would usually be considered as part of the fantasy-action genre. While the result may not have been ideal, it's good to see that writers are challenging conventions by creating characters that don’t fit the expected mold. Nonetheless, Mirai’s strong convictions and apathetic attitude ended up limiting what his character could do and where the story might have progressed. If the creators of Platinum End were to have combined their unconventional story with a more approachable character, the series might have ended up being an even greater success than it has been to date.

Is Attack on Titan's Upcoming Episode Really the Finale? The last episode of the season, and perhaps the series as a whole, is just around the corner. But with so much unresolved, how will it wrap things up?     By Chris Nishijima Published 1 day ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4 - The Final Season: Part 2, now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll. The world-shaking anime adaptation of Hajime Isayama's Attack on Titan is finally heading toward its conclusion. Its current set of episodes has left viewers questioning everything that they know about the series, from the nature of the world that the Eldians inhabit to the motivations of the show's most central character. However, even with so many questions hanging in the air, one puzzle in particular seems to be plaguing audiences -- is episode 87, which is set to debut within the next few days, really the conclusion of the television anime?  RELATED: Attack on Titan: The Scouts Found Their New Sniper                  At first glance, the answer to this query seems relatively straightforward. Prior to the premiere of the ongoing run, the series' studio MAPPA listed Season 4, Part 2 as consisting of 12 episodes. Furthermore, while many widely popular shows like Demon Slayer have made use of extra-long episodes to either conclude or kick off storylines, as they did in the most recent ""Entertainment District"" arc, this does not appear to be the case with Attack on Titan. Although there has been no such denial of an elongated finale from any official source, discussion online has pointed to Japanese television guides to corroborate the standard 25-minute timeslot. Streaming service Crunchyroll even hyped up the upcoming episode as the finale, releasing a special teaser trailer leaning into the tension of the upcoming fight to stop Eren from annihilating the outside world.                  Nevertheless, the apocalypse-level struggle between Eren and his former comrades seems to warrant far more screentime than a single episode can provide. This is especially true because the episode's title, ""Dawn of Humanity,"" correlates with a manga chapter of the same name -- one that has nine chapters of content after it. Since the show's most recent season has maintained a pace of one chapter per episode, squeezing ten full chapters into a single episode would be a massive shift in pace, no matter how long said episode is. RELATED: How Would Attack on Titan Have Changed If Erwin Became the Colossal Titan? This has led fans to speculate about the possibility that rather than conclude the anime on television, MAPPA could be planning to finish things off with a movie instead. Recent box office hits like Jujutsu Kaisen 0 and Demon Slayer: Mugen Train have proven that anime films related to ongoing series can be just as lucrative as any other feature. That being said, neither of these two served as series finales, with the former being a prequel and the latter depicting a mid-season arc.                  While there have been movies that were released after the closing of their anime series, these have typically resembled epilogues, side stories or teases for potential continuations, such as The Last: Naruto the Movie or Puella Magi Madoka Magica: The Movie - Rebellion. Utilizing a movie as the true ending of a series would be fairly unprecedented, with the exception of features such as The End of Evangelion -- although even that was more of an alternate version of the televised ending rather than the definitive final act. RELATED: Attack on Titan Theory: Zeke's Spinal Fluid Led to [SPOILER's] Unique Transformation Another possibility is that MAPPA is planning on extending their so-called ""Final Season"" once more into a third part. This might sound like a somewhat misleading ploy at stringing viewers along, but it wouldn't be entirely surprising either. During the initial airing of Season 1, Part 1, there was little mention that the ""Final Season"" would be broken up into segments that would air a little over a year apart from each other. The remaining number of chapters could easily be enough to constitute a Part 3 on their own, especially if they include extended fight scenes and afterword material.                  Whatever the resolution may be, Episode 87 is currently expected to be the final episode, at least as far as Season 4, Part 2 is concerned. Regardless of any further announcement of a continuation or decision to wrap it all up in one go, there is no word on there being more to Attack on Titan in the foreseeable future. Still, MAPPA has done an excellent job of adapting the series thus far, giving each chapter the attention and time it needs to shine. One can only hope that this upcoming episode, whatever it may be, will be treated in the same way.

Naruto: What Is Haku's Gender? Though the gender of Haku in the early chapters of Naruto may seem ambiguous, there's a firm answer given about the youth in the anime and manga.     By Timothy Donohoo Published Mar 24, 2022      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    As the story of Naruto developed, more and more now-classic characters were introduced. These include the bushy-browed Rock Lee, as well as the villainous Orochimaru. One character who was brought in and quickly gotten rid of, however, was Haku. This underling of Zabuza was part of one of the franchise's earlier arcs, but many fans continue to ask about the mysterious Haku's gender. Haku is incredibly soft-spoken, and due to the character's appearance, even Naruto isn't sure what to make of the situation. Despite this confusion, the gender of Haku is indeed clearly stated in the manga and anime. Here's which sex the young ninja belongs to.  RELATED: What Exactly Is Naruto's 'Springtime of Youth'? What Is Haku's Gender In Naruto?                  The ""Prologue - Land of Waves"" arc was one of the earliest in Naruto, directly preceding the Chunin Exams. The central villain of this saga was Zabuza, a ninja who wielded a gigantic sword. Serving alongside him was the much more diminutive Haku, who also had a much less obviously masculine design. Thanks to this, combined with a soft voice and kimono, many erroneously assume that Haku is female.

He makes this plain to Naruto, who then states his aforementioned attraction to the lad.

RELATED: How Boruto Paid Homage to Naruto & Sasuke's Most Explosive Moment What Is Haku's Origin in Naruto?

An example of this includes the classic Rasengan and Sharingan attacks. The ensuing conflict led to the death of Haku's parents, with the orphan thereafter staying with the wayward Zabuza. There's nothing about this origin that really explains why Haku is so feminine in appearance or voice. This is accentuated by some of the clothing he wears, which is vibrant and pink. To be fair, softer features and voices would definitely be more common in the East for men, especially for someone as young as Haku. Sadly, he didn't live much longer after Naruto met him, dying to defend his friend Zabuza. They were both later revived by Kabuto, though these were mindless zombies without the personality of who they once were.

Though the gender of Haku in the early chapters of Naruto may seem ambiguous, there's a firm answer given about the youth in the anime and manga.     By Timothy Donohoo Published Mar 24, 2022      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    As the story of Naruto developed, more and more now-classic characters were introduced. These include the bushy-browed Rock Lee, as well as the villainous Orochimaru. One character who was brought in and quickly gotten rid of, however, was Haku. This underling of Zabuza was part of one of the franchise's earlier arcs, but many fans continue to ask about the mysterious Haku's gender. Haku is incredibly soft-spoken, and due to the character's appearance, even Naruto isn't sure what to make of the situation. Despite this confusion, the gender of Haku is indeed clearly stated in the manga and anime. Here's which sex the young ninja belongs to.  RELATED: What Exactly Is Naruto's 'Springtime of Youth'? What Is Haku's Gender In Naruto?                  The ""Prologue - Land of Waves"" arc was one of the earliest in Naruto, directly preceding the Chunin Exams. The central villain of this saga was Zabuza, a ninja who wielded a gigantic sword. Serving alongside him was the much more diminutive Haku, who also had a much less obviously masculine design. Thanks to this, combined with a soft voice and kimono, many erroneously assume that Haku is female. Naruto even mentions this, stating that the young person he encounters is even prettier than Sakura. Haku, however, is not a young lady, but instead a young man. He makes this plain to Naruto, who then states his aforementioned attraction to the lad. From then on, any confusion as to which gender Haku is has been clarified, and he's firmly referred to as a boy for the rest of his short life.

Here's another female-led mecha anime to enjoy.     By Jonathon Greenall Published 45 minutes ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The latest announcement regarding Gundam: The Witch From Mercury has mecha anime fans everywhere excited. The idea of a Gundam series with a female lead has captured imaginations and caused many to go searching for other shows with a similar premise. However, the new Gundam isn't the first mecha anime to star a female protagonist -- the criminally overlooked Lagrange: The Flower of Rin-ne did it in 2012. Lagrange: The Flower of Rin-ne was written by Shotaro Suga, who has also done scripts for Darker than Black, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and Dimension W. The series was created by Production I.G, which also worked on Fena: Pirate Princess, while Xebec, the studio behind To Love Ru, produced the animation. Lagrange: The Flower of Rin-ne had two seasons, both of which aired throughout 2012. There was also a tie-in manga that ran from 2011-2013 in Young Gangan magazine. Here's what Lagrange is all about and why it's worth checking out while waiting for the new Gundam to arrive.  Related: Gundam: The Witch from Mercury Showcases the Franchise’s First Female Protagonist                  Lagrange: The Flower of Rin-ne follows Madoka Kyouno, a young girl who is the only member of Kamogawa Girls' High School's Jersey Club. This club aims to help anyone in need and Madoka spends her day helping out however she can. One day she meets Lan, an alien who says she is from a planet called Le Graite. Lan tells Madoka she needs her help to stop a war between Le Garite and another world called De Metrio. To help in this fight, Lan has brought Madoka a powerful robotic aircraft called a Vox Unit and informs her that she's destined to be its pilot. Madoka is initially unsure about this but when she touches the Unit, she suddenly recalls seeing the craft when she nearly drowned ten years earlier. Madoka agrees to pilot the Vox Aura and finds that the mech can seemingly react to her emotions. After this, a military organization called Novumundus informs Madoka that it will support the girls in their missions. They also reveal there is much more they need to do -- and there will be more dangers to face. Eventually Madoka teams up with Lan, who controls the Vox Rympha. The girls are soon joined by a third pilot in the form of transfer student Muginami. Taking control of the Vox Ignis, she joins the club and befriends the other girls. However, her backstory is soon revealed, showing that the story's conflict might not be as cut-and-dry as it appears. As the girls continue to encounter more combatants and go on increasingly dangerous missions, they learn there is more depth to the war and those fighting it than they initially thought. Related: How Gundam Creator Yoshiyuki Tomino's ""Aura Battler Dunbine"" Influenced Isekai                  The character dynamics in Lagrange: The Flower of Rin-ne make it stand out from other mecha anime. Madoka's idealism is uplifting but unfortunate as she is forced to confront the messy conflict she's thrown into, while Lan's struggles to adapt to Earth and a non-luxurious lifestyle show how hard it can be to integrate into a different society and culture. It also portrays how our own cultures can blind us to the struggles of others. Muginami's internal conflicts also illustrate how misunderstandings often spiral out of control and lead to disputes. Together, this trio and their supporting cast make the story feel uniquely human and provide a solid emotional core that works to make the mecha action all the more gripping and fascinating -- all while delivering some fun slice-of-life comedy. Because of this, Lagrange: The Flower of Rin-ne offers a nuanced experience while remaining light-hearted. Lagrange: The Flower of Rin-ne is a fantastic female-led mecha anime that deserves more attention. It combines several commonly-seen mecha elements, adds fun comedy and emotional drama and creates something quite unlike any other series. The cast will remain memorable long after finishing the story, making this the perfect anime to watch while waiting for Gundam: The Witch From Mercury to land. Thankfully the series is available to watch via RetroCrush, making it more accessible than ever.

By Michael Lacerna Published 22 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    A massive new Fullmetal Alchemist statue has been unveiled, but it might be one of the costliest exchanges in the series' history. Good Smile Company is now taking preorders on its new Edward and Alphonse Elric statue. The massive statue is 16 inches tall and 17 inches wide, and depicts the brothers in battle as Ed transmutes his automail arm into a dagger and Al transforms the ground to give his older sibling a boost. True to the series' law of equivalent exchange, the highly detailed and sizable figure comes with an equally hefty price tag: $2,199.99 USD. The preorder window for the statue will close on May 11, though hardcore fans will want to scrounge together the funds quickly, however, as Good Smile warns only a limited number of the statues will be produced and the preorder window may close early if orders meet the production limit.  RELATED: Fullmetal Alchemist Handles Politics Better Than Attack on Titan                                                       In order to illustrate just how large the new, non-scale statue is, Good Smile Company released an image that compares the figure to one of the company's Fullmetal Alchemist Nendoroid figures, which usually stand between 3-4 inches tall. Fullmetal Alchemist was created by celebrated manga author and artist Hiromu Arakawa in 2001. The series was one of the most popular manga series of the early '00s, achieving a global circulation of over 80 million copies. The series tells the story of two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who use their natural talent in alchemy -- the ability to transform one object into another -- to try to resurrect their beloved mother after she suddenly passes away. The attempt goes horribly awry and costs Ed an arm and a leg, while Al loses his entire body and is only able to survive by having his soul anchored to an old suit of armor. Devastated by their losses, the two brothers join their country's military force, where they work as State Alchemists as they try to find a legendary artifact that will let them undo their biggest mistake. RELATED: Fullmetal Alchemist's Promised Day Arrives in Action-Packed Live Action Trailer Arakawa's critically acclaimed manga received two anime adaptations: the first was produced in 2003, before the manga was completed, and consequently features a substantially different story line and ending. A second anime, entitled Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, premiered in 2009. The second series was a much more faithful rendition of Arakawa's original work and is now generally regarded as the superior adaptation. The series has also been adapted into a series of live-action movies, the first of which was released in 2017. The second and third entries in the trilogy are scheduled to be released in Japan later this year. Both anime series are now available for streaming on Hulu and Crunchyroll, while the manga is available in English from VIZ Media and Yen Press.

The series has already wrapped up a number of long-running plot threads, including the reveal of the traitor within UA High, and is rapidly barreling towards the final confrontation between the supervillain mastermind All for One and the current holder of One for All, Izuku ""Deku"" Midoriya, that it has been setting up for almost a decade.

Here's some of the best isekai where the main character goes home.     By Jessie Xu Published 17 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The isekai genre has exploded into popularity in recent years, leading to an oversaturation in new adaptations. The idea of the main character restarting life in a new and exciting world of fantasy is appealing to many viewers, and that demand has led to the subgenre developing its own set of tropes.  A popular trope within this subgenre is the process of the protagonist trying to find their way home. However, there are a rare few instances where they actually succeed in doing so. Here are some of the best isekai anime where the main character goes against all odds to return home. RELATED: How the Shield Hero Anime Refined the Isekai Harem Concept  Re:Creators Turns the Tables on Classic Isekai                  Starting off with an unconventional and refreshing take on the isekai genre is Re:Creators. This series challenges the conventional trope of the underdog reincarnating into a fantasy world; this time, it’s the characters from fictional worlds who are out of place in the real world. Its unique concept and clever use of the reverse isekai genre make it one of the best isekai where the main characters return home.  The Devil Is a Part-Timer! Is a Gut-Busting Comedy Isekai                  Another trailblazer in this new concept of reverse isekai, like Re:Creators, is The Devil Is a Part-Timer. Taking on a more lighthearted and comedic tone, the story follows Satan as he navigates normal life as a part-time fast-food restaurant worker while trying to find his way back to hell. This anime combines comedic relief with epic fight scenes in a way that is not over the top, contributing to its worldwide popularity. RELATED: How 'A Realist Hero' Struggles Against Isekai Fantasy Cliches  Sword Art Online: The Famous (Or Infamous) Isekai Classic                  Hailed as the series that catapulted isekai into popularity -- for better or for worse -- Sword Art Online has made a permanent mark in anime history. It would be a sin to not include this long-time classic. When a virtual reality game becomes a deathtrap for the millions of players logged on, there is only one thought pushing protagonists Kirito and Asuna forward: the hope of returning home. RELATED: How Sword Art Online: Progressive Differs From the Original Light Novels Dog Days Is the Underdog of the Isekai Genre                  Dog Days may not be the best-known isekai among the wider anime community, but it is certainly unique. This story follows the adventures of Cinque Izumi and his friends when they are invited to represent different kingdoms on an alternate Earth. The inhabitants are human-like beings with animal characteristics who fight wars through sporting competitions.  This lighthearted adaptation takes a peaceful approach toward the age-old question about the main character’s home. Protagonists are able to easily cross between both worlds, eliminating the dilemma entirely. RELATED: The Best Isekai With OP Main Characters Inuyasha Is the Classic Shoujo Isekai Fantasy                  Inuyasha has long since cemented itself as a classic shoujo series within the anime community. It tells of a classic love story across worlds and time periods between Kagome, a girl tasked with saving the world, and Inuyasha, a hybrid dog demon/human tasked with protecting her -- all while weaving a tasteful combination of comedy and romance. At first Kagome is able to easily cross between both worlds, but ultimately she'll have to make a decision between the two. RELATED: Yashahime Tackles the Morality of Humans and Demons Digimon Adventure Is a Trip Down Memory Lane                  The Digimon franchise has become one of the best-known anime franchises geared toward children along with classics like Pokemon. Taichi Yagami and his friends are suddenly transported to a ‘Digital World’ while at summer camp. Follow their exciting adventures as they journey to find their way home alongside strange creatures known as Digimon.

03-04-2022,anime,7,0,https://www.cbr.com/isekai-main-character-returns-home/,Best Isekai Where the Main Character Returns Home,"   The Best Isekai in Which the Main Character Returns Home Who wouldn’t want to return home after being transmigrated into a different world? Here's some of the best isekai where the main character goes home.     By Jessie Xu Published 17 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The isekai genre has exploded into popularity in recent years, leading to an oversaturation in new adaptations. The idea of the main character restarting life in a new and exciting world of fantasy is appealing to many viewers, and that demand has led to the subgenre developing its own set of tropes.  A popular trope within this subgenre is the process of the protagonist trying to find their way home. However, there are a rare few instances where they actually succeed in doing so. Here are some of the best isekai anime where the main character goes against all odds to return home. RELATED: How the Shield Hero Anime Refined the Isekai Harem Concept  Re:Creators Turns the Tables on Classic Isekai                  Starting off with an unconventional and refreshing take on the isekai genre is Re:Creators. This series challenges the conventional trope of the underdog reincarnating into a fantasy world; this time, it’s the characters from fictional worlds who are out of place in the real world. Its unique concept and clever use of the reverse isekai genre make it one of the best isekai where the main characters return home.  The Devil Is a Part-Timer! Is a Gut-Busting Comedy Isekai                  Another trailblazer in this new concept of reverse isekai, like Re:Creators, is The Devil Is a Part-Timer. Taking on a more lighthearted and comedic tone, the story follows Satan as he navigates normal life as a part-time fast-food restaurant worker while trying to find his way back to hell. This anime combines comedic relief with epic fight scenes in a way that is not over the top, contributing to its worldwide popularity. RELATED: How 'A Realist Hero' Struggles Against Isekai Fantasy Cliches  Sword Art Online: The Famous (Or Infamous) Isekai Classic                  Hailed as the series that catapulted isekai into popularity -- for better or for worse -- Sword Art Online has made a permanent mark in anime history. It would be a sin to not include this long-time classic. When a virtual reality game becomes a deathtrap for the millions of players logged on, there is only one thought pushing protagonists Kirito and Asuna forward: the hope of returning home. RELATED: How Sword Art Online: Progressive Differs From the Original Light Novels Dog Days Is the Underdog of the Isekai Genre                  Dog Days may not be the best-known isekai among the wider anime community, but it is certainly unique. This story follows the adventures of Cinque Izumi and his friends when they are invited to represent different kingdoms on an alternate Earth. The inhabitants are human-like beings with animal characteristics who fight wars through sporting competitions.  This lighthearted adaptation takes a peaceful approach toward the age-old question about the main character’s home. Protagonists are able to easily cross between both worlds, eliminating the dilemma entirely. RELATED: The Best Isekai With OP Main Characters Inuyasha Is the Classic Shoujo Isekai Fantasy                  Inuyasha has long since cemented itself as a classic shoujo series within the anime community. It tells of a classic love story across worlds and time periods between Kagome, a girl tasked with saving the world, and Inuyasha, a hybrid dog demon/human tasked with protecting her -- all while weaving a tasteful combination of comedy and romance. At first Kagome is able to easily cross between both worlds, but ultimately she'll have to make a decision between the two. RELATED: Yashahime Tackles the Morality of Humans and Demons Digimon Adventure Is a Trip Down Memory Lane                  The Digimon franchise has become one of the best-known anime franchises geared toward children along with classics like Pokemon. Taichi Yagami and his friends are suddenly transported to a ‘Digital World’ while at summer camp. Follow their exciting adventures as they journey to find their way home alongside strange creatures known as Digimon.

Let's dive into its differences.     By Jenelle Catherina Published 6 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Winter 2022 was quite an eventful season for anime, but nothing stood out more like My Dress-Up Darling. Equally loved for the adorable romance between the main characters Gojo and Marin and critiqued for the over-the-top and excessive fanservice, this anime has had fans talking since Episode 1. Now that the final episode of Season 1 has aired, it has been critically acclaimed as a pretty true-to-manga adaptation. Still, nothing is ever perfect, and there are some small changes within the anime -- so what changed exactly from the manga to the anime? RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling’s Pervasive Fan Service Undermines a Positive Message  The first change occurs right away in the opening of Episode 1. In the anime, we see a young Gojo looking up and admiring his grandfather's doll, mesmerized by its beauty. In the manga, there's no sign here of a young Gojo, just a younger version of his grandfather telling an off-panel Gojo about how he too can make dolls one day, before abruptly showing the traumatic moment in his childhood where his former friend disowns him for his ""feminine"" hobby. Obviously, this is only a minor change. The first major change in the first episode is the manner in which Marin and Gojo first interact with each other. In the manga, she merely bumps into him and apologizes, but in the anime, Marin's encounter is more over-the-top. She is seen literally flying through the air and landing head-first on the corner of Gojo's desk, which honestly looks very concussion-inducing. A moment later though, she reveals that she is completely fine. This change was probably added to set up the outlandishness and comedy of the show.                  In Episode 5, the anime cuts a scene that occurs while Gojo is taking Marin's photos as Shizuku-tan for the first time. In the manga, Gojo is visibly flustered after Marin states she didn't bring any clothes to change back into. This scene is exchanged in favor of a simpler smartphone photo montage. Similarly in Episode 8, during the beach scene, a fan-servicey panty shot scene is replaced in favor of a bird stealing Marin and Gojo's lunch. In contrast, the iconic love hotel episode is adapted to the tee with no changes whatsoever, much to the excitement of manga fans. The final episode of the series has the most manga to anime changes. It starts off right away with a minor change. In the manga, the episode opens with Gojo working on his next cosplay project, while in the anime, he is working on a doll. The biggest cut in this scene is the presence of Marin's father. In the manga, he comes home to check on Marin and is upset when she reveals that she hasn't been doing her homework, which prompts her to study with Gojo. In the anime, this conversation is reduced to a phone call, and viewers never see Marin's father on screen. RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling's Gojo Is Definitely Written for the Female Gaze Another huge change is the order of events. In the manga, the events occur as follows: the encounter with Marin's father, the school pool scene, the fireworks festival and the scary movie sequence. However, in the anime, the movie scene is split in two and bookends the episode. It occurs as such: movie, pool scene, festival, then concludes with Marin calling Gojo about how scared she is in the post-credit scene after watching the movie's sequel by herself. Understandably, the writers wanted the season to end on a happy note, so they likely changed things around so that Marin could end the season saying the long-awaited ""I love you"" to Gojo, even if he didn't actually hear it. The season ends with Marin looking directly at the camera and saying ""See you later,"" which is probably intended to be a heartfelt fourth wall break.                  Evidently, the anime follows the manga quite closely, and besides some minor cuts and chronological changes, there are no major plot differences from the manga to the movie, which has pleased manga fans. With such a great first season, will the second season be able to hold up? There is no announcement for the second season as of yet, but judging by its success, there will no doubt be an announcement sometime soon.

The season ends with Marin looking directly at the camera and saying ""See you later,"" which is probably intended to be a heartfelt fourth wall break.                  Evidently, the anime follows the manga quite closely, and besides some minor cuts and chronological changes, there are no major plot differences from the manga to the movie, which has pleased manga fans. With such a great first season, will the second season be able to hold up? There is no announcement for the second season as of yet, but judging by its success, there will no doubt be an announcement sometime soon.

By Nerissa Rupnarine Published 4 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    With both a successful anime and manga, the josei series Chihayafuru has sustained a cult following by offering compelling drama and intense sports matches focusing heavily on the Japanese card game of karuta. However, despite being predominantly a sports anime, there have been hints at potential romances throughout the story, with a love triangle forming between the three main characters of Chihaya Ayase, Taichi Mashima and Arata Wataya. Taichi harbors a one-sided crush on the currently oblivious Chihaya, while Chihaya seems to harbor feelings of deep admiration -- possibly more -- for their long-distant friend Arata. While being part of the main storyline from the beginning and a key form of entertainment for some fans, Chihayafuru has so much going for it that the series would be just fine even if there are never any full-blown romantic relationships.  Related: Chihayafuru Announces Manga's Final Volume                  Written and illustrated by Yuki Suetsugu, Chihayafuru began publication in December 2007. A total of 48 volumes have been released so far, with the series set to end with the release of Volume 49. An anime adaptation produced by Madhouse Studios has garnered three seasons and 74 episodes. Both the anime and manga have been met with high praise from fans and critics alike. Putting the romantic tension aside, the three main characters each manage to be complex and entertaining all on their own. Chihaya, while naturally having great reflexes and impeccable hearing -- traits well-suited to playing karuta -- is still growing into her own. She aims to be Queen -- a title awarded to the best female karuta player in Japan -- and she chases this dream with an admirable level of passion, so much so that karuta becomes the focal point of her world. Chihaya dedicates so much love and hard work to the game that her wins are satisfying and her losses difficult to watch, to the point where fans can't help but root for her. Despite excelling both academically and in sports, Taichi is not naturally gifted and works extremely hard to attain perfection due to the high expectations placed upon him by his strict mother. As such, he struggles to learn karuta, although is encouraged by the joy he finds in the game through playing with his friends, Chihaya and Arata. While he first became interested in the game because of Chihaya, over time, he has genuinely come to love it. Arata introduced Karuta to both Chihaya and Taichi. He is hailed as a prodigy in this field and was taught the game by his grandfather, Hajime Wataya, a renowned master in the karuta world. Arata was close with his grandfather, but when he passed away due to illness, Arata began carrying the weight of his grandfather's death on his shoulders. Devastated and grief-stricken, he quit playing karuta. Related: Josei Is Anime & Manga's Most Underrated Demographic                  While the love triangle certainly adds to the drama, the platonic interrelations are just as fascinating. Meeting as children, the friendships between Chihaya, Taichi and Arata are forged and intertwined by karuta. The trio loses contact before junior high school, each falling out of karuta for different reasons. It isn't until high school that Chihaya and Taichi reunite. Eager to play karuta again, she convinces Taichi to start a karuta club with her where they recruit members, introducing their love of the game to newcomers and establishing their own friend group who now all share a common interest. However, while these new friends are great encouragement for climbing up in the tanks, no one motivates Chihaya or Taichi to play to the best of their abilities more than Arata. Although the third main character, Arata is absent throughout most of the story. Rather, it's his memory and distant presence that pushes Chihaya and Taichi considerably, as his karuta skills have always surpassed those of his friends. This makes his limited appearances extremely gratifying, which is only exemplified with silent reminiscences of the strong bond the trio once shared when they were kids before the hardships of life caught up to them. Childhood friends and rivals, they are each on their own journey, attempting to carve out their individual paths as they fight to achieve their dreams. Additionally, while karuta may seem like a trivial, uninteresting card game, like every other sports anime, Chihayafuru uses its characters, story, visuals and soundtrack to amplify the karuta experience. There's never a dull moment, with every match providing plenty of drama and intensity. One of the most standout elements of the anime is the stunning visuals, which are used creatively and silently to showcase the various complicated emotions of the characters. The audience is brought into their world through a poetic lens that mimics the poetry found in karuta. So does the story really need romance? Not really. Chihaya is mostly obsessed with karuta, and has little interest in pursuing a romantic relationship, while Taichi and Arata also strive to be the best they can be. Romance is definitely a side venture, but karuta remains the main focus. Matches are engaging in their own right, and there's a full cast of well-developed characters who further flesh out the story. Whether Chihaya ends up with someone or not, Chihayafuru successfully manages to tell a beautifully conceptualized story about the realities of chasing a dream that's sure to tug at heartstrings.

The series promises to be action-packed, emotional and dramatic, but there's something else about Vampire in the Garden that has caught people's attention: Judging by the trailer, the characters vaguely resemble those of Naruto. Sure enough, Naruto and Vampire in the Garden have been worked on by Tetsuya Nishio. He's just one of the many big names in the anime industry listed as staff members for this upcoming series. There's also the studio to consider. To elaborate, here's a closer look at everyone that Vampire in the Garden is proud to call a part of its production.  RELATED: How Tall Are the Naruto Characters?     The first name to pop up in the trailer is Wit Studio. They're well known for the first three seasons of Attack on Titan. They also animated action series like Seraph of the End (another human vs vampire anime), Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, and Vinland Saga. Other popular works of theirs include The Ancient Magus Bride, After the Rain, and Ranking of Kings. Many of Wit Studio’s anime have gone on to receive critical acclaim, which is a good sign for Vampire in the Garden. If Vampire in the Garden is like any of Wit's other series, then it should have a good balance between dynamic action sequences and engaging drama. The action presented in the trailer certainly lives up to its studio's name. The characters give good and emotional performances, but the drama will depend on how well the story builds up to it; considering who's working on this series, there shouldn't be any concern. If the trailer is anything to go by, Vampire in the Garden should be as good a Wit Studio anime as they come. RELATED: Marco's Final Words on Attack on Titan Are the Anime's Most Important The director for Vampire in the Garden is Makihara Ryōtarō. He's also known for directing Hal and, more importantly, The Empire of Corpses. The latter is a psychological sci-fi movie that delves into the disturbing nature of the undead and reanimation, not unlike Marie Shelley's Frankenstein. That moderate touch of horror would fit perfectly in a vampire-centric narrative. The soundtrack will be composed by Yoshihiro Ike. He's known for composing the music for AIBOU: Tokyo Detective Duo and Tiger & Bunny. He can compose in a broad range of musical styles; his work can be something grand like ""The Hero of Heroes"" or something simple like ""The Mechanic."" For Vampire in the Garden, he might put out more songs like ""The Voice of Thanatos"" or ""Aftermath."" In any case, the soundtrack for this upcoming anime should be full of memorable tunes and melodies. RELATED: The Most Powerful Otsutsuki in Naruto – and How They Got So Strong                  Again, the character designer for this series is Tetsuya Nishio. He's best known for designing characters for the Naruto anime, as well as Naruto: Shippuden and Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. The resemblance is plain to see in the Vampire in the Garden characters, right down to the facial expressions. Even some of their movements and color schemes look familiar. If characters from either of these works swapped places, none of them would look out of place. Naruto fans should certainly get a nostalgic vibe from Vampire in the Garden. As things stand, Vampire in the Garden looks like it's set to be a great new series for anime fans. Not only is it being done by a talented studio, but it has a number of veterans of the industry working on it. Audiences should look forward to watching it when it arrives on Netflix in May.

By Louis Kemner Published 5 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Platinum End Episode 24, ""The Final Arrow,"" now streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation, as well as discussion of suicide. Platinum End's divine battle royale to decide the world's next God ended in Episode 23, and peace returns to Earth in the series finale as the new God Shuji takes his place in the heavens and the arrows are confiscated. Only one red arrow remains with Professor Yoneda, but otherwise it's as though the titanic clash never even happened. Few people even retain memories of it happening. Protagonist Kakehashi Mirai can now resume his humble quest to find true happiness as an ordinary citizen of Earth, and the other God candidates and their associates do the same. While the new God has apocalyptic plans in mind, not even the end of humanity can extinguish true hope and happiness. That is the shonen way.  RELATED: Platinum End's Finale Reveals the Truth of the God Selection Process                  In heaven, the new God-Shuji converses with the original God and they resolve the ""chicken and the egg"" paradox between humanity and God at last. An unknown party or entity created God long ago. God then created humanity, disproving Yoneda's ""parasitic creature"" theory. Meanwhile, God-Shuji observes humanity's endless suffering across the globe and concludes that nothing short of genocide can save it from despair and misery. As the destructive angel Munai had always intended, God-Shuji takes his own life, and the angels and humanity die with him in a massive apocalypse six years after the God candidate battle ended. Starting with the youngest, everyone on Earth vanishes into thin air. Most people feel horror and shock as they see everyone else vanish, until the same happens to them as well. It's a nightmare scenario for 99% of humanity, but one particular couple doesn't mind it so much. Mirai and Saki, who have since gotten married and started their own florist shop, embrace one another and wait for the end to come. Both had once tried to take their own lives but survived, giving each of them a new appreciation of their remaining time on Earth. They perish with no regrets, and even if he must pay for it with his life, Mirai spends his last moments in happiness with the woman he loves as his initial quest comes to a close. This allows Mirai to die happily, as opposed to his misery when he first attempted to take his own life at the start of Platinum End. On one level, this can be interpreted as a suicide prevention message, but there is more to it. RELATED: How Biblically Accurate Are the Angels in Platinum End?                  The sudden apocalypse in Platinum End finale does more than conclude the series by killing off the entire cast at once. It also reaffirms a few basic shonen core values, such as the power of friendship, the virtues of courage and persistence, and the wisdom of seeking selfless and constructive goals. Mirai's goal to find humble happiness may have seemed underwhelming earlier in the series -- especially compared to Light Yagami's quest to become a god of justice in Death Note -- but in the end, Mirai gets the last laugh. He perishes in Saki's arms as the happiest man on earth, with no fear or regrets at all. His simple and mundane goal had allowed him to spend the prior six years in total bliss, and in Episode 24 he dies in peace, and something similar can be said for his wife Saki. However, this generally cannot be said for the rest of Platinum End's cast. The other characters behaved in more selfish ways, and their deaths were equally harsh. The ambitious and cruel Metropoliman died in anguish when Mukaido shot him with a heavy machine gun, and in Episode 24, Professor Yoneda dies while panicking about the state of the world. The selfish hedonist Temari Yuri dies panicking and confused, a poor way to end her life. These characters never sought humble happiness, nor did they try to benefit others. So they receive a fitting end in the finale, while the shonen heroes Mirai and Saki get the best possible end -- a true platinum end.

By Michael Lacerna Published 1 day ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    One of isekai anime's most common tropes is the basis for Wikipedia's April Fools' gag this year. The joke is tucked away in Wikipedia's Did You Know section for April 1. In between joke facts about The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, the page states ""Did you know that a common way to travel to another world is to be hit by a truck?"" The bullet point links out to the Wikipedia entries for the isekai genre and the Truck-kun meme that it spawned. A screencap of the section is provided below. RELATED: How ‘A Realist Hero’ Struggles Against Isekai Fantasy Cliches                   ""Isekai,"" a term roughly translated to ""other world,"" refers to a genre of story that involves the protagonist, who is usually from the real world, being transported into a fantasy or sci-fi world that is substantially different from our own. While stories using this setup have existed for sometime, the genre has exploded in popularity in Japan within the last decade, with the most popular examples being Sword Art Online, That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, So I'm a Spider So What and KonoSuba: God's Blessing on This Wonderful World.   Notably, many of the genre's protagonists, including the heroes of Mushoku Tensei and Didn't I Say To Make My Abilities Average In The Next Life?!, find themselves transported to their new worlds after being struck and killed by an oncoming truck, usually while pushing somebody else out of the way. The trope has become so ubiquitous that it spawned the Truck-kun meme, which posits that the truck is a reoccurring anime character that possesses one of the highest body counts in the history of the medium. The cliche was lampooned in the set-up for one of the genre's most popular series, KonoSuba, in which the hero initially believes he died saving a beautiful girl from an oncoming truck, but is later told that the vehicle was actually a slow-moving tractor that the girl easily avoided, and that his actual cause of death was the stress caused by his overreaction to the situation. The joke has even spawned its own parody manga, Isekai Transporter, which casts the truck as a noble figure that heroically sends young people to be reincarnated into the worlds that need them most. RELATED: How Gundam Creator Yoshiyuki Tomino's ""Aura Battler Dunbine"" Influenced Isekai Many of the previously mentioned isekai anime series are available for streaming on Crunchyroll. Isekai Quartet, a crossover series featuring characters from many of the genre's most popular shows, will premiere a new movie in Japan on June 10.

In Tensai Ouji's Season 1 finale, a more monstrous side emerges.     By Diane Darcy Published 23 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for The Genius Prince’s Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt Episode 12, ""A Really Motivated Seller,"" now streaming on Funimation. The Genius Prince’s Guide has long established that Prince Wein Salema Arbalest is no angel. With his first war alone, Wein demonstrated a lack of empathy for his own army when offering them empty words of encouragement, expecting them to lose the battle with Marden. When they actually won the war -- not once, but twice -- he was genuinely stunned. In addition to having accidentally helped dismantle an entire kingdom, Wein was noticed by other neighboring kingdoms, including the Earthworld Empire. He even received a marriage proposal from Princess Lowellmina of Earthworld, who turned out to be his childhood friend ""Lowa.""  In worse news for Wein, his defeat of Marden got him noticed by the more bigoted western kingdoms of Cavarin, Soljest and Delunio -- all of which subscribe to the Levetian religion with their monarchs being members of the Holy Elite. Delunio in particular owned land in Marden, putting Wein in an even bigger political bind. This caused the western kingdoms to conspire against him, looking to control or even murder him. They were caught off guard, however, by Wein's impulsive murder of King Ordalasse of Cavarin. Now in Episode 12, the protagonist reveals an even more monstrous side in dealing with his biggest foes. RELATED: The Genius Prince’s Guide: Wein Answers Lowa’s Marriage Proposal Amid Chaos                  Wein had been caught fraudulently exporting Earthworld goods as Natran products to the western kingdoms to subvert their refusal to trade with the empire. This action gets Princess Zenovia -- Marden's sole surviving monarch -- in trouble with the western kingdoms, which results in a threat from Delunio's prime minister, Sirgis. Wein takes responsibility for the exports and visits the kingdom of Soljest in order to form an alliance with King Gruyere. To Wein's surprise, he actually agrees to an alliance and shares his more liberal political views, which earns his trust. Unbeknown to Wein, however, King Gruyere's plan was all a ruse to get him out of the way while he conspired with Prime Minister Sirgis behind the scenes to take back Marden's land, which led to Soljest invading Natra. After being played for a fool by Gruyere, Wein realized he had to act quickly to dissolve the alliance between Soljest and Delunio -- easier said than done. Careful planning of that dissolution would’ve gone a lot smoother had Wein gone to Princess Lowa to work out the details, but he didn't want to be indebted to the equally diabolical Lowa. Instead, he cooks up an even worse plan: to threaten genocide. Episode 12 of The Genius Prince's Guide sees Wein and Zenovia pay a visit to Prime Minister Sirgis to try and work out a peaceful reconciliation. Zenovia attempts to appease Sirgis by offering double the land that is owed to Delunio in exchange for getting the Soljest army to stop their invasion of Natra. Sirgis, however, sees through the proposal and doesn't accept her offer. With Zenovia’s plan failing, Wein decides to take matters into his own hands by proposing that Sirgis murder King Gruyere before his kingdom grows to the point of deciding to invade Delunio. Sirgis once again isn't moved -- so Wein goes with Plan B. RELATED: The Genius Prince’s Guide: Wein Gets Burnt By a Certain Princess - & It's Not Lowa                  Knowing that Soljest is too powerful for Natra's army to beat, Wein acknowledges Gruyere will succeed in seizing Natra, which will displace all of its citizens. He also acknowledges his people will seek refuge in other kingdoms, including Delunio, which Sirgis accepts. After getting his ""approval,"" Wein gleefully tells Sirgis he will send all of his people as refugees to Delunio, which catches the prime minister off guard. Sirgis protests by saying his nation can only accept a few hundred refugees, but any more would exhaust Delunio's resources. Wein, however, has a solution to that too. To resolve the problem of overpopulation, Wein tricks Sirgis into thinking he’s been secretly exporting a deadly poison to Delunio's citizens through their clothing. Over time, wearing these poisonous clothes will kill all of Delunio’s citizens and the kingdom would be ripe for the picking for Natra’s refugees. This plan proves too monstrous for Zenovia who is immediately horrified by Wein's logic, even if he's suggesting genocide in jest. Sirgis, though, is in a worse position. While Sirgis does contemplate the possibility Wein is bluffing, at the same time he decides not to stake his political career by risking his own people's lives -- but then cracks under pressure and agrees to ally with Wein to stop Soljest's invasion of Natra. By acquiring Delunio's army, Natra's own now has the support it needs to defeat Soljest and capture King Gruyere. This manages to impress Gruyere, who then awaits his own execution. Wein, however, offers him an alliance with Natra in exchange for learning the secret to Wein's genius. The prince's intelligence shines through once again, but in so doing has revealed an even darker side to his character.

By Michael Lacerna Published 4 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    A talented fan of Akira has begun building a fully functional recreation of Shotaro Kaneda's distinctive motorcycle. The new project comes from Japanese YouTuber and motorcycle enthusiast Ayato. The builder, who is also known by their YouTube screenname Teruteru Boizu, began the project about six months ago. The impressive replica began as an old junk bike, which the YouTuber stripped down to just its frame, engine and tires. Ayato then fabricated a new shell to recreate the look of Kaneda's ride, and built a custom suspension to ensure that bike looked and rode like its anime and manga counterpart. The latest video shows how they added LED lighting to its wheels, recreating the futuristic glow of bike. While the replica is still incomplete and lacks the motorcycle's distinct red paint and corporate branding, it is already a very impressive recreation of what may be the most famous bike in anime and manga history.  RELATED: Absolutely Perfect Elden Ring/Akira Fan Art Hypes the Looming Release Date     The full video series of how Ayato built the bike can be viewed on their YouTube channel. Of course, this isn't the first time that Kaneda's bike has appeared in the real world: another Akira fan, Masashi Teshima, made their own working replica of the motorcycle in 2012. Teshima's replica was so accurate that it was officially recognized by series creator Katsuhiro Otomo. Teshima rode the bike across Japan as part of a charity drive in order to raise money for a children's autism organization and later to help the victims of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Teshima's bike took significantly more time and money to make than Ayato's newer project, however: that replica was built over the course of seven years and cost over $100,000 USD to create. RELATED: Akira Fan Spots Animator's Hidden On-Screen Complaint Akira began as a manga by writer and artist Katsuhiro Otomo, which was first published in 1982. The manga was adapted into an anime movie in 1988, which Otomo directed himself. The manga was both a commercial and critical success, earning an Eisner Award and the Kodansha Manga Award, while the anime adaptation is widely credited with helping to establish anime's international popularity with adult audiences in the early 1990s. The series is now widely regarded as not just one of the best anime and manga titles of the era, but as a landmark work in the cyberpunk genre. Otomo's original manga is now available in English from publisher Kodansha Comics. The movie is distributed in North America by Funimation, who recently re-released the film on 4K Blu-ray. A live-action adaptation has been in development for some time, with Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi attached to the project.

03-04-2022,anime,7,0,https://www.cbr.com/akira-kaneda-motorcycle-replica/,Akira Fan Builds Working Replica of Kaneda’s Iconic Motorcycle,"   Akira Fan Builds Working Replica of Kaneda’s Iconic Motorcycle A Japanese fan is building a fully functional replica of Kaneda's motorcycle from Katsuhiro Otomo's anime classic, Akira.      By Michael Lacerna Published 4 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    A talented fan of Akira has begun building a fully functional recreation of Shotaro Kaneda's distinctive motorcycle. The new project comes from Japanese YouTuber and motorcycle enthusiast Ayato. The builder, who is also known by their YouTube screenname Teruteru Boizu, began the project about six months ago. The impressive replica began as an old junk bike, which the YouTuber stripped down to just its frame, engine and tires. Ayato then fabricated a new shell to recreate the look of Kaneda's ride, and built a custom suspension to ensure that bike looked and rode like its anime and manga counterpart. The latest video shows how they added LED lighting to its wheels, recreating the futuristic glow of bike. While the replica is still incomplete and lacks the motorcycle's distinct red paint and corporate branding, it is already a very impressive recreation of what may be the most famous bike in anime and manga history.  RELATED: Absolutely Perfect Elden Ring/Akira Fan Art Hypes the Looming Release Date     The full video series of how Ayato built the bike can be viewed on their YouTube channel. Of course, this isn't the first time that Kaneda's bike has appeared in the real world: another Akira fan, Masashi Teshima, made their own working replica of the motorcycle in 2012. Teshima's replica was so accurate that it was officially recognized by series creator Katsuhiro Otomo. Teshima rode the bike across Japan as part of a charity drive in order to raise money for a children's autism organization and later to help the victims of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Teshima's bike took significantly more time and money to make than Ayato's newer project, however: that replica was built over the course of seven years and cost over $100,000 USD to create. RELATED: Akira Fan Spots Animator's Hidden On-Screen Complaint Akira began as a manga by writer and artist Katsuhiro Otomo, which was first published in 1982. The manga was adapted into an anime movie in 1988, which Otomo directed himself. The manga was both a commercial and critical success, earning an Eisner Award and the Kodansha Manga Award, while the anime adaptation is widely credited with helping to establish anime's international popularity with adult audiences in the early 1990s. The series is now widely regarded as not just one of the best anime and manga titles of the era, but as a landmark work in the cyberpunk genre. Otomo's original manga is now available in English from publisher Kodansha Comics. The movie is distributed in North America by Funimation, who recently re-released the film on 4K Blu-ray. A live-action adaptation has been in development for some time, with Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi attached to the project.

Here's why the comedy series Spy x Family is good.     By Marla Añonuevo Published Mar 26, 2022      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The Spring 2022 season is coming, and one of the highly anticipated shows is Tatsuya Endo’s action-comedy manga series, Spy x Family. It is under Shonen Jump, but the series steers away from elements usually found in many of the titles under this magazine. Spy x Family offers a refreshing new take on stories targeted for shonen. Numerous factors make the show appealing, but the premise will hook potential fans in immediately. Spy x Family revolves around the Forgers -- a pretend family with their own secret identities, which they are unaware of. A spy who goes by the name Twilight assumes the fatherly role of Loid Forger, a psychiatrist. Anya, the child, is a telepath. Meanwhile, the mother, Yor, is an assassin known as the Thorn Princess. Even though secrecy is a significant theme within the family (and the story), these members seem to be a perfect match for each other.  RELATED: Shonen Jump’s Spy X Family: Plot, Characters & How to Get Started                  The story begins with Twilight, a master of disguise. He’s a top agent of the Westalis’ Intelligence Services’ Eastern-Focused Division (WISE), an organization whose goal is to keep the peace between the countries Westalis and Ostania. Twilight's latest mission, Operation Strix, requires him to get married and have a family within a week. While it may seem like an impossible feat to obtain a wife and a child within mere days, he pulls through. He adopts Anya from an orphanage, and shortly after, he and Yor impulsively decide to get married while being chased by enemies. If that alone is not enticing enough, it gets better. Each member has their respective agenda and motivations for wanting to maintain the fake family. Twilight needs this to get close to his target. Yor needs the sham marriage to keep her assassin gig and conform better to societal standards. Meanwhile, Anya thought it would be exciting to have a spy and an assassin as parents. Funnily enough, Anya is the only one who generally knows what's truly going on -- but of course, her understanding of it is limited since she's a young child. With that, there are instances where Anya acts accordingly for the sake of the mission. However, it almost always never goes smoothly. This usually results in some of the many hilarious moments in the story. RELATED: Meet the Forgers in the Latest Spy x Family Anime Trailer                   Aside from the Forgers, Spy x Family has an equally interesting ensemble of supporting characters. Yor’s younger brother, Yuri, works for the State Security Service (which is basically WISE’s enemy). To keep with the theme of “secrets” in the story, Yor is unaware of Yuri’s actual occupation and thinks he’s a civil servant. He disapproves of Yor and Loid since he's incredibly attached to his sister. Henry Henderson, a teacher at Eden Academy, has a striking first impression. He embodies the word ""exaggeration"" in his character introduction, which is ironically funny considering how people at the prestigious Eden Academy are expected to be prim and proper. Considering some of the subject matter, certain aspects of Spy x Family might give off a serious tone -- but overall, the story is light and entertaining. A dysfunctional family involving a spy, an assassin, and a telepath is pretty much a killer recipe for a chaotic dynamic. This may be fairly troublesome, especially knowing that world peace more or less lies within the hands of the Forgers. Their struggles as a group and how their secret identities affect the mission show us (in various ways) that maintaining and raising a family is indeed one of the world's most challenging tasks.
