It looks more kid friendly than the original comics(they took themselves a little too seriously IMO), but Iove more action kid shows. Reminds me a lot of the nick TMNT in the mid 2010s.

Back to top                  Generations    Joined: 21 Jul 2016 		    Posts: 172       Posted: Fri Apr 01, 2022 4:01 pm            I'll be honest, I don't know what I expected, but this wasn't it. And I can't say I'm a fan of it.   The trailer makes the show come off as a bit generic, with the comedy and the dialogue, and aside from all the similar names I can't see any connection to the source material at all. It may as well have been anything.   Can't say I'm interested to see this one.

Like, I think there's validity to that, but it's not really Usagi Yojimbo. I was already disappointed that this wasn't going to be a straight adaption of the comic, but even tonally it feels entirely different. The fact that his descendant gets a home base with his friends is so different from Usagi's warrior pilgrimage as a Ronin.    And, like, Usagi did way more than fight Yokai. Yokai was like the thing Usagi liked dealing with the least. He hated every time Sasuke dragged him into something involving Yokai.    Also, I'm genuinely surprised there doesn't seem to be a new version of Jei in this.

Sakai has done something like this before --- there are some ""Space Usagi"" stories set in the future, with reincarnated characters we know.  Mix in some of the stores of apprentice Usagi.   I'm guessing there's a preponderance of ""talking animals are for kids/we can't really do furry-Kurosawa"" among the boring money people, and the model they're working from is something like Kung-fu Panda more than Kubo and the two strings.

Sakai has done something like this before --- there are some ""Space Usagi"" stories set in the future, with reincarnated characters we know.  Mix in some of the stores of apprentice Usagi.   I'm guessing there's a preponderance of ""talking animals are for kids/we can't really do furry-Kurosawa"" among the boring money people, and the model they're working from is something like Kung-fu Panda more than Kubo and the two strings.

And I can't say I'm a fan of it.   The trailer makes the show come off as a bit generic, with the comedy and the dialogue, and aside from all the similar names I can't see any connection to the source material at all. It may as well have been anything.   Can't say I'm interested to see this one.

Like, I think there's validity to that, but it's not really Usagi Yojimbo. I was already disappointed that this wasn't going to be a straight adaption of the comic, but even tonally it feels entirely different. The fact that his descendant gets a home base with his friends is so different from Usagi's warrior pilgrimage as a Ronin.    And, like, Usagi did way more than fight Yokai. Yokai was like the thing Usagi liked dealing with the least. He hated every time Sasuke dragged him into something involving Yokai.    Also, I'm genuinely surprised there doesn't seem to be a new version of Jei in this.

It looks more kid friendly than the original comics(they took themselves a little too seriously IMO), but Iove more action kid shows. Reminds me a lot of the nick TMNT in the mid 2010s.

And I can't say I'm a fan of it.   The trailer makes the show come off as a bit generic, with the comedy and the dialogue, and aside from all the similar names I can't see any connection to the source material at all. It may as well have been anything.   Can't say I'm interested to see this one.

Like, I think there's validity to that, but it's not really Usagi Yojimbo. I was already disappointed that this wasn't going to be a straight adaption of the comic, but even tonally it feels entirely different. The fact that his descendant gets a home base with his friends is so different from Usagi's warrior pilgrimage as a Ronin.    And, like, Usagi did way more than fight Yokai. Yokai was like the thing Usagi liked dealing with the least. He hated every time Sasuke dragged him into something involving Yokai.    Also, I'm genuinely surprised there doesn't seem to be a new version of Jei in this.

Sakai has done something like this before --- there are some ""Space Usagi"" stories set in the future, with reincarnated characters we know.  Mix in some of the stores of apprentice Usagi.   I'm guessing there's a preponderance of ""talking animals are for kids/we can't really do furry-Kurosawa"" among the boring money people, and the model they're working from is something like Kung-fu Panda more than Kubo and the two strings.

How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 Episode 12  by Grant Jones, Mar 29th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8            This week's How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom episode brings us back to the head-scratching decisions of the earlier episodes.    There's really no getting around it: I found the first half of this episode bizarre and dull. Excel Walter teaching wife classes to the ladies is an idea that seems to come completely out of nowhere. We've spent multiple plot-heavy episodes engaging in fraught political maneuvering, so I don't necessarily think it's a bad idea to explore more character-centric threads for a little bit, but at the same time there's zero attempt at easing us into the transition here. We just smash cut to wifey classes. I almost wondered if I'd missed an episode on accident in the last week.    Furthermore, we've not been given any indication that there's anything wrong with any of Souma's various relationships up until this point. Putting aside my general apprehension with harem stories, what do the ladies need to learn, exactly? We haven't seen any of them make many mistakes that have upset Souma, and of course they're all over the moon for him. There's a sense that this lesson is supposed to be the sort of proper etiquette instruction that members of the royalty historically received (the echoes of which are still present today). But the framing here is more akin to a big class session with all of them together reading from Souma's mind journal which just feels… weird.    For that matter, who wants this? I know it's a dangerous thought experiment to ask for sense-making here, but I truly have to wonder who would want to sit in a room and have someone's darkest thoughts read out to them in front of their romantic rivals (or romantic peers?). Putting aside how invasive an act it is, I can't imagine wanting to have someone's deepest and most hidden thoughts about me read aloud in front of an audience. It just seems like something that would be terribly uncomfortable for everyone involved (and not to mention the little black books that they get to peruse as well…)    On a more positive note, we do at least get some delightful reaction faces from the ladies of the cast. They get to be a bit more cartoonish and silly and just generally more expressive than usual. That's fun if nothing else. Also, the scene where Poncho returns and has perfected the sauce that will allow for squid yakisoba is a lot of fun. There's some terrific energy in the seiyuu's performances that makes it feel like a real triumph. Lastly, Liscia and Souma simply sitting together and doing nothing but sharing some fruit and warmth is a genuinely sweet scene that stands in stark contrast to the arbitrariness of the weird wife school segment. This, to me, felt real. Love can make even doing nothing together feel quite special.    With all that said, the pacing of the show is starting to get to me. I'm hoping we can get a bit more tension and high stakes in the coming episodes to break up the slow pace we've been on for a few weeks.

How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 Episode 12  by Grant Jones, Mar 29th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8            This week's How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom episode brings us back to the head-scratching decisions of the earlier episodes.    There's really no getting around it: I found the first half of this episode bizarre and dull. Excel Walter teaching wife classes to the ladies is an idea that seems to come completely out of nowhere. We've spent multiple plot-heavy episodes engaging in fraught political maneuvering, so I don't necessarily think it's a bad idea to explore more character-centric threads for a little bit, but at the same time there's zero attempt at easing us into the transition here. We just smash cut to wifey classes. I almost wondered if I'd missed an episode on accident in the last week.    Furthermore, we've not been given any indication that there's anything wrong with any of Souma's various relationships up until this point. Putting aside my general apprehension with harem stories, what do the ladies need to learn, exactly? We haven't seen any of them make many mistakes that have upset Souma, and of course they're all over the moon for him. There's a sense that this lesson is supposed to be the sort of proper etiquette instruction that members of the royalty historically received (the echoes of which are still present today). But the framing here is more akin to a big class session with all of them together reading from Souma's mind journal which just feels… weird.    For that matter, who wants this? I know it's a dangerous thought experiment to ask for sense-making here, but I truly have to wonder who would want to sit in a room and have someone's darkest thoughts read out to them in front of their romantic rivals (or romantic peers?). Putting aside how invasive an act it is, I can't imagine wanting to have someone's deepest and most hidden thoughts about me read aloud in front of an audience. It just seems like something that would be terribly uncomfortable for everyone involved (and not to mention the little black books that they get to peruse as well…)    On a more positive note, we do at least get some delightful reaction faces from the ladies of the cast. They get to be a bit more cartoonish and silly and just generally more expressive than usual. That's fun if nothing else. Also, the scene where Poncho returns and has perfected the sauce that will allow for squid yakisoba is a lot of fun. There's some terrific energy in the seiyuu's performances that makes it feel like a real triumph. Lastly, Liscia and Souma simply sitting together and doing nothing but sharing some fruit and warmth is a genuinely sweet scene that stands in stark contrast to the arbitrariness of the weird wife school segment. This, to me, felt real. Love can make even doing nothing together feel quite special.    With all that said, the pacing of the show is starting to get to me. I'm hoping we can get a bit more tension and high stakes in the coming episodes to break up the slow pace we've been on for a few weeks.

How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 Episode 12  by Grant Jones, Mar 29th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8            This week's How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom episode brings us back to the head-scratching decisions of the earlier episodes.    There's really no getting around it: I found the first half of this episode bizarre and dull. Excel Walter teaching wife classes to the ladies is an idea that seems to come completely out of nowhere. We've spent multiple plot-heavy episodes engaging in fraught political maneuvering, so I don't necessarily think it's a bad idea to explore more character-centric threads for a little bit, but at the same time there's zero attempt at easing us into the transition here. We just smash cut to wifey classes. I almost wondered if I'd missed an episode on accident in the last week.    Furthermore, we've not been given any indication that there's anything wrong with any of Souma's various relationships up until this point. Putting aside my general apprehension with harem stories, what do the ladies need to learn, exactly? We haven't seen any of them make many mistakes that have upset Souma, and of course they're all over the moon for him. There's a sense that this lesson is supposed to be the sort of proper etiquette instruction that members of the royalty historically received (the echoes of which are still present today). But the framing here is more akin to a big class session with all of them together reading from Souma's mind journal which just feels… weird.    For that matter, who wants this? I know it's a dangerous thought experiment to ask for sense-making here, but I truly have to wonder who would want to sit in a room and have someone's darkest thoughts read out to them in front of their romantic rivals (or romantic peers?). Putting aside how invasive an act it is, I can't imagine wanting to have someone's deepest and most hidden thoughts about me read aloud in front of an audience. It just seems like something that would be terribly uncomfortable for everyone involved (and not to mention the little black books that they get to peruse as well…)    On a more positive note, we do at least get some delightful reaction faces from the ladies of the cast. They get to be a bit more cartoonish and silly and just generally more expressive than usual. That's fun if nothing else. Also, the scene where Poncho returns and has perfected the sauce that will allow for squid yakisoba is a lot of fun. There's some terrific energy in the seiyuu's performances that makes it feel like a real triumph. Lastly, Liscia and Souma simply sitting together and doing nothing but sharing some fruit and warmth is a genuinely sweet scene that stands in stark contrast to the arbitrariness of the weird wife school segment. This, to me, felt real. Love can make even doing nothing together feel quite special.    With all that said, the pacing of the show is starting to get to me. I'm hoping we can get a bit more tension and high stakes in the coming episodes to break up the slow pace we've been on for a few weeks.

World's End Harem Episode 11  by Steve Jones, Mar 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of World’s End Harem ?                     Community score: 2.0           After eleven weeks of flaunting digitally-scorched sexual conquests wearing flimsy sci-fi conspiracy negligee, World’s End Harem ends with a little more banging, but mostly with a lot of pathetic whimpers. Limping and tumbling on its way to the finish line, the episode can barely hold itself together, and it's all in the service of a nonconclusion that does little to tie off any threads and even less to whet the audience's appetite for more. Even the most diehard Doi stans will have to admit this finale is garbage. It's an embarrassing note to end on, and for World’s End Harem, that's the perfect curtain call.    There's no point digging into the plot. It's a confused and purely perfunctory mess that, after twenty minutes, just amounts to reuniting Reito with Erisa—and they don't even kiss! Rather, the unmissable hallmark of this episode is how unfinished it is. World’s End Harem never looked good to begin with, but even those scant corners it possessed are sliced into oblivion here. Long stills and pans plague the episode, and in most of them, the mouths aren't drawn. So you'll be looking at a character unloading a paragraph's worth of exposition, and half of their face just doesn't exist. The whole industry is in a slow and excruciating freefall thanks to production bloat, and even most high-profile shows struggle to put episodes together these days, so bottom feeders like World’s End Harem really have no chance. However, if there wasn't time to animate the mouths, they should have gone avant-garde and used the censors to cover them up. At least that would have been funny and tongue-in-cheek instead of just bad.    And speaking of things that are bad, Doi's material remains the worst, most navel-gazing component of a series that didn't really have much going for it in the first place. This term didn't exist in the online lexicon when the anime began, but as a creative work inexorably tethered to both its text and subtext, World’s End Harem is the dictionary definition of “maidenless behavior.” Doi lives out the pathetic and unimaginative power fantasy of the specific strain of virgin obsessed with their own virginity to the point of embittered entitlement. This comes to a laughable head when Karen uses science magic to both age him up and cure his eyesight, physically completing his transition from “loser” to “chad,” as if his arc weren't blatant enough. Literally all of his problems have been solved by fucking women like they're entirely disposable. He kept a girl chained up in his bedroom, and now he is the only man on the planet legally allowed to plow. And despite everything, he's still too much of a nerd to be affably evil, which has been the sole unintentionally redeeming factor of his story. The writing is simply too incompetent to make him cool. He's just a pathetic husk wrapped around a contradictory collage of toxic masculine ideals. A caricature in the guise of a champion. The Ozymandias of orgasms.    The UW takes a backseat to all this, which is unfortunate, because while it has emerged as the most offensive part of the show (excluding Doi), it's also now the most interesting. I want to know more about this secret man-hating triumvirate who managed to engineer the worst act of bioterrorism in history but also cannot muster the competency to kill five below-average men. I want to know more about Chloe's dedicated lesbian BDSM room. I want to see Karen deliver a nationwide address as prime minister while looking and sounding exactly the way she does now. Like, hopefully I don't have to explain why conflating feminism with hating men, and then further conflating hating men with total androcide is disingenuous at best. World’s End Harem's dog-whistling really wants you to be impressed with it, as if it's the very first narrative in history brave enough to consider that killing off all men would be a little bit fucked up. It can't even be bothered to be creative with its misogyny.    Credit where it's due, there is one character beat in this finale that I genuinely liked: Kyoji deciding to stay behind so he can be with all of the women he knocked up. The way it's presented is very funny, showing us a collage of photo ops featuring smiling Kyojis and a smattering of different pregnant woman, but it's also kinda sweet as well. It might be the one altruistic thing anyone has ever done in this show. And furthermore, Kyoji's determination provides a great contrast to Reito's spinelessness. Once more, our supposed protagonist does nothing but get dragged around by the proactive women who surround him. He has a chance to take Mira with him—not to screw her, as she suggests, but to fight and do something to pull her away from the obviously evil UW—yet he just lets her go. He has made exactly one choice for himself all season, and when fate inexplicably decides to reward his ambition-bereft behavior by reuniting him with the one woman he's been saving himself for, he displays all the passion of a box of Wheat Thins. I can hate Doi, but I can't feel anything about Reito. He is blankness incarnate. He is an absence. He is a void emptier than the ones that attach themselves to any exposed nipple.    Ultimately, I can't recommend World’s End Harem even as an ironic pleasure. There was no chance for it to be sexy, and even less chance for it to be good, so absurdity was pretty much the only thing going for it. And there's just not enough ridiculousness spread over eleven episodes to make World’s End Harem overall worthwhile. There were moments, to be sure. I had a blast with a handful of episodes, and the particularities of reviewing a piece of hot garbage weekly made my experience a bit more fun and rewarding than it otherwise would have been. I cannot, however, justify a universal recommendation. There's better trash out there. You deserve better trash. Let me take this one for the team, and I'm taking it straight to the incinerator.    Rating:                 World’s End Harem is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.    Steve can be found on Twitter if you want to read his World’s End Harem livetweets. Otherwise, catch him chatting about trash and treasure alike on This Week in Anime.  <prevEpisodes 1-2 Episode 3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episode 6 Episode 7 Episode 8 Episode 9 Episode 10 Episode 11     discuss this in the forum (101 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to World's End Harem Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          39 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 39 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

World's End Harem Episode 11  by Steve Jones, Mar 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of World’s End Harem ?                     Community score: 2.0           After eleven weeks of flaunting digitally-scorched sexual conquests wearing flimsy sci-fi conspiracy negligee, World’s End Harem ends with a little more banging, but mostly with a lot of pathetic whimpers. Limping and tumbling on its way to the finish line, the episode can barely hold itself together, and it's all in the service of a nonconclusion that does little to tie off any threads and even less to whet the audience's appetite for more. Even the most diehard Doi stans will have to admit this finale is garbage. It's an embarrassing note to end on, and for World’s End Harem, that's the perfect curtain call.    There's no point digging into the plot. It's a confused and purely perfunctory mess that, after twenty minutes, just amounts to reuniting Reito with Erisa—and they don't even kiss! Rather, the unmissable hallmark of this episode is how unfinished it is. World’s End Harem never looked good to begin with, but even those scant corners it possessed are sliced into oblivion here. Long stills and pans plague the episode, and in most of them, the mouths aren't drawn. So you'll be looking at a character unloading a paragraph's worth of exposition, and half of their face just doesn't exist. The whole industry is in a slow and excruciating freefall thanks to production bloat, and even most high-profile shows struggle to put episodes together these days, so bottom feeders like World’s End Harem really have no chance. However, if there wasn't time to animate the mouths, they should have gone avant-garde and used the censors to cover them up. At least that would have been funny and tongue-in-cheek instead of just bad.    And speaking of things that are bad, Doi's material remains the worst, most navel-gazing component of a series that didn't really have much going for it in the first place. This term didn't exist in the online lexicon when the anime began, but as a creative work inexorably tethered to both its text and subtext, World’s End Harem is the dictionary definition of “maidenless behavior.” Doi lives out the pathetic and unimaginative power fantasy of the specific strain of virgin obsessed with their own virginity to the point of embittered entitlement. This comes to a laughable head when Karen uses science magic to both age him up and cure his eyesight, physically completing his transition from “loser” to “chad,” as if his arc weren't blatant enough. Literally all of his problems have been solved by fucking women like they're entirely disposable. He kept a girl chained up in his bedroom, and now he is the only man on the planet legally allowed to plow. And despite everything, he's still too much of a nerd to be affably evil, which has been the sole unintentionally redeeming factor of his story. The writing is simply too incompetent to make him cool. He's just a pathetic husk wrapped around a contradictory collage of toxic masculine ideals. A caricature in the guise of a champion. The Ozymandias of orgasms.    The UW takes a backseat to all this, which is unfortunate, because while it has emerged as the most offensive part of the show (excluding Doi), it's also now the most interesting. I want to know more about this secret man-hating triumvirate who managed to engineer the worst act of bioterrorism in history but also cannot muster the competency to kill five below-average men. I want to know more about Chloe's dedicated lesbian BDSM room. I want to see Karen deliver a nationwide address as prime minister while looking and sounding exactly the way she does now. Like, hopefully I don't have to explain why conflating feminism with hating men, and then further conflating hating men with total androcide is disingenuous at best. World’s End Harem's dog-whistling really wants you to be impressed with it, as if it's the very first narrative in history brave enough to consider that killing off all men would be a little bit fucked up. It can't even be bothered to be creative with its misogyny.    Credit where it's due, there is one character beat in this finale that I genuinely liked: Kyoji deciding to stay behind so he can be with all of the women he knocked up. The way it's presented is very funny, showing us a collage of photo ops featuring smiling Kyojis and a smattering of different pregnant woman, but it's also kinda sweet as well. It might be the one altruistic thing anyone has ever done in this show. And furthermore, Kyoji's determination provides a great contrast to Reito's spinelessness. Once more, our supposed protagonist does nothing but get dragged around by the proactive women who surround him. He has a chance to take Mira with him—not to screw her, as she suggests, but to fight and do something to pull her away from the obviously evil UW—yet he just lets her go. He has made exactly one choice for himself all season, and when fate inexplicably decides to reward his ambition-bereft behavior by reuniting him with the one woman he's been saving himself for, he displays all the passion of a box of Wheat Thins. I can hate Doi, but I can't feel anything about Reito. He is blankness incarnate. He is an absence. He is a void emptier than the ones that attach themselves to any exposed nipple.    Ultimately, I can't recommend World’s End Harem even as an ironic pleasure. There was no chance for it to be sexy, and even less chance for it to be good, so absurdity was pretty much the only thing going for it. And there's just not enough ridiculousness spread over eleven episodes to make World’s End Harem overall worthwhile. There were moments, to be sure. I had a blast with a handful of episodes, and the particularities of reviewing a piece of hot garbage weekly made my experience a bit more fun and rewarding than it otherwise would have been. I cannot, however, justify a universal recommendation. There's better trash out there. You deserve better trash. Let me take this one for the team, and I'm taking it straight to the incinerator.    Rating:                 World’s End Harem is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.    Steve can be found on Twitter if you want to read his World’s End Harem livetweets. Otherwise, catch him chatting about trash and treasure alike on This Week in Anime.  <prevEpisodes 1-2 Episode 3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episode 6 Episode 7 Episode 8 Episode 9 Episode 10 Episode 11     discuss this in the forum (101 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to World's End Harem Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          39 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 39 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

World's End Harem Episode 11  by Steve Jones, Mar 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of World’s End Harem ?                     Community score: 2.0           After eleven weeks of flaunting digitally-scorched sexual conquests wearing flimsy sci-fi conspiracy negligee, World’s End Harem ends with a little more banging, but mostly with a lot of pathetic whimpers. Limping and tumbling on its way to the finish line, the episode can barely hold itself together, and it's all in the service of a nonconclusion that does little to tie off any threads and even less to whet the audience's appetite for more. Even the most diehard Doi stans will have to admit this finale is garbage. It's an embarrassing note to end on, and for World’s End Harem, that's the perfect curtain call.    There's no point digging into the plot. It's a confused and purely perfunctory mess that, after twenty minutes, just amounts to reuniting Reito with Erisa—and they don't even kiss! Rather, the unmissable hallmark of this episode is how unfinished it is. World’s End Harem never looked good to begin with, but even those scant corners it possessed are sliced into oblivion here. Long stills and pans plague the episode, and in most of them, the mouths aren't drawn. So you'll be looking at a character unloading a paragraph's worth of exposition, and half of their face just doesn't exist. The whole industry is in a slow and excruciating freefall thanks to production bloat, and even most high-profile shows struggle to put episodes together these days, so bottom feeders like World’s End Harem really have no chance. However, if there wasn't time to animate the mouths, they should have gone avant-garde and used the censors to cover them up. At least that would have been funny and tongue-in-cheek instead of just bad.    And speaking of things that are bad, Doi's material remains the worst, most navel-gazing component of a series that didn't really have much going for it in the first place. This term didn't exist in the online lexicon when the anime began, but as a creative work inexorably tethered to both its text and subtext, World’s End Harem is the dictionary definition of “maidenless behavior.” Doi lives out the pathetic and unimaginative power fantasy of the specific strain of virgin obsessed with their own virginity to the point of embittered entitlement. This comes to a laughable head when Karen uses science magic to both age him up and cure his eyesight, physically completing his transition from “loser” to “chad,” as if his arc weren't blatant enough. Literally all of his problems have been solved by fucking women like they're entirely disposable. He kept a girl chained up in his bedroom, and now he is the only man on the planet legally allowed to plow. And despite everything, he's still too much of a nerd to be affably evil, which has been the sole unintentionally redeeming factor of his story. The writing is simply too incompetent to make him cool. He's just a pathetic husk wrapped around a contradictory collage of toxic masculine ideals. A caricature in the guise of a champion. The Ozymandias of orgasms.    The UW takes a backseat to all this, which is unfortunate, because while it has emerged as the most offensive part of the show (excluding Doi), it's also now the most interesting. I want to know more about this secret man-hating triumvirate who managed to engineer the worst act of bioterrorism in history but also cannot muster the competency to kill five below-average men. I want to know more about Chloe's dedicated lesbian BDSM room. I want to see Karen deliver a nationwide address as prime minister while looking and sounding exactly the way she does now. Like, hopefully I don't have to explain why conflating feminism with hating men, and then further conflating hating men with total androcide is disingenuous at best. World’s End Harem's dog-whistling really wants you to be impressed with it, as if it's the very first narrative in history brave enough to consider that killing off all men would be a little bit fucked up. It can't even be bothered to be creative with its misogyny.    Credit where it's due, there is one character beat in this finale that I genuinely liked: Kyoji deciding to stay behind so he can be with all of the women he knocked up. The way it's presented is very funny, showing us a collage of photo ops featuring smiling Kyojis and a smattering of different pregnant woman, but it's also kinda sweet as well. It might be the one altruistic thing anyone has ever done in this show. And furthermore, Kyoji's determination provides a great contrast to Reito's spinelessness. Once more, our supposed protagonist does nothing but get dragged around by the proactive women who surround him. He has a chance to take Mira with him—not to screw her, as she suggests, but to fight and do something to pull her away from the obviously evil UW—yet he just lets her go. He has made exactly one choice for himself all season, and when fate inexplicably decides to reward his ambition-bereft behavior by reuniting him with the one woman he's been saving himself for, he displays all the passion of a box of Wheat Thins. I can hate Doi, but I can't feel anything about Reito. He is blankness incarnate. He is an absence. He is a void emptier than the ones that attach themselves to any exposed nipple.    Ultimately, I can't recommend World’s End Harem even as an ironic pleasure. There was no chance for it to be sexy, and even less chance for it to be good, so absurdity was pretty much the only thing going for it. And there's just not enough ridiculousness spread over eleven episodes to make World’s End Harem overall worthwhile. There were moments, to be sure. I had a blast with a handful of episodes, and the particularities of reviewing a piece of hot garbage weekly made my experience a bit more fun and rewarding than it otherwise would have been. I cannot, however, justify a universal recommendation. There's better trash out there. You deserve better trash. Let me take this one for the team, and I'm taking it straight to the incinerator.

World's End Harem Episode 11  by Steve Jones, Mar 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of World’s End Harem ?                     Community score: 2.0           After eleven weeks of flaunting digitally-scorched sexual conquests wearing flimsy sci-fi conspiracy negligee, World’s End Harem ends with a little more banging, but mostly with a lot of pathetic whimpers. Limping and tumbling on its way to the finish line, the episode can barely hold itself together, and it's all in the service of a nonconclusion that does little to tie off any threads and even less to whet the audience's appetite for more. Even the most diehard Doi stans will have to admit this finale is garbage. It's an embarrassing note to end on, and for World’s End Harem, that's the perfect curtain call.    There's no point digging into the plot. It's a confused and purely perfunctory mess that, after twenty minutes, just amounts to reuniting Reito with Erisa—and they don't even kiss! Rather, the unmissable hallmark of this episode is how unfinished it is. World’s End Harem never looked good to begin with, but even those scant corners it possessed are sliced into oblivion here. Long stills and pans plague the episode, and in most of them, the mouths aren't drawn. So you'll be looking at a character unloading a paragraph's worth of exposition, and half of their face just doesn't exist. The whole industry is in a slow and excruciating freefall thanks to production bloat, and even most high-profile shows struggle to put episodes together these days, so bottom feeders like World’s End Harem really have no chance. However, if there wasn't time to animate the mouths, they should have gone avant-garde and used the censors to cover them up. At least that would have been funny and tongue-in-cheek instead of just bad.    And speaking of things that are bad, Doi's material remains the worst, most navel-gazing component of a series that didn't really have much going for it in the first place. This term didn't exist in the online lexicon when the anime began, but as a creative work inexorably tethered to both its text and subtext, World’s End Harem is the dictionary definition of “maidenless behavior.” Doi lives out the pathetic and unimaginative power fantasy of the specific strain of virgin obsessed with their own virginity to the point of embittered entitlement. This comes to a laughable head when Karen uses science magic to both age him up and cure his eyesight, physically completing his transition from “loser” to “chad,” as if his arc weren't blatant enough. Literally all of his problems have been solved by fucking women like they're entirely disposable. He kept a girl chained up in his bedroom, and now he is the only man on the planet legally allowed to plow. And despite everything, he's still too much of a nerd to be affably evil, which has been the sole unintentionally redeeming factor of his story. The writing is simply too incompetent to make him cool. He's just a pathetic husk wrapped around a contradictory collage of toxic masculine ideals. A caricature in the guise of a champion. The Ozymandias of orgasms.    The UW takes a backseat to all this, which is unfortunate, because while it has emerged as the most offensive part of the show (excluding Doi), it's also now the most interesting. I want to know more about this secret man-hating triumvirate who managed to engineer the worst act of bioterrorism in history but also cannot muster the competency to kill five below-average men. I want to know more about Chloe's dedicated lesbian BDSM room. I want to see Karen deliver a nationwide address as prime minister while looking and sounding exactly the way she does now. Like, hopefully I don't have to explain why conflating feminism with hating men, and then further conflating hating men with total androcide is disingenuous at best. World’s End Harem's dog-whistling really wants you to be impressed with it, as if it's the very first narrative in history brave enough to consider that killing off all men would be a little bit fucked up. It can't even be bothered to be creative with its misogyny.    Credit where it's due, there is one character beat in this finale that I genuinely liked: Kyoji deciding to stay behind so he can be with all of the women he knocked up. The way it's presented is very funny, showing us a collage of photo ops featuring smiling Kyojis and a smattering of different pregnant woman, but it's also kinda sweet as well. It might be the one altruistic thing anyone has ever done in this show. And furthermore, Kyoji's determination provides a great contrast to Reito's spinelessness. Once more, our supposed protagonist does nothing but get dragged around by the proactive women who surround him. He has a chance to take Mira with him—not to screw her, as she suggests, but to fight and do something to pull her away from the obviously evil UW—yet he just lets her go. He has made exactly one choice for himself all season, and when fate inexplicably decides to reward his ambition-bereft behavior by reuniting him with the one woman he's been saving himself for, he displays all the passion of a box of Wheat Thins. I can hate Doi, but I can't feel anything about Reito. He is blankness incarnate. He is an absence. He is a void emptier than the ones that attach themselves to any exposed nipple.    Ultimately, I can't recommend World’s End Harem even as an ironic pleasure. There was no chance for it to be sexy, and even less chance for it to be good, so absurdity was pretty much the only thing going for it. And there's just not enough ridiculousness spread over eleven episodes to make World’s End Harem overall worthwhile. There were moments, to be sure. I had a blast with a handful of episodes, and the particularities of reviewing a piece of hot garbage weekly made my experience a bit more fun and rewarding than it otherwise would have been. I cannot, however, justify a universal recommendation. There's better trash out there. You deserve better trash. Let me take this one for the team, and I'm taking it straight to the incinerator.

The whole industry is in a slow and excruciating freefall thanks to production bloat, and even most high-profile shows struggle to put episodes together these days, so bottom feeders like World’s End Harem really have no chance. However, if there wasn't time to animate the mouths, they should have gone avant-garde and used the censors to cover them up. At least that would have been funny and tongue-in-cheek instead of just bad.    And speaking of things that are bad, Doi's material remains the worst, most navel-gazing component of a series that didn't really have much going for it in the first place. This term didn't exist in the online lexicon when the anime began, but as a creative work inexorably tethered to both its text and subtext, World’s End Harem is the dictionary definition of “maidenless behavior.” Doi lives out the pathetic and unimaginative power fantasy of the specific strain of virgin obsessed with their own virginity to the point of embittered entitlement. This comes to a laughable head when Karen uses science magic to both age him up and cure his eyesight, physically completing his transition from “loser” to “chad,” as if his arc weren't blatant enough. Literally all of his problems have been solved by fucking women like they're entirely disposable. He kept a girl chained up in his bedroom, and now he is the only man on the planet legally allowed to plow. And despite everything, he's still too much of a nerd to be affably evil, which has been the sole unintentionally redeeming factor of his story. The writing is simply too incompetent to make him cool. He's just a pathetic husk wrapped around a contradictory collage of toxic masculine ideals. A caricature in the guise of a champion. The Ozymandias of orgasms.    The UW takes a backseat to all this, which is unfortunate, because while it has emerged as the most offensive part of the show (excluding Doi), it's also now the most interesting. I want to know more about this secret man-hating triumvirate who managed to engineer the worst act of bioterrorism in history but also cannot muster the competency to kill five below-average men. I want to know more about Chloe's dedicated lesbian BDSM room. I want to see Karen deliver a nationwide address as prime minister while looking and sounding exactly the way she does now. Like, hopefully I don't have to explain why conflating feminism with hating men, and then further conflating hating men with total androcide is disingenuous at best. World’s End Harem's dog-whistling really wants you to be impressed with it, as if it's the very first narrative in history brave enough to consider that killing off all men would be a little bit fucked up. It can't even be bothered to be creative with its misogyny.    Credit where it's due, there is one character beat in this finale that I genuinely liked: Kyoji deciding to stay behind so he can be with all of the women he knocked up. The way it's presented is very funny, showing us a collage of photo ops featuring smiling Kyojis and a smattering of different pregnant woman, but it's also kinda sweet as well. It might be the one altruistic thing anyone has ever done in this show. And furthermore, Kyoji's determination provides a great contrast to Reito's spinelessness. Once more, our supposed protagonist does nothing but get dragged around by the proactive women who surround him. He has a chance to take Mira with him—not to screw her, as she suggests, but to fight and do something to pull her away from the obviously evil UW—yet he just lets her go. He has made exactly one choice for himself all season, and when fate inexplicably decides to reward his ambition-bereft behavior by reuniting him with the one woman he's been saving himself for, he displays all the passion of a box of Wheat Thins. I can hate Doi, but I can't feel anything about Reito. He is blankness incarnate. He is an absence. He is a void emptier than the ones that attach themselves to any exposed nipple.    Ultimately, I can't recommend World’s End Harem even as an ironic pleasure. There was no chance for it to be sexy, and even less chance for it to be good, so absurdity was pretty much the only thing going for it. And there's just not enough ridiculousness spread over eleven episodes to make World’s End Harem overall worthwhile. There were moments, to be sure. I had a blast with a handful of episodes, and the particularities of reviewing a piece of hot garbage weekly made my experience a bit more fun and rewarding than it otherwise would have been. I cannot, however, justify a universal recommendation. There's better trash out there. You deserve better trash. Let me take this one for the team, and I'm taking it straight to the incinerator.    Rating:                 World’s End Harem is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.    Steve can be found on Twitter if you want to read his World’s End Harem livetweets.

Community score: 2.0           After eleven weeks of flaunting digitally-scorched sexual conquests wearing flimsy sci-fi conspiracy negligee, World’s End Harem ends with a little more banging, but mostly with a lot of pathetic whimpers. Limping and tumbling on its way to the finish line, the episode can barely hold itself together, and it's all in the service of a nonconclusion that does little to tie off any threads and even less to whet the audience's appetite for more. Even the most diehard Doi stans will have to admit this finale is garbage. It's an embarrassing note to end on, and for World’s End Harem, that's the perfect curtain call.    There's no point digging into the plot. It's a confused and purely perfunctory mess that, after twenty minutes, just amounts to reuniting Reito with Erisa—and they don't even kiss! Rather, the unmissable hallmark of this episode is how unfinished it is. World’s End Harem never looked good to begin with, but even those scant corners it possessed are sliced into oblivion here.

Review   by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 28th 2022       Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me GN 1                      Synopsis:               One day on her way to school, Marika Uruuno turns a corner to find her two best friends kissing each other. Though shocked to see this come out of nowhere, she begins to look around and notice two things. The first is that there are a lot more openly intimate girl couples around her then she remembers while the other is that she can't find a single male anywhere. It seems as though Marika has wandered into a world where men no longer exist, either being replaced with women lookalikes or just removed all together.    In a panic, Marika heads to the nurse's office to calm down. There she meets Lily Kazami, who is reading a book on parallel universes. Although she is ignored at first, Marika ends up telling Lily about her bizarre situation. Setting aside her disbelief, Lily offers to assist Marika on the condition that they go out together. Will they find answers to such a ludicrous scenario and will a romance between these two blossom along the way?

Although she is ignored at first, Marika ends up telling Lily about her bizarre situation. Setting aside her disbelief, Lily offers to assist Marika on the condition that they go out together. Will they find answers to such a ludicrous scenario and will a romance between these two blossom along the way?      Review:            I must say, the title and initial premise of this two-volume series did have me wondering just how much the story would fall back on gay panic or other stereotypes for the sake of cheap comedy or fanservice. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how seriously the manga took itself, and that the inciting incident wasn't just an excuse to create an otherworldly comedic situation. Beneath the ridiculousness of The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri's premise – waking up one day to suddenly find that all the women of the world have become lesbians since men died off hundreds of years ago – is a genuine attempt at creating a narrative arc for our main characters, complete with a climax which seeks to resolve all loose ends. The question, then, is whether or not said attempt resulted in an engaging story. And I think it has, despite the fact that the manga doesn't always know the best way to stick the landing.    The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me starts off with a surprising amount of self-awareness as it introduces our main character Marika to a far more gay version of her life than she is used to. Predictably, no one believes her when she says that she is from another world, but then a girl named Lily decides to humor her, kickstarting a sci-fi mystery story about parallel worlds and questions about identity. Throw in some romantic drama and you have some pretty standard building blocks that at times mesh together surprisingly well. The story is self-aware about the ridiculousness of its premise;  Marika's claims of being from another world are met with surprisingly realistic reactions from other characters especially since, from their perspective, she's always been a part of this world and her suddenly talking about men runs right in the face of their own reality. Our two leads are very proactive despite their quirks and the story never really loses momentum throughout the two volumes; it has a very straightforward approach of getting its readers from point A to point B while still managing to work in moments of quiet introspection from our leads.    Themes of feeling out of place, feeling lost, and trying to figure out where your feelings for someone might come from are well-integrated into the story. When Marika goes on about how she never really fit in or how her private life seemed disjointed, it works both as a relatable character moment and a well-foreshadowed plot point. Lilly's characterization is a bit more standard, but no less genuine, especially since she carries a sense of desperation that only grows as the story progresses. These two have great chemistry together and while their banter can feel a bit cliché, the rest of their character interactions are capable of evoking both humor and emotional pathos.    This is in no small part thanks to the manga's artwork, which is an absolute highlight. Not only are the designs of our two leads distinct, but they also perfectly contrast with each other to reflect their differing personalities. There are some impressive panel layouts that help carry the emotional weight of certain scenes, and the manga's use of shading different variations of black or gray do wonders in setting up a scene. While a lot of the side characters do feel a bit lazy comparatively in their design, it's clear the artist knew what parts needed the most attention in order to convey what a character was feeling at any moment. The result is a manga that's very immersive; I would almost be tempted to recommend the manga just based on the artwork and fun main character interactions alone. Unfortunately, there are some major hiccups to the plotting that hold the manga back.    The author's decision to treat their story's premise with an air of seriousness and urgency means that they couldn't rely on any superficial or shallow resolutions. While the first third of this massive volume is strong and does a good job of setting up the mystery on top of some nice character moments between our two leads, when it comes time for the narrative to start progressing towards a definitive conclusion, you can feel the author buckling under the weight. There is an attempt to imbue a sense of logic to the circumstances that led to the manga's inciting incident, and while the theories discussed can be fun (if a little routine), the way in which we are given this information gets lazier as the book goes on, and new characters are introduced simply as plot devices to further the narrative without any real connection to anything else.    I could forgive these contrivances if didn't start affecting the aforementioned character interactions that I found so enjoyable. The story starts over-explaining where characters are and why they might feel the way that they do, as if every circumstance needed to happen for a reason that relates back to the main plot in some way. It all feels like the author had an intended ending in mind but attempted to prolong the story by adding additional details and revelations along the way, which can be exhausting to read. It genuinely became harder to appreciate some of the manga's better qualities because its plotting is so ingrained in how we get to those moments. Trying to come up with a plot-related reason for everything would only result in a story that's less believable overall. If the author just pulled back some of these twists and revelations, it might've led to more loose ends, but it would've definitely resulted in a more emotionally-fulfilling story.    To sum up, The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me was an interesting read that definitely had more to it than I originally thought. However, more doesn't always necessarily mean better. While the artwork is gorgeous and the character interactions between the leads start out believable, the story is too loaded with ideas and revelations to really appreciate them. To get a complete story in this massive volume is a good deal. However, you may end up walking away scratching your head instead of wanting more. I stand by what I said at the beginning of this review that there is an interesting story buried beneath this premise – I just don't think the author managed to tell it well.             Grade:      Overall : B- Story : C Art : A-  + Gorgeous artwork, strong start with believable character interactions and character reflections − Massive contrivances and over-explaining makes the plotting feel exhausting while also dragging down the genuine character interactions            discuss this in the forum (13 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Hiroki Haruse   Full encyclopedia details aboutWhole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          39 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 39 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Review   by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 28th 2022       Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me GN 1                      Synopsis:               One day on her way to school, Marika Uruuno turns a corner to find her two best friends kissing each other. Though shocked to see this come out of nowhere, she begins to look around and notice two things. The first is that there are a lot more openly intimate girl couples around her then she remembers while the other is that she can't find a single male anywhere. It seems as though Marika has wandered into a world where men no longer exist, either being replaced with women lookalikes or just removed all together.    In a panic, Marika heads to the nurse's office to calm down. There she meets Lily Kazami, who is reading a book on parallel universes. Although she is ignored at first, Marika ends up telling Lily about her bizarre situation. Setting aside her disbelief, Lily offers to assist Marika on the condition that they go out together. Will they find answers to such a ludicrous scenario and will a romance between these two blossom along the way?

Although she is ignored at first, Marika ends up telling Lily about her bizarre situation. Setting aside her disbelief, Lily offers to assist Marika on the condition that they go out together. Will they find answers to such a ludicrous scenario and will a romance between these two blossom along the way?      Review:            I must say, the title and initial premise of this two-volume series did have me wondering just how much the story would fall back on gay panic or other stereotypes for the sake of cheap comedy or fanservice. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how seriously the manga took itself, and that the inciting incident wasn't just an excuse to create an otherworldly comedic situation. Beneath the ridiculousness of The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri's premise – waking up one day to suddenly find that all the women of the world have become lesbians since men died off hundreds of years ago – is a genuine attempt at creating a narrative arc for our main characters, complete with a climax which seeks to resolve all loose ends. The question, then, is whether or not said attempt resulted in an engaging story. And I think it has, despite the fact that the manga doesn't always know the best way to stick the landing.    The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me starts off with a surprising amount of self-awareness as it introduces our main character Marika to a far more gay version of her life than she is used to. Predictably, no one believes her when she says that she is from another world, but then a girl named Lily decides to humor her, kickstarting a sci-fi mystery story about parallel worlds and questions about identity. Throw in some romantic drama and you have some pretty standard building blocks that at times mesh together surprisingly well. The story is self-aware about the ridiculousness of its premise;  Marika's claims of being from another world are met with surprisingly realistic reactions from other characters especially since, from their perspective, she's always been a part of this world and her suddenly talking about men runs right in the face of their own reality. Our two leads are very proactive despite their quirks and the story never really loses momentum throughout the two volumes; it has a very straightforward approach of getting its readers from point A to point B while still managing to work in moments of quiet introspection from our leads.    Themes of feeling out of place, feeling lost, and trying to figure out where your feelings for someone might come from are well-integrated into the story. When Marika goes on about how she never really fit in or how her private life seemed disjointed, it works both as a relatable character moment and a well-foreshadowed plot point. Lilly's characterization is a bit more standard, but no less genuine, especially since she carries a sense of desperation that only grows as the story progresses. These two have great chemistry together and while their banter can feel a bit cliché, the rest of their character interactions are capable of evoking both humor and emotional pathos.    This is in no small part thanks to the manga's artwork, which is an absolute highlight. Not only are the designs of our two leads distinct, but they also perfectly contrast with each other to reflect their differing personalities. There are some impressive panel layouts that help carry the emotional weight of certain scenes, and the manga's use of shading different variations of black or gray do wonders in setting up a scene. While a lot of the side characters do feel a bit lazy comparatively in their design, it's clear the artist knew what parts needed the most attention in order to convey what a character was feeling at any moment. The result is a manga that's very immersive; I would almost be tempted to recommend the manga just based on the artwork and fun main character interactions alone. Unfortunately, there are some major hiccups to the plotting that hold the manga back.    The author's decision to treat their story's premise with an air of seriousness and urgency means that they couldn't rely on any superficial or shallow resolutions. While the first third of this massive volume is strong and does a good job of setting up the mystery on top of some nice character moments between our two leads, when it comes time for the narrative to start progressing towards a definitive conclusion, you can feel the author buckling under the weight. There is an attempt to imbue a sense of logic to the circumstances that led to the manga's inciting incident, and while the theories discussed can be fun (if a little routine), the way in which we are given this information gets lazier as the book goes on, and new characters are introduced simply as plot devices to further the narrative without any real connection to anything else.    I could forgive these contrivances if didn't start affecting the aforementioned character interactions that I found so enjoyable. The story starts over-explaining where characters are and why they might feel the way that they do, as if every circumstance needed to happen for a reason that relates back to the main plot in some way. It all feels like the author had an intended ending in mind but attempted to prolong the story by adding additional details and revelations along the way, which can be exhausting to read. It genuinely became harder to appreciate some of the manga's better qualities because its plotting is so ingrained in how we get to those moments. Trying to come up with a plot-related reason for everything would only result in a story that's less believable overall. If the author just pulled back some of these twists and revelations, it might've led to more loose ends, but it would've definitely resulted in a more emotionally-fulfilling story.    To sum up, The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me was an interesting read that definitely had more to it than I originally thought. However, more doesn't always necessarily mean better. While the artwork is gorgeous and the character interactions between the leads start out believable, the story is too loaded with ideas and revelations to really appreciate them. To get a complete story in this massive volume is a good deal. However, you may end up walking away scratching your head instead of wanting more. I stand by what I said at the beginning of this review that there is an interesting story buried beneath this premise – I just don't think the author managed to tell it well.             Grade:      Overall : B- Story : C Art : A-  + Gorgeous artwork, strong start with believable character interactions and character reflections − Massive contrivances and over-explaining makes the plotting feel exhausting while also dragging down the genuine character interactions            discuss this in the forum (13 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Hiroki Haruse   Full encyclopedia details aboutWhole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          39 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 39 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Review   by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 28th 2022       Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me GN 1                      Synopsis:               One day on her way to school, Marika Uruuno turns a corner to find her two best friends kissing each other. Though shocked to see this come out of nowhere, she begins to look around and notice two things. The first is that there are a lot more openly intimate girl couples around her then she remembers while the other is that she can't find a single male anywhere. It seems as though Marika has wandered into a world where men no longer exist, either being replaced with women lookalikes or just removed all together.    In a panic, Marika heads to the nurse's office to calm down. There she meets Lily Kazami, who is reading a book on parallel universes. Although she is ignored at first, Marika ends up telling Lily about her bizarre situation. Setting aside her disbelief, Lily offers to assist Marika on the condition that they go out together. Will they find answers to such a ludicrous scenario and will a romance between these two blossom along the way?

Although she is ignored at first, Marika ends up telling Lily about her bizarre situation. Setting aside her disbelief, Lily offers to assist Marika on the condition that they go out together. Will they find answers to such a ludicrous scenario and will a romance between these two blossom along the way?      Review:            I must say, the title and initial premise of this two-volume series did have me wondering just how much the story would fall back on gay panic or other stereotypes for the sake of cheap comedy or fanservice. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how seriously the manga took itself, and that the inciting incident wasn't just an excuse to create an otherworldly comedic situation. Beneath the ridiculousness of The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri's premise – waking up one day to suddenly find that all the women of the world have become lesbians since men died off hundreds of years ago – is a genuine attempt at creating a narrative arc for our main characters, complete with a climax which seeks to resolve all loose ends. The question, then, is whether or not said attempt resulted in an engaging story. And I think it has, despite the fact that the manga doesn't always know the best way to stick the landing.    The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me starts off with a surprising amount of self-awareness as it introduces our main character Marika to a far more gay version of her life than she is used to. Predictably, no one believes her when she says that she is from another world, but then a girl named Lily decides to humor her, kickstarting a sci-fi mystery story about parallel worlds and questions about identity. Throw in some romantic drama and you have some pretty standard building blocks that at times mesh together surprisingly well. The story is self-aware about the ridiculousness of its premise;  Marika's claims of being from another world are met with surprisingly realistic reactions from other characters especially since, from their perspective, she's always been a part of this world and her suddenly talking about men runs right in the face of their own reality. Our two leads are very proactive despite their quirks and the story never really loses momentum throughout the two volumes; it has a very straightforward approach of getting its readers from point A to point B while still managing to work in moments of quiet introspection from our leads.    Themes of feeling out of place, feeling lost, and trying to figure out where your feelings for someone might come from are well-integrated into the story. When Marika goes on about how she never really fit in or how her private life seemed disjointed, it works both as a relatable character moment and a well-foreshadowed plot point. Lilly's characterization is a bit more standard, but no less genuine, especially since she carries a sense of desperation that only grows as the story progresses. These two have great chemistry together and while their banter can feel a bit cliché, the rest of their character interactions are capable of evoking both humor and emotional pathos.    This is in no small part thanks to the manga's artwork, which is an absolute highlight. Not only are the designs of our two leads distinct, but they also perfectly contrast with each other to reflect their differing personalities. There are some impressive panel layouts that help carry the emotional weight of certain scenes, and the manga's use of shading different variations of black or gray do wonders in setting up a scene. While a lot of the side characters do feel a bit lazy comparatively in their design, it's clear the artist knew what parts needed the most attention in order to convey what a character was feeling at any moment. The result is a manga that's very immersive; I would almost be tempted to recommend the manga just based on the artwork and fun main character interactions alone. Unfortunately, there are some major hiccups to the plotting that hold the manga back.    The author's decision to treat their story's premise with an air of seriousness and urgency means that they couldn't rely on any superficial or shallow resolutions. While the first third of this massive volume is strong and does a good job of setting up the mystery on top of some nice character moments between our two leads, when it comes time for the narrative to start progressing towards a definitive conclusion, you can feel the author buckling under the weight. There is an attempt to imbue a sense of logic to the circumstances that led to the manga's inciting incident, and while the theories discussed can be fun (if a little routine), the way in which we are given this information gets lazier as the book goes on, and new characters are introduced simply as plot devices to further the narrative without any real connection to anything else.    I could forgive these contrivances if didn't start affecting the aforementioned character interactions that I found so enjoyable. The story starts over-explaining where characters are and why they might feel the way that they do, as if every circumstance needed to happen for a reason that relates back to the main plot in some way. It all feels like the author had an intended ending in mind but attempted to prolong the story by adding additional details and revelations along the way, which can be exhausting to read. It genuinely became harder to appreciate some of the manga's better qualities because its plotting is so ingrained in how we get to those moments. Trying to come up with a plot-related reason for everything would only result in a story that's less believable overall. If the author just pulled back some of these twists and revelations, it might've led to more loose ends, but it would've definitely resulted in a more emotionally-fulfilling story.    To sum up, The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me was an interesting read that definitely had more to it than I originally thought. However, more doesn't always necessarily mean better. While the artwork is gorgeous and the character interactions between the leads start out believable, the story is too loaded with ideas and revelations to really appreciate them. To get a complete story in this massive volume is a good deal. However, you may end up walking away scratching your head instead of wanting more. I stand by what I said at the beginning of this review that there is an interesting story buried beneath this premise – I just don't think the author managed to tell it well.             Grade:      Overall : B- Story : C Art : A-  + Gorgeous artwork, strong start with believable character interactions and character reflections − Massive contrivances and over-explaining makes the plotting feel exhausting while also dragging down the genuine character interactions            discuss this in the forum (13 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Hiroki Haruse   Full encyclopedia details aboutWhole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          39 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 39 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Review   by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 28th 2022       Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me GN 1                      Synopsis:               One day on her way to school, Marika Uruuno turns a corner to find her two best friends kissing each other. Though shocked to see this come out of nowhere, she begins to look around and notice two things. The first is that there are a lot more openly intimate girl couples around her then she remembers while the other is that she can't find a single male anywhere. It seems as though Marika has wandered into a world where men no longer exist, either being replaced with women lookalikes or just removed all together.    In a panic, Marika heads to the nurse's office to calm down. There she meets Lily Kazami, who is reading a book on parallel universes. Although she is ignored at first, Marika ends up telling Lily about her bizarre situation. Setting aside her disbelief, Lily offers to assist Marika on the condition that they go out together. Will they find answers to such a ludicrous scenario and will a romance between these two blossom along the way?

The first is that there are a lot more openly intimate girl couples around her then she remembers while the other is that she can't find a single male anywhere.

Although she is ignored at first, Marika ends up telling Lily about her bizarre situation. Setting aside her disbelief, Lily offers to assist Marika on the condition that they go out together. Will they find answers to such a ludicrous scenario and will a romance between these two blossom along the way?      Review:            I must say, the title and initial premise of this two-volume series did have me wondering just how much the story would fall back on gay panic or other stereotypes for the sake of cheap comedy or fanservice. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how seriously the manga took itself, and that the inciting incident wasn't just an excuse to create an otherworldly comedic situation. Beneath the ridiculousness of The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri's premise – waking up one day to suddenly find that all the women of the world have become lesbians since men died off hundreds of years ago – is a genuine attempt at creating a narrative arc for our main characters, complete with a climax which seeks to resolve all loose ends. The question, then, is whether or not said attempt resulted in an engaging story. And I think it has, despite the fact that the manga doesn't always know the best way to stick the landing.    The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me starts off with a surprising amount of self-awareness as it introduces our main character Marika to a far more gay version of her life than she is used to. Predictably, no one believes her when she says that she is from another world, but then a girl named Lily decides to humor her, kickstarting a sci-fi mystery story about parallel worlds and questions about identity. Throw in some romantic drama and you have some pretty standard building blocks that at times mesh together surprisingly well. The story is self-aware about the ridiculousness of its premise;  Marika's claims of being from another world are met with surprisingly realistic reactions from other characters especially since, from their perspective, she's always been a part of this world and her suddenly talking about men runs right in the face of their own reality. Our two leads are very proactive despite their quirks and the story never really loses momentum throughout the two volumes; it has a very straightforward approach of getting its readers from point A to point B while still managing to work in moments of quiet introspection from our leads.    Themes of feeling out of place, feeling lost, and trying to figure out where your feelings for someone might come from are well-integrated into the story. When Marika goes on about how she never really fit in or how her private life seemed disjointed, it works both as a relatable character moment and a well-foreshadowed plot point. Lilly's characterization is a bit more standard, but no less genuine, especially since she carries a sense of desperation that only grows as the story progresses. These two have great chemistry together and while their banter can feel a bit cliché, the rest of their character interactions are capable of evoking both humor and emotional pathos.    This is in no small part thanks to the manga's artwork, which is an absolute highlight. Not only are the designs of our two leads distinct, but they also perfectly contrast with each other to reflect their differing personalities. There are some impressive panel layouts that help carry the emotional weight of certain scenes, and the manga's use of shading different variations of black or gray do wonders in setting up a scene. While a lot of the side characters do feel a bit lazy comparatively in their design, it's clear the artist knew what parts needed the most attention in order to convey what a character was feeling at any moment. The result is a manga that's very immersive; I would almost be tempted to recommend the manga just based on the artwork and fun main character interactions alone. Unfortunately, there are some major hiccups to the plotting that hold the manga back.    The author's decision to treat their story's premise with an air of seriousness and urgency means that they couldn't rely on any superficial or shallow resolutions. While the first third of this massive volume is strong and does a good job of setting up the mystery on top of some nice character moments between our two leads, when it comes time for the narrative to start progressing towards a definitive conclusion, you can feel the author buckling under the weight. There is an attempt to imbue a sense of logic to the circumstances that led to the manga's inciting incident, and while the theories discussed can be fun (if a little routine), the way in which we are given this information gets lazier as the book goes on, and new characters are introduced simply as plot devices to further the narrative without any real connection to anything else.    I could forgive these contrivances if didn't start affecting the aforementioned character interactions that I found so enjoyable. The story starts over-explaining where characters are and why they might feel the way that they do, as if every circumstance needed to happen for a reason that relates back to the main plot in some way. It all feels like the author had an intended ending in mind but attempted to prolong the story by adding additional details and revelations along the way, which can be exhausting to read. It genuinely became harder to appreciate some of the manga's better qualities because its plotting is so ingrained in how we get to those moments. Trying to come up with a plot-related reason for everything would only result in a story that's less believable overall. If the author just pulled back some of these twists and revelations, it might've led to more loose ends, but it would've definitely resulted in a more emotionally-fulfilling story.    To sum up, The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me was an interesting read that definitely had more to it than I originally thought. However, more doesn't always necessarily mean better. While the artwork is gorgeous and the character interactions between the leads start out believable, the story is too loaded with ideas and revelations to really appreciate them. To get a complete story in this massive volume is a good deal. However, you may end up walking away scratching your head instead of wanting more. I stand by what I said at the beginning of this review that there is an interesting story buried beneath this premise – I just don't think the author managed to tell it well.             Grade:      Overall : B- Story : C Art : A-  + Gorgeous artwork, strong start with believable character interactions and character reflections − Massive contrivances and over-explaining makes the plotting feel exhausting while also dragging down the genuine character interactions            discuss this in the forum (13 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Hiroki Haruse   Full encyclopedia details aboutWhole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          39 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 39 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!
