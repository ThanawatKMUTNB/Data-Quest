The following contains spoilers for Tomodachi Game Episode 1, ""Huh? Yuichi-kun Suspects His Friends?,"" now streaming on Crunchyroll.   High-stakes games have become a commonplace narrative in anime, video games and live-action shows. Many of the most popular of these titles pit complete strangers against each other in a series of deadly competitions or some sort of mutual killing battle royale. Tomodachi Game, one of this season's newest suspense series, delivers a similar structure by forcing high schoolers to play games with each other's fates on the line.  However, in comparison to many of its contemporaries, Tomodachi Game has two big differences. First, rather than the characters wagering their survival, they risk their futures in the form of life-ruining debt. Second, the participants are all people that they believed to be their best friends. RELATED: How Tokyo Revengers Really Compares to Tokyo Ghoul The series opens with the unassuming protagonist Yuuichi Katakiri and his tight-knit student friend group. This posse consists of the carefree rich boy Makoto Shibe, the stern vice class representative Shiho Sawaragi, the prodigious smart guy Tenji Mikasa and the caring wallflower Yutori Kokorogi. While the five share a deep bond, suspicion arises around them after two million yen is stolen from the class' school trip funds.  Following this incident, all five of them receive a letter in the middle of the night to meet at the school, at which point they are accosted and kidnapped. After waking up in a bleached white room, they are informed by Manabu-kun, an eerie childlike mascot character, that they must play a series of games to pay off a 20 million yen sum -- a debt that supposedly belongs to one of them. Although Yuuichi initially doubts the reality of the setup, he is shocked when the other four quickly accede to these demands. His horror is further reinforced by Manabu-kun's mention of an entry fee paid by the debtor equal to the exact amount stolen from the class.                  It is this looming sense of secrecy that creates a unique tension to the elements of Tomodachi Game. The anime masterfully conveys the events from Yuuichi's perspective alone, secluding audiences from the other four in the same way that Yuuichi himself is during the games. All five of them become equally saddled with the divided debt at the start of the contest, despite only one of them being responsible for its existence. Furthermore, the activities are structured in such a way that the amount owed by each character can go up or down based on their actions but is never verified by another participant.  RELATED: Chainsaw Man, Look Back Creator Announces New Feature-Length Manga The first game, based on Kokkuri-san -- the Japanese equivalent of a ouija board -- makes the players communally answer a series of yes-or-no questions by moving a coin around without talking. The board itself, programmed to move in the direction of the minority answer, initially seems to be a largely innocuous hurdle. Still, once the seemingly simple questions come back consistently incorrect, it seems like sabotage may be the only explanation.                 Many viewers have compared the show to death game series like Alice in Borderland or Squid Game. The latter parallel appears particularly apt due to the promise of prize money to settle a massive debt. Additionally, Squid Game's bouts for survival are largely based around childhood pastimes. Tomodachi Game's Kokkuri-san certainly fits the bill for that genre of activity, as does the presence of the unsettling Manabu-kun, who comes from a kid's anime within the world of Tomodachi Game.  RELATED: Spy x Family Is Japan's Most Anticipated New Anime Nevertheless, it is the relationship of the competitors that drives the pain of the scenario home. One would expect to be cast aside by rivals in a game where none of the members know each other. In contrast, Tomodachi Game attacks its characters' emotional foundation by confronting them with the reality of a traitor among their dearest friends. Likewise, by making the contest about money rather than death, it places them in a situation where the consequences are more morally gray. While the debt may be a dire consequence, it's much easier to force that upon a friend than it is to condemn them to death.                  That being said, there is no telling where future matches will take the group. The show has already revealed a shadowy organization behind the scenes, analyzing their every move. Should the five make it past this first round, they may be forced to wager more than just money as the limits of their bonds are tested. But no matter what comes of their collective trials, it's clear that the relationship between Yuuichi and his friends will never be the same again.

10-04-2022,anime,3,0,https://www.cbr.com/tomodachi-game-squid-game-anime-version/,Tomodachi Game Is the Anime Version of Squid Game,"      Home Anime Tomodachi Game Is the Anime Version of Squid Game - With a Twist    Tomodachi Game Is the Anime Version of Squid Game - With a Twist  By Chris Nishijima Published 20 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   The risks of this competition may not initially start out as fatal, but the series' theme of mistrust among friends has a relatable intensity.                  The following contains spoilers for Tomodachi Game Episode 1, ""Huh? Yuichi-kun Suspects His Friends?,"" now streaming on Crunchyroll.   High-stakes games have become a commonplace narrative in anime, video games and live-action shows. Many of the most popular of these titles pit complete strangers against each other in a series of deadly competitions or some sort of mutual killing battle royale. Tomodachi Game, one of this season's newest suspense series, delivers a similar structure by forcing high schoolers to play games with each other's fates on the line.  However, in comparison to many of its contemporaries, Tomodachi Game has two big differences. First, rather than the characters wagering their survival, they risk their futures in the form of life-ruining debt. Second, the participants are all people that they believed to be their best friends. RELATED: How Tokyo Revengers Really Compares to Tokyo Ghoul The series opens with the unassuming protagonist Yuuichi Katakiri and his tight-knit student friend group. This posse consists of the carefree rich boy Makoto Shibe, the stern vice class representative Shiho Sawaragi, the prodigious smart guy Tenji Mikasa and the caring wallflower Yutori Kokorogi. While the five share a deep bond, suspicion arises around them after two million yen is stolen from the class' school trip funds.  Following this incident, all five of them receive a letter in the middle of the night to meet at the school, at which point they are accosted and kidnapped. After waking up in a bleached white room, they are informed by Manabu-kun, an eerie childlike mascot character, that they must play a series of games to pay off a 20 million yen sum -- a debt that supposedly belongs to one of them. Although Yuuichi initially doubts the reality of the setup, he is shocked when the other four quickly accede to these demands. His horror is further reinforced by Manabu-kun's mention of an entry fee paid by the debtor equal to the exact amount stolen from the class.                  It is this looming sense of secrecy that creates a unique tension to the elements of Tomodachi Game. The anime masterfully conveys the events from Yuuichi's perspective alone, secluding audiences from the other four in the same way that Yuuichi himself is during the games. All five of them become equally saddled with the divided debt at the start of the contest, despite only one of them being responsible for its existence. Furthermore, the activities are structured in such a way that the amount owed by each character can go up or down based on their actions but is never verified by another participant.  RELATED: Chainsaw Man, Look Back Creator Announces New Feature-Length Manga The first game, based on Kokkuri-san -- the Japanese equivalent of a ouija board -- makes the players communally answer a series of yes-or-no questions by moving a coin around without talking. The board itself, programmed to move in the direction of the minority answer, initially seems to be a largely innocuous hurdle. Still, once the seemingly simple questions come back consistently incorrect, it seems like sabotage may be the only explanation.                 Many viewers have compared the show to death game series like Alice in Borderland or Squid Game. The latter parallel appears particularly apt due to the promise of prize money to settle a massive debt. Additionally, Squid Game's bouts for survival are largely based around childhood pastimes. Tomodachi Game's Kokkuri-san certainly fits the bill for that genre of activity, as does the presence of the unsettling Manabu-kun, who comes from a kid's anime within the world of Tomodachi Game.  RELATED: Spy x Family Is Japan's Most Anticipated New Anime Nevertheless, it is the relationship of the competitors that drives the pain of the scenario home. One would expect to be cast aside by rivals in a game where none of the members know each other. In contrast, Tomodachi Game attacks its characters' emotional foundation by confronting them with the reality of a traitor among their dearest friends. Likewise, by making the contest about money rather than death, it places them in a situation where the consequences are more morally gray. While the debt may be a dire consequence, it's much easier to force that upon a friend than it is to condemn them to death.                  That being said, there is no telling where future matches will take the group. The show has already revealed a shadowy organization behind the scenes, analyzing their every move. Should the five make it past this first round, they may be forced to wager more than just money as the limits of their bonds are tested. But no matter what comes of their collective trials, it's clear that the relationship between Yuuichi and his friends will never be the same again.

Fans of the up-and-coming shonen manga Chainsaw Man are in for a surprise with Chapter 59. Readers attempting to use the Shonen Jump app to read the latest chapter are with a disclaimer: ""Chapter 59 of Chainsaw Man is 18+ and viewable on the website only."" Prevsious chapters had been appropriate for younger readers, so why the sudden restriction?  Chainsaw Man follows Denji, a destitute young man that fuses his heart with a type of monster called a Devil. In doing so, he gains the ability to sprout functioning chainsaws from his head and arms. However, he also loses all of his human rights and is forced to become a government Devil hunter or else be exterminated. Chainsaw Man has a track record of being graphically bloody and explicit. As a title, it has never shied away from gory or sexual content. It's almost a feature of the story, as the sheltered Denji discovers that the people around him are just as messed up as he is. RELATED: Chainsaw Man Puts a Bloody Spin on Adventure Time’s Finn & Jake                 The scene that likely makes Chainsaw Man Chapter 59 ""web-only"" involves a recently introduced character named Quanxi. Currently, not much is known about her except for the fact that she's Chinese, upsettingly powerful and has a harem of Devil girls. Quanxi and a slew of other Devil hunters have traveled to Japan in a bid to kill Denji, though Quanxi seems to be procrastinating by spending time with her girls. The opening pages of Chapter 59 feature the hunter and the Devil girls, fully naked -- albeit with strategically covered lady parts -- and in the middle of a five-person orgy. And it's a two-page spread.  RELATED: First Dragon Ball English Dub Episode By Harmony Gold Is Now Online Even for Chainsaw Man, the scene is pretty intense for the normally tween-friendly Shonen Jump -- hence the move to Viz Media's website. Chainsaw Man is the latest in a range of action titles that delve into the explicit for thematic potency. Series like Kaneshiro Muneyuki's Jagaaaaan or Yuji Kaku's Hell's Paradise: Jigokuraku -- another Jump series -- use harsh violence and explicit sexual situations to make points about the worlds their characters live in. And, though it's not a shonen title, another classic example of this would be Kentaro Miura's Berserk, infamous for its extremely graphic disposition.  While moving a chapter from app to site is certainly better than outright censorship, this situation is a gentle reminder that these titles don't exist in a vacuum, though many of us read them in one. They are part of a larger whole, and so still have to consider any audience that might stumble onto them.

WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan: The Final Season - Part 2.A talented fan of Hajime Isayama's Attack on Titan used special effects to transform himself into one of the series' titular monsters and then... ate himself.  Posted on the ProductionCrate YouTube channel, the creator, who identifies himself as Mike, walks viewers through the process of how he created the Titan-version of himself. He covers the many steps, including creating a 3D model of his head, the necessary color map and the uncanny proportions of the body. The video ends with a sequence of Titan-Mike chasing Human-Mike and biting his head off. While there is no blood, the sound effects give the action a gruesome, evocative edge. RELATED: Attack on Titan: Mikasa and Annie Debate Killing Eren in Exclusive Final Season Clip    Attack of Titan is set in a post-apocalyptic world where humans hide from Titans -- giant, man-eating monsters -- in walled cities. The story focuses primarily on Eren Yeager, a young man who desires to destroy all Titans after one devours his mother. While early parts of the narrative appear to frame Eren as the hero, towards the end, he transitions to a full-blown, genocidal villain.  The Attack on Titan manga series was published in Kodansha's Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from 2009 to 2021, and it won several prominent awards, including Best Shōnen Manga at the Kodansha Manga Awards in 2011. The story was adapted into an anime with the first season premiering in 2013. Wit Studio produced the first three seasons and MAPPA is creating the fourth and final season. RELATED: Attack on Titan Cosplayer Recreates Colossal Titan With Household Materials Attack on Titan: The Final Season has been split into multiple parts. Part 1 premiered in December 2020, Part 2 debuted in January 2022 and it was recently revealed that Attack on Titan: The Final Season would return in 2023 for a third part. While this news undoubtedly excited the anime's passionate fans, it wasn't wholly unexpected. Prior to the release of Part 2's finale, many questioned the anime's ability to satisfyingly wrap the story in a single episode.  There have been other developments in the Attack on Titan franchise apart from impressive works of fan-made content and the confirmation of Attack on Titan: The Final Season - Part 3. Most notably, the popular virtual rollercoaster based on the series, Attack on Titan XR Ride, which first ran in 2020, is returning for this year's Universal Cool Japan. The manga series was also one of the featured titles in the launch of MangaPlaza, one of the largest digital libraries in the US. Attack on Titan is available to stream on Netflix, Hulu, Funimation and Crunchyroll.

Home Movies Movie Features The Terrifying Legend That Inspired the Conjuring Universe's The Curse of La Llorona    The Terrifying Legend That Inspired the Conjuring Universe's The Curse of La Llorona  By Michael Li Published 20 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   The sixth entry in The Conjuring franchise, The Curse of La Llorona, is special due to being based on a popular and terrifying Mexican legend                 Much like the other entries in The Conjuring Universe, The Curse of La Llorona is inspired by ""true"" events. However, unlike the other films, this entry is not based on one of Ed and Lorraine Warrens' ghostly adventures but rather on a popular Mexican legend, specifically the tale of La Llorona, otherwise known as ""The Weeping Woman.""  According to the legend, a mother of two children drowns them after witnessing her wealthy husband being unfaithful to her. Racked by guilt, she then drowns herself but is unable to pass into the afterlife. As such, she is cursed to roam the world as a vengeful spirit, dressed in a white wedding gown while constantly wailing. Many claimed to have encountered La Llorona. While some say she kills all who go near her, others believe she only kills children by drowning them. RELATED: Best Horror Films To Watch On Shudder In April 2022                 The legend has its roots as far back as the 19th century in Mexico and parts of Central America. However, early recollections of the legend of La Llorona originated as a woman who was murdered by her husband. As time went by, the legend evolved to include the element of infanticide. Additionally, the legend shares parallels with Aztec, Greek and Hebrew legends that center on themes of fertility and motherhood.  While La Llorona in The Conjuring film franchise may seem similar to the myth counterpart because both wear white wedding gowns and have drowned their children, there are a few noticeable differences. Unlike the traditional legend, which deals with the themes of motherhood and fertility, the La Llorona legend in The Curse of La Llorona seems to be more of a cautionary tale for children not to disobey their parents or wander out too far at night. This is exemplified by children suffering burn marks after La Llorona grabs them by the arm. RELATED: Night's End Flickers With Haunting Promise But Ultimately Fizzles Out                  Additionally, the film introduced a method of bargaining with La Llorona, something not mentioned in the original legend. When Patricia's two sons are killed by La Llorona, Patricia bargains for her children back in exchange for Anna's two children. Besides this never before seen aspect, the film introduces a ritual that can be conducted to protect against La Llorona. However, according to the legend, La Llorona is said to not follow people into their houses or cars. Despite many movie watchers being introduced to La Llorona through the horror film The Curse of La Llorona, the film was actually inspired by a long-standing legend that many children in Mexico, Central America and parts of the southwest United States grew up listening to. While La Llorona herself is most likely not real, her legacy has and will continue to be told to the next generation as both a cautionary tale to stay away from unsafe waters and what it means to be a mother.

The following contains spoilers for Season 2, Episode 1 of The Rising of the Shield Hero, ""A New Roar,"" now streaming on Crunchyroll.   The spring 2022 anime season returns to continue the isekai adventure of The Rising of the Shield Hero's unfortunate protagonist Iwatani Naofumi. By the end of Season 1, however, Naofumi's fortunes had reversed. Now as Season 2 begins, he takes another important step forward by adding a new member to his adventurer party, Rishia, who already has much-needed experience battling the deadly Waves.  However, Rishia comes with her own baggage. Her original party leader, the Bow Hero Itsuki, rejects her as a foolish weakling, so now she clings to Naofumi as her new leader and is desperate to prove herself. Naofumi welcomes Rishia to his party but it won't be easy, and she makes a difficult choice in order to attain more power. RELATED: Meet The Rising of the Shield Hero's Main Characters                Season 2, Episode 1 of Shield Hero finds Naofumi's party working hard to help prepare Lurolona village's defenses for the inevitable next Wave. The tanuki girl Raphtalia feels more prepared for action than ever, and the same is true for Filo. By contrast, the green-haired Rishia struggles to prove her worth, though she does have some talent with controlling her qi energy during a practice session. Suddenly a swarm of oversized bats attacks, and it's up to everyone except Rishia to fight them off.  Rishia feels inadequate compared to everyone around her, and her insecurities mount as she repeatedly fails to fight for Naofumi or impress any of the Cardinal Heroes. She is practically trapped in a vicious cycle of her weak performance undermining her confidence, which in turn destabilizes her performance as an adventurer. This might only get worse as Naofumi's adventure continues, but fortunately for Rishia, her new leader actually looks out for his companions. Raphtalia shares Naofumi's generous spirit and offers to help Rishia power up in time for the next Wave -- but her chosen method may leave a bad taste in some people's mouths, including Naofumi. The party heads to the same well-dressed slave trader in the capital city who had sold Raphtalia to Naofumi months ago, and Raphtalia recommends that Rishia get a slave crest to become a formal -- and stronger -- member of the party. Naofumi objects at first but Rishia insists, so he and the slave trader follow through and add the crest. As hoped, Rishia's stats receive an immediate boost, and Naofumi's RPG-style HUD gets updates on her status. There's no going back now.  RELATED: How Shield Hero Reinvents the Beach Episode Concept, Isekai Style                Rishia's decision to willingly get a slave crest placed on her says a few things about her and Naofumi alike. Her willingness to get this type of power-boost -- and Naofumi's hesitation to give her one -- shows that he has lost his taste for slave crests and slavery as a whole since Shield Hero started, which is a change for the better. Earlier on he was desperate for allies and resources, and at the time he had no qualms about buying Raphtalia and using her crest to discipline her. Now Naofumi has more assets and allies than ever. That, combined with his better attitude after getting his name cleared of that false crime, means he has a new mindset. He is no longer a bitter pragmatist but a proper role model and father figure to his party, and he won't use slave crests unless the other person demands it.  In addition, Rishia's actions suggest she is the new Naofumi: an unfortunate and desperate adventurer who will pay any price to get what she needs to survive, even resorting to slavery and cruel magic. The main difference is that Rishia wanted the slave crest for herself instead of putting it on someone else. It shows remarkable resolve and commitment, but also a low sense of self-worth. For now, her desperation and low self-esteem define her character arc in Shield Hero, but if she can score some victories in upcoming Waves, that may soon change -- and she might even rethink her slave crest.

Home Anime Twice Was My Hero Academia's Hilarious & Tragic, One-Man Army    Twice Was My Hero Academia's Hilarious & Tragic, One-Man Army  By Kelvin Kwao Published 1 hour ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   My Hero Academia's Twice is the series' most hilarious villain -- however, his mysterious past is anything but.                 The villains of My Hero Academia are no strangers to conflict, but Bubaigawara Jin, aka Twice, literally couldn't imagine his life without it. Following a tragic accident involving the use of his Double Quirk, Twice had to live with an alter ego in his head, constantly second-guessing his decisions and, at times, even blurting out the opposite of what the villain intended to say. It was a condition that severely hampered his ability to relate to others. However, Twice's troubles began long before.  My Hero Academia goes to great lengths to drive home the point that most of its villains are victims, in some way, of the Quirk-based society: Himiko Toga's Transform Quirk gives her an insatiable thirst for blood; Dabi's vendetta against Endeavor stemmed from the abuse he'd endured as a child. However, among them, there was no greater victim of circumstance than Twice. His foray into villainy wasn't a path he chose, nor was it one he seemed to particularly enjoy, but that was the only path left available to him. RELATED: Near-Forgotten MHA Theory Rises From the Ashes - and Dabi May Do the Same                  Twice had been alone from the beginning. He had no family or friends to rely on for support, and he was destitute once a car accident left him with a criminal record. With no one willing to hire a registered felon, Twice took to petty villainy for survival, and used his Double Quirk to create the community he'd lacked, as well as an infinite number of henchmen. All was well until his clones turned on each other, asserting that each was the original Twice. The sight of many iterations of himself physically harming each other broke something within Twice, and ever since, his strange condition manifested, and he vowed not to use his Quirk in himself ever again.  Despite the terrible cards that life had dealt him, Twice maintained his upbeat view on life, and once he joined the League of Villains, he was ecstatic that he'd made new friends. Being a mentally unstable villain left him with few avenues where he was accepted as he was, so he treasured the League for granting him this new community. He was quite devoted to his friends, and was always eager to prove his usefulness to the team. RELATED: MHA: The UA Traitor's Most Selfless Moment Hinted at Their Tragic Backstory                 Twice proved his devotion to the League several times over. He never used his Quirk for personal gain, although he was arguably the most powerful member of the team; it formed a valuable tool the League could exploit during its guerrilla raids. When the League was in the greatest danger, during the fight against the Meta-Liberation Army, Twice overcame his fear of doubling himself. In an instant,he created an army to rescue his friends, and in a matter of moments had completely turned the tide against the thousands of Liberation soldiers.  Twice's death occurred in the pursuit of his goal to protect the League. During the Paranormal Liberation War, Hawks cornered him and warned that he'd be forced to take Twice down if he didn't surrender. Undeterred by the threat, Twice continued fighting to protect the League, forcing Hawks to end his life lest Twice trigger another unstoppable Sad Man's Parade. Twice's death, apart from being one of the series most emotional moments, was the first instance a Pro-Hero had been shown using fatal force against a villain. At that moment, the line between hero and villain was blurred, especially since the victim was in the pursuit of a goal that would be described as heroic if he was any of the series' main cast. At his core, Twice was just a man who loved and wished to protect his friends burdened with the mistakes of his past. He was the furthest thing from evil and that made him one of My Hero Academia's most interesting villains.

Home Anime The Best Slice-of-Life Anime With Dark Undertones     The Best Slice-of-Life Anime With Dark Undertones   By Jessie Xu Published 12 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Slice of life anime are most often lighthearted stories - but not always. Here are some of the best slice of life titles with darker themes.                  The following article contains discussion of suicide and self-harm.   Slice of life as a genre is generally accepted as a pretty lighthearted display of everyday life with no major conflicts. It’s often grounded within a strong comedic premise, characterized by bright colors and cheerful characters. Series like Nichijou and Wotakoi: Love Is Hard for Otaku are great examples of a traditional take on this genre.  In recent years, anime studios have begun experimenting with incorporating darker themes into what had previously been established as a bright genre. This is in line with the growing maturity of audiences as well as the growing diversity of anime. Combining slice of life with dark themes adds extra depth to a series, without making it so heavy that it could be hard to watch. Here are some of the best examples of slice of life anime that have dark undertones. RELATED: Flying Witch Shares a Fascinating Concept With Harry Potter - and It's Not Magic          Wonder Egg Priority Looks Into the Inner Demons of Humanity                 As one of the most recent adaptations, Wonder Egg Priority follows the story of Ai Ooto after the suicide of her best friend, Koito Nagase. Following the instructions of a mysterious entity, Ai purchases a Wonder Egg, which enables her to fight off people’s trauma, regrets and fears as fantasized enemies in a dream realm. With each person she successfully saves from their demons, she grows one step closer to saving her best friend. Despite the deceptively bright colors and youthful protagonists, Wonder Egg Priority explores the depths of humanity’s inner demons through their dream realms. A sexually abused girl facing off against the monsterized teacher that abused her. A school gymnast standing up against a gym teacher that pressurised her. It’s made even more poignant and bittersweet when it’s revealed that all the victims are already dead.  RELATED: The Most Overlooked Iyashikei Anime Series - and Where to Watch Them          Girls’ Last Tour Explores a Post-Apocalyptic World                 Girls’ Last Tour is set amid the rubble of a once-thriving city torn apart by war. In this post-apocalyptic setting, Chito and Yuuri seem to be the only survivors as they ride through the desolation on their motorbike, scavenging for food and contemplating life before the war. This entire anime is lighthearted and cutesy, detailing their everyday adventures and discoveries. However, by framing their story from a third-person perspective, it offers a unique insight into the reality of the situation beyond what the girls themselves might perceive.  RELATED: Aharen-san Redefines the Possibilities of Kuudere Anime Characters          Your Lie in April Treasures the Fragility of Life                 Initially presented as a typical slice of life school anime, Your Lie in April quickly takes a dive into the deep end. It is revealed that prodigious pianist Kousei Arima can no longer hear the sound of the piano after his mother’s death. Amid themes of childhood trauma, Kousei finally regains color in his life when he meets the upbeat violinist Kaori Miyazono, who hides a secret of her own beneath her cheerful facade. Interspersed between peaceful scenes of everyday school life are flashbacks to childhood trauma and the realities of dealing with a terminal illness. This duality in dynamics is executed beautifully. Despite the undercurrent of darker themes, the overall tone of this series remains hopeful, playing to the strengths of the slice of life genre.  RELATED: Komi Can't Communicate & Other Great High School Anime Streaming on Netflix          Orange Tackles Heavy Themes of Mental Health                 At its core, Orange tells a story of regret. One day, 16-year-old Naho Takamiya receives a strange letter from herself 10 years in the future, detailing the regrets her future self wished to fix. Among those is one related to the new transfer student, Kakeru Naruse, who is no longer alive in the future. Given the opportunity to fix past mistakes, Naho strives to save Kakeru before history repeats itself. The themes of Orange are made a lot more significant because its setting is grounded in reality. Mental health leading to suicide is often very subtle and hard to notice, and this story accurately portrays that. It doesn’t overdramatize the issue but invites the audience to look out for signs and clues along with the protagonists.  RELATED: 2022 Is Proving Anime Fans Can Always Hope for Their Favorite Series' Return          Usagi Drop Breaks the Stigma of Being a Single Parent                 Anime can explore a lot of dark themes, but the topic of being a single parent is rarely touched upon. Usagi Drop follows 30-year-old bachelor Daikichi Kawachi as he tries to raise Rin, his grandfather’s illegitimate daughter with no child-rearing experience whatsoever. Daikichi and Rin have a very unique father-daughter relationship. Forced together by circumstance, both are trying to adjust to this new life and relationship dynamic. It’s endearing to see how they learn and grow together through everyday annoyances and troubles.  Slice of life anime doesn’t just have to be simple stories of everyday fun. When used in conjunction with darker themes, they offer a much more complex process of storytelling which sets these series apart from others.

10-04-2022,anime,7,0,https://www.cbr.com/best-slice-of-life-anime-dark-undertones/,Best Slice-of-Life Anime With Dark Undertones,"      Home Anime The Best Slice-of-Life Anime With Dark Undertones     The Best Slice-of-Life Anime With Dark Undertones   By Jessie Xu Published 12 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Slice of life anime are most often lighthearted stories - but not always. Here are some of the best slice of life titles with darker themes.                  The following article contains discussion of suicide and self-harm.   Slice of life as a genre is generally accepted as a pretty lighthearted display of everyday life with no major conflicts. It’s often grounded within a strong comedic premise, characterized by bright colors and cheerful characters. Series like Nichijou and Wotakoi: Love Is Hard for Otaku are great examples of a traditional take on this genre.  In recent years, anime studios have begun experimenting with incorporating darker themes into what had previously been established as a bright genre. This is in line with the growing maturity of audiences as well as the growing diversity of anime. Combining slice of life with dark themes adds extra depth to a series, without making it so heavy that it could be hard to watch. Here are some of the best examples of slice of life anime that have dark undertones. RELATED: Flying Witch Shares a Fascinating Concept With Harry Potter - and It's Not Magic          Wonder Egg Priority Looks Into the Inner Demons of Humanity                 As one of the most recent adaptations, Wonder Egg Priority follows the story of Ai Ooto after the suicide of her best friend, Koito Nagase. Following the instructions of a mysterious entity, Ai purchases a Wonder Egg, which enables her to fight off people’s trauma, regrets and fears as fantasized enemies in a dream realm. With each person she successfully saves from their demons, she grows one step closer to saving her best friend. Despite the deceptively bright colors and youthful protagonists, Wonder Egg Priority explores the depths of humanity’s inner demons through their dream realms. A sexually abused girl facing off against the monsterized teacher that abused her. A school gymnast standing up against a gym teacher that pressurised her. It’s made even more poignant and bittersweet when it’s revealed that all the victims are already dead.  RELATED: The Most Overlooked Iyashikei Anime Series - and Where to Watch Them          Girls’ Last Tour Explores a Post-Apocalyptic World                 Girls’ Last Tour is set amid the rubble of a once-thriving city torn apart by war. In this post-apocalyptic setting, Chito and Yuuri seem to be the only survivors as they ride through the desolation on their motorbike, scavenging for food and contemplating life before the war. This entire anime is lighthearted and cutesy, detailing their everyday adventures and discoveries. However, by framing their story from a third-person perspective, it offers a unique insight into the reality of the situation beyond what the girls themselves might perceive.  RELATED: Aharen-san Redefines the Possibilities of Kuudere Anime Characters          Your Lie in April Treasures the Fragility of Life                 Initially presented as a typical slice of life school anime, Your Lie in April quickly takes a dive into the deep end. It is revealed that prodigious pianist Kousei Arima can no longer hear the sound of the piano after his mother’s death. Amid themes of childhood trauma, Kousei finally regains color in his life when he meets the upbeat violinist Kaori Miyazono, who hides a secret of her own beneath her cheerful facade. Interspersed between peaceful scenes of everyday school life are flashbacks to childhood trauma and the realities of dealing with a terminal illness. This duality in dynamics is executed beautifully. Despite the undercurrent of darker themes, the overall tone of this series remains hopeful, playing to the strengths of the slice of life genre.  RELATED: Komi Can't Communicate & Other Great High School Anime Streaming on Netflix          Orange Tackles Heavy Themes of Mental Health                 At its core, Orange tells a story of regret. One day, 16-year-old Naho Takamiya receives a strange letter from herself 10 years in the future, detailing the regrets her future self wished to fix. Among those is one related to the new transfer student, Kakeru Naruse, who is no longer alive in the future. Given the opportunity to fix past mistakes, Naho strives to save Kakeru before history repeats itself. The themes of Orange are made a lot more significant because its setting is grounded in reality. Mental health leading to suicide is often very subtle and hard to notice, and this story accurately portrays that. It doesn’t overdramatize the issue but invites the audience to look out for signs and clues along with the protagonists.  RELATED: 2022 Is Proving Anime Fans Can Always Hope for Their Favorite Series' Return          Usagi Drop Breaks the Stigma of Being a Single Parent                 Anime can explore a lot of dark themes, but the topic of being a single parent is rarely touched upon. Usagi Drop follows 30-year-old bachelor Daikichi Kawachi as he tries to raise Rin, his grandfather’s illegitimate daughter with no child-rearing experience whatsoever. Daikichi and Rin have a very unique father-daughter relationship. Forced together by circumstance, both are trying to adjust to this new life and relationship dynamic. It’s endearing to see how they learn and grow together through everyday annoyances and troubles.  Slice of life anime doesn’t just have to be simple stories of everyday fun. When used in conjunction with darker themes, they offer a much more complex process of storytelling which sets these series apart from others.

By Marc York Published 19 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Here's everything there is to know about the Ackerman bloodline of Attack on Titan, including what they are and what they can do.            Ackerman Family      The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4, Episode 28, ""The Dawn of Humanity,"" now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll.   Attack on Titan: The Final Season has brought a number of big surprises to the table, especially as they pertain to the Ackermans. Eren, in particular, had a lot to say about the clan, although he used this information to force Mikasa to hate her. He told the poor girl that her feelings for him were an instinctive part of her Ackerman blood rather than genuinely-developed feelings of affection. This, among other things Eren said, broke Mikasa's heart, but it might not have been true.  The last episode of The Final Season Part 2 reveals a different explanation from Zeke. The sum of his information suggests that Mikasa's feelings are, in fact, genuine and have nothing to do with her lineage. Eren's apparent lies have made the truth about the Ackermans hard to follow for fans. In order to clear things up, here's a look at everything there is to know about the Ackerman family. RELATED: Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2's Biggest Unanswered Questions                Historically, the Ackermans were meant to live in service to the Eldian royal family. However, after the fall of Eldia, they rejected King Fritz's idea of peace, so they were persecuted and hunted to near-extinction. It was only after Kenny Ackerman met Uri Reiss, then the reigning king, that the purge stopped.  The Ackerman family was created through experimentation by the old Eldian Empire on the Subjects of Ymir. As a result of this experimentation, the Ackermans were granted the ability to use the Power of the Titans while in human form. This is most observable in their practically-superhuman feats, including Mikasa's strength and Levi's ability to survive a point-blank Thunder Spear. RELATED: Attack on Titan: Historia's Fate Parallels Grisha'sThe Ackermans are also immune to the memory manipulation of the Founding Titan, which is how they retained their memories of life before the Walls. This is also partly the reason they were able to reject King Fritz's ideals; if they could be forced to forget, they wouldn't even know what there was to be against. This inability to be controlled is what led King Fritz to hunt them down to a handful.  Another ability of the Ackermans is to be ""awakened."" Besides their superhuman abilities, they also gain the battle experience of previous Ackermans through the paths. This is what makes them so proficient in combat, especially Levi ""Humanity's Strongest Soldier"" Ackerman. The only caveat is that the Ackermans need to be awakened by their instinct to survive. Mikasa exemplified this when she was nine and Eren told her to ""fight"" as they were attacked by robbers. By tapping into her hidden potential, she could crush a knife grip, break floorboards, and stab a robber through the heart from behind. If her life wasn't put in danger, she would have remained an ordinary little girl.  RELATED: Attack on Titan Solves the Colossal Titans' Biggest Weakness According to Eren, however, there was another cause for this awakening. In Episode 14 of The Final Season, ""Savagery,"" Eren said that the awakening was caused in response to an Ackerman's instinct to defend a ""host."" This could be seen as plausible as many of the Ackermans could also be said to have hosts; for Levi, it would have been Erwin Smith; for Kenny, there was Uri. All the Ackermans who went on to be warriors had somebody they wanted to protect. Eren further backed his claim about Ackerman instincts by citing Mikasa's headaches. According to him, the headaches are caused by the Ackermans' true personalities trying to oppose the host. He went on to say that Mikasa's inclination to follow her Ackerman blood, and thus not be free, was what made him hate her.  Later, however, Armin suggested to Mikasa that Eren might have been lying about all of this. In Episode 18, ""Sneak Attack,"" he put forth that He and Eren had known about Mikasa's headaches for a long time. He went on to suggest that Eren used that one truth to make the rest of what he said sound convincing. For all they knew, everything else Eren said was a lie. While this uncertainty about what was and wasn't true comforted Mikasa, it was also the source of a lot of confusion among the fans. RELATED: Marco's Final Words on Attack on Titan Are the Anime's Most Important                 Thankfully, Episode 28, ""The Dawn of Humanity,"" helped to discern fact from fiction. In a flashback, Eren was shown having a conversation with Zeke Yeager about the cause of Mikasa's devotion to him. While awakening through triggered survival instincts was confirmed to be true through research, there was no evidence that it had anything to do with headaches or a host. In Zeke's humble opinion, Mikasa's faithfulness was simply because she liked Eren. In any case, the Ackermans are an incredible family. Their strength, instinct for battle, and immunity to the Founder's powers make them a force to be reckoned with. With all that said, the cause of Mikasa's headaches remains a mystery.

Home Anime Sakamoto Days Feels Like It Comes From the '90s - and That's a Good Thing    Sakamoto Days Feels Like It Comes From the '90s - and That's a Good Thing  By Dallas Marshall Published 2 days ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Sakamoto Days has the feel of a manga from the '90s which may be off-putting to some, but there's more than enough hijinks and action to draw in fans.                 People who come from a history of crime have a lot to deal with. As they do their best to live a clean life, they sometimes have to deal with their former checkered lives, such as vengeful enemies, temptations to make ""easy money"" and old compatriots trying to force them back into their old ways. Most stories surrounding the theme of redemption and trying to escape a life of crime usually end in tragedy, a sad reminder that crime doesn't pay.  Today's manga is anything but sad, serious or a cautionary tale. Sakamoto Days, written by Yuto Suzuki and published by Viz Media, is a silly romp surrounding the life of a former hitman named Sakamoto. He was not just any hitman but the greatest the Yakuza have ever seen. Sakamoto was dashing, deadly and an expert killer. But after starting a family, he is now out of shape and the only trigger he pulls is the one on a bar code scanner since, after leaving his life of crime, he opened a convenience store with his lovely wife and child. While he may have left the underworld behind him, the underworld has not forgotten Sakamoto. A figure from his past comes to his store and makes a request: ""return to the assassin world, or die!""  RELATED: The Director of Escaflowne Was Also Behind This Old-School Sci-Fi Crime Anim                The first noticeable factor about Sakamoto Days is that the art style is reminiscent of Viz Media's 1990s manga. The linework is softer and has less of the in-your-face aesthetics that cover the pages of modern-day manga. Sakamoto Days is a crime story that feels less like the gritty work of such dramas as Gangsta or Black Lagoon and more like a '90s staple such as Fushigi Yugi or Yu Yu Hakusho. While this may be off-putting to some fans of modern manga, the juxtaposition of softness mixed with the plot's challenging crime themes is an amusing dualism.  It is also funny that the jokes are thrown at the reader at a mile-a-minute pace alongside the action, which usually involves Sakamoto dealing with the day-to-day struggles of life like going to the grocery store is as severe as an assassination mission. After all, old habits die hard. However, despite its comedic tones, Sakamoto Days is for an older teen audience and features some violent scenes that should be avoided by the younger readers in the crowd. Luckily for our out-of-shape former criminal, he has a loving family that helps him keep on the straight and narrow. One of the best things about this manga is its main lead characters. Sakamoto's wife, Aoi, is his rock throughout and while she does know of his dark past, she sees the good in him and makes it her life's mission to guide her husband to be the best man he can be.  RELATED: The Best Free Short Manga on Manga Plus                 Love can change a man and Sakamoto Days reminds readers that even those who have the shadiest of histories can find redemption. So, instead of being a hitman for the Yakuza, Sakamoto utilizes his quick reflexes for customer care and community service, even if he gets carried away at times -- much to the chagrin of his wife and readers' amusement. As for some of the secondary characters in this manga, such as fellow former assassin-turned-convenience-store-clerk Shin, not many unique traits can be spoken for. Most of the side characters are, for lack of a better term, just there.  Sakamoto Days does not reinvent the wheel when it comes to comedy manga. The jokes are serviceable, complete with slapstick humor and visual gags that induce chuckles. The action scenes are well put together but will not blow readers' minds. But as a fun diversion with a somewhat retro aesthetic, Sakamoto Days does not need to be revolutionary to be entertaining and sets out to tell a silly story about redemption. It's the white cake of comedy manga: simple, somewhat sweet and direct. In a challenging world such as ours, sometimes folks need some comfort food -- even if it's all about crime and the bloodshed that comes with it.

Here's a look back at the anime's biggest plot twists so far.                 My Dress-Up Darling was a smash-hit rom-com anime in the Winter 2022 season, starring the lively cosplay enthusiast Kitagawa Marin and her new partner, the shy but hardworking Gojo Wakana. They soon embarked on an educational and uplifting journey into the world of cosplay together, and both gained a lot from it.  The story of My Dress-Up Darling is told in just 12 episodes, but it still managed to pack in some intriguing and meaningful plot twists and developments that kept the series moving at a healthy pace. Fans can look back fondly and remember the most impactful plot twists that helped the story and its characters along. RELATED: The Most Anticipated New & Returning Rom-Com Anime of Spring 2022          When Gojo Agreed to Make a Shizuka-Tan Cosplay For Marin                When Gojo and Marin first met early in My Dress-Up Darling, Marin made a request: for Gojo the doll maker to become her cosplay expert and help her make a costume of her favorite Slippery Girls 2 character, Shizuka-Tan. This request is what helped forge their new friendship, and Gojo accepted the challenge with relish.  The project helped establish their friendship, but also showed how devoted Gojo is to his craft. He amazed Marin when he pushed himself to finish her cosplay in record time, which helped set the tone for his character going forward. RELATED: How My Dress-Up Darling's Marin and Gojo Built Anime's Healthiest Friendship          When Gojo Called Marin Beautiful                After Gojo worked so hard on her cosplay, Marin went ahead and attended a cosplay event where everyone was getting their picture taken. On the train ride home, Gojo off-handedly remarked on Marin's beauty, since he, as a hina doll maker, equates it with quality and good craftsmanship. In his eyes, Marin was like a high-quality, living hina doll -- but Marin took it differently.  This was a love confession to her ears, and it changed the tone of their platonic friendship. Flattered, Marin developed an immediate and innocent crush on Gojo and maintained those feelings throughout the show, to the point of becoming jealously possessive. She even made the trademark yandere stare at one point, though no one was around to see it. RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling Embodies Horimiya's Best Storytelling Themes          When Gojo Combined His Two Hobbies To Improve His Skills                As My Dress-Up Darling continued, Gojo had to put his hina doll hobby on hold to make time for cosplay with Marin, and it was just as well. He had hit a wall with hina dolls after struggling to paint their faces correctly, but to his pleasant surprise, he learned that he could actually combine his hobbies.  By putting on Marin's cosplay makeup multiple times, Gojo became better at cosmetics, which meant he could paint hina doll faces better than ever. His hobbies had become more than the sum of their parts, boding well for his future with each hobby. Gojo's growth was quicker than many expected. RELATED: The My Dress-Up Darling Anime's Biggest Changes From the Manga          When Inui Sajuna Joined My Dress-Up Darling's Cast                Marin's cosplay role model and idol, the popular cosplayer Inui Sajuna, arrived to help Marin and Gojo take their hobby to the next level. In particular, she wanted Gojo to make a custom costume for her with his trademark quality. Along the way, Sajuna and her new friends learned much from one another.  Gojo and Marin both learned new strategies for costume creation and photography from Sajuna, while she in turn learned the value of homemade cosplay from Gojo and came to appreciate his expert technique. Having Sajuna was a distinct leap forward for Marin and Gojo's budding cosplay career together. RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling Celebrates Season Finale With New Artwork          When Inui Shinju Decided To Cosplay, Too                Sajuna's little sister Shinju was content to be her supporter and little more, with the latter lacking the confidence to try cosplay on her own. After meeting Gojo and Marin, however, Shinju finally worked up the courage to try her first cosplay, showing remarkable character growth. She amazed everyone in My Dress-Up Darling with her crossplay as a dark-haired male anime character, and is now a confident cosplayer who is ready to show off what she can do to the world.

Go Rush’s Card Game Mechanics for Old-School Fans  By Gregory Segal Published 23 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   With Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!! set to release this month, it seems like a better time than any to go over the game rules, as they're quite different!                 The gameplay of Yu-Gi-Oh! has changed throughout its many anime series and the physical card game. From the number of life points characters have to the summoning mechanics and type of monsters playable, each rendition of the show has developed and added a variety of new features.  Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!! will be building on the rules that were introduced in its previous season, Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS, which saw the game take a dramatic turn from the formats that each previous anime has followed. Unlike the traditional game fans know and love, Rush Duels offers a more simplified game style, similar to Speed Duels, that harkens back to the old-school days of the game. Since Yu-Gi-Oh SEVENS has yet to be released outside of Japan, many fans may still be unfamiliar with the new mechanics of the upcoming show, so here’s a breakdown of what to expect. RELATED: Aharen-San's Premiere Episode Echoes Komi Can't Communicate's Shojo-Style Stor          What Changes To The Rules Have Been Made?                 The first thing that fans of the game will notice is that the duel field has been scaled down in size. Now, players only have three monster zones and spell and trap zones rather than the traditional five. Pendulum and Extra Monster zones no longer exist; however, this might be something that's developed within this new series. The mechanics for normal summoning monsters has also changed. Typically, characters have only been able to Normal Summon once per turn -- unless they’re cheating to enhance the plot, which can be seen pretty often in Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters. Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duels allows characters to Normal Summon or Set as many monsters as they want within a single turn; however, all Level 5 or higher monsters still must be Tribute Summoned.  To balance this mechanic, all monster effects can only be activated once per turn while they are face up on the field. Although this has an impact on how players play in real life, it's unlikely to dramatically alter how cards are used in the show. RELATED: How Naruto’s Backstory Is Similar to Orient Protagonist Musashi's As both the name of the series and the card game it is based upon suggest, the pace of duels is much quicker than fans have come to expect. This means that not only can characters summon monsters at a faster pace, but the number of cards that they draw has also increased. Rather than getting one card per turn during the Draw Phase, players are able to continuously add cards to their hand from the top of their deck until they have five cards. Moreover, there is no limit to the number of cards a character can have in their hand.  Since this occurs each turn and characters will lose a duel if they run through their deck too quickly, every game will likely be a rush to see who can win before this happens. Fans of the show can likely expect to see a few close games in which one character loses simply due to their inability to draw. Other slight tweaks to the game have been made, although the rest of the rules have largely remained the same. Characters start with 4000-8000 LP and can only have 40-60 cards in their Main Deck. However, there are other innovations present when it comes to the summoning mechanics of certain monsters.  RELATED: How Science Fell in Love Became a Battle Shonen Anime          How Does Fusion Summoning Work?                 Over the course of Yu-Gi-Oh’s history, fusion summoning has occurred in a plethora of different ways, from using the classic Polymerization card to unique Contact Fusions. Under the majority of circumstances, players are able to fuse monsters from their hands, field and sometimes even deck. However, in Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush!!, a fusion can only occur when monsters are on the player's field and the spell card “fusion” has been activated.          What’s Maximum Summoning?                 Maximum Summoning is a mechanic that's exclusive to Rush Duels and was first introduced in Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS. Characters initiate this summon by having all three pieces of a Maximum Monster in their hand and either an empty field or the ability to send all monsters they control to the grave.  RELATED: Sasaki and Miyano: How to Get Started With the Anime and Manga The monster summoned is treated as a single card and can only attack once unless it's otherwise stated. If the monster is destroyed or returned to the hand, the rest of the pieces follow suit. However, the effects of each card can be activated separately and summoned individually. Similar to Link Monsters, Maximum Monsters do not have any Defense and cannot be changed to Defense Position. As Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!! progresses, it's possible that new mechanics and rules will come into play. When looking at its counterpart, Speed Duels, it's reasonable to assume that as time goes on, Synchro, Xyz, Pendulum and even Link Summoning will enter the game as characters discover new and exciting ways to duel each other. However, with space on the field being limited and Konami wanting to simplify the game for older fans of the show, it might be a while until this happens, if at all.

Go Rush’s Card Game Mechanics for Old-School Fans    An Introduction to Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush’s Card Game Mechanics for Old-School Fans  By Gregory Segal Published 23 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   With Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!! set to release this month, it seems like a better time than any to go over the game rules, as they're quite different!                 The gameplay of Yu-Gi-Oh! has changed throughout its many anime series and the physical card game. From the number of life points characters have to the summoning mechanics and type of monsters playable, each rendition of the show has developed and added a variety of new features.  Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!! will be building on the rules that were introduced in its previous season, Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS, which saw the game take a dramatic turn from the formats that each previous anime has followed. Unlike the traditional game fans know and love, Rush Duels offers a more simplified game style, similar to Speed Duels, that harkens back to the old-school days of the game. Since Yu-Gi-Oh SEVENS has yet to be released outside of Japan, many fans may still be unfamiliar with the new mechanics of the upcoming show, so here’s a breakdown of what to expect. RELATED: Aharen-San's Premiere Episode Echoes Komi Can't Communicate's Shojo-Style Stor          What Changes To The Rules Have Been Made?

Adapting an anime to live-action is incredibly tricky – anime and film are two completely different worlds. The best a live-action take can do is capture the spirit of the anime it's bringing to life, but a good number of movies fail in this regard.  RELATED: 5 Anime That Have A Great Live-Action Adaptions (& 5 That Fell Flat) Whether it's misunderstanding the anime's style and themes or deliberately going against everything the original stood for, these live-action adaptations fell short for reasons beyond being unfaithful to the visuals or lore.  10          Bleach Had None Of The Anime's Punk Energy                 For all its flaws, Bleach continues to be a beloved anime because of its punk aesthetic and energy. Whether it was the character designs, episodes' direction, or promotional material, Bleach had a uniquely colorful edge that most anime hope to have. Shinsuke Sato's adaptation, however, dropped all of these stylistic choices.  The live-action Bleach was an urban fantasy that grounded the anime's outlandish moments and world in serious realism. Outside some colorful title cards that disappeared after the first act, the movie had little in the way of anarchic energy. The movie is fairly decent and was even approved by Tite Kubo, but It's nowhere near as wild as it should've been.  9          The Gintama Movies Only Captured The Anime's Costumes & Looks                 Gintama earned its reputation as the gag anime to beat, but almost none of its mastery of humor and parody was reflected in its two live action movies, Gintama and Gintama 2: Rules Are Made To Be Broken. At most, the movies looked more like live-action recreations of the anime's most popular skits as performed by some impressive cosplayers.  Yuichi Fukuda's adaptations were at their best when they made up new jokes and spoofed the fact that they were movies, but these moments were few and far between. Gintama became what it is by making its own brand of comedy separate from the already hilarious manga, but, unfortunately, none of this originality was used for the movies.  8          Lupin The 3rd Had None Of The Anime's Spirit & Originality                 Lupin The Third isn't just a landmark anime, but it's practically an institution as well. The anime, manga's style, and story continue to influence Japanese fiction today, which is why any new adaptation should strive to break new ground as its forerunners did. Unfortunately, Ryuhei Kitamura's critically-panned Lupin The 3rd failed to do so.   RELATED: 5 Anime & Manga Couples That Honestly Shouldn't Be Together At most, all this adaptation had were some text-accurate costumes, poses, and quotes. The movie was as derivative as any uninspired con movie before it, complete with a needlessly convoluted plot that confused confusion for intrigue. By not even trying to do anything new, Lupin The 3rd was just a legendary anime's surface-level reenactment.  7          Kite Was Not As Controversial & Stylish As The OVAs                 Without exaggeration, the Kite OVAs are some of the most controversial anime ever created. Besides the excessive gore, Sawa's time as an assassin was borderline pornographic – so much so that the OVA was banned in certain countries. Understandably, the live-action adaptation toned these parts down or cut them, but lost the original's spirit in doing so.  Ralph Ziman's Kite was as forgettable and pedestrian as a movie about hitmen could get. Worse, it came out at the time when movies starring female assassins like Lucy or Salt were oversaturated. Kite's biggest flaw wasn't its lack of offensive content, but its refusal to be as audacious and stylish as its infamous anime by doing anything risqué.  6          Fist Of The North Star Lacked Its Source Material's Creativity & Scale                 At its heart, Fist Of The North Star is a martial arts-driven tale of revenge. That said, it more than made up for these familiar trappings by pushing everything to the extreme. Not only was the story set in the post-apocalypse, but Kenshiro was the latest master of the Hokuto Shinken style, which granted him the power to make enemies explode.  Few if any of the over-the-top aesthetics made it to the movie, which was as formulaic as a martial arts movie could get. Tony Randel's movie unwisely toned everything down, most egregiously seen in the fights that were nowhere near as bloody and exciting as their animated counterparts. At best, the sets were surprisingly well-made despite the low budget.  5          The Attack On Titan Two-Parter Was A Typical Zombie Apocalypse                 One of the many things that makes Attack On Titan the landmark it is today is that it bears one of the greatest bait-and-switch premises ever told. As it turns out, Paradis Island's war against the Titans wasn't the fight for humanity everyone thought it was, but a dark fate placed on an entire race of people that the world isolated and vilified.  The movies, however, were just another modern-day zombie apocalypse. In brief, the Titans were tall zombies born from failed weapons experiments, and they were stopped with a nuke. Whatever complexity the anime had (especially in themes of militarism, nationalism, racism, etc.) were simplified or dropped in Shinji Higuchi's B-grade two-parter.  4          City Hunter (1993) Was Just Another Jackie Chan Movie                 In the '90s, Jackie Chan became a star by headlining action-comedies about bumbling martial arts heroes who stumbled their way into larger conspiracies. City Hunter fit this bill perfectly, and therein lies the problem. If not for its source material's legacy, Wong Jing's adaptation would be indistinguishable from the likes of Mr. Nice Guy or Rumble In The Bronx.   All City Hunter got right were the characters' names and Ryo Saeba's comedic lechery. Though it had its moments, the movie was more of by-the-numbers Jackie Chan romp than an adaptation. Not helping matters is how City Hunter got the faithfully cartoonish adaptation it deserved in Philippe Lacheau's 2018 movie, which effectively supplanted Chan's.  3          Dragonball: Evolution Was A Highschool Adventure, Not A Galactic Epic                 Part of the reason why Dragon Ball is one of the most influential anime ever made is because of its seemingly bottomless depth of its world and Goku as a person. Goku wasn't just the Monkey King's parallel in this homage to the Chinese epic Journey To The West, he was also an intergalactic warrior, a loving father and friend, and the protector of Earth.  RELATED: Top 10 Worst Ways To Die In Dragon Ball For pragmatic and mostly cynical reasons, James Wong's Dragonball: Evolution scaled everything back. Here, Goku's quest for the Dragon Balls was a coming-of-age story that was more interested in his growth as a teen than the galaxy's defender. The movie didn't just lack the anime's grand scale, but also its stakes and development.  2          Ghost In The Shell Turned The Major Into A Generic Superhero                 Despite starring an iconic action star in Major Motoko Kusanagi, the original Ghost In The Shell was anything but a conventional action story. Instead, it was a meditation about the Major's existential and identity crisis in a technologically dominant world where she's both a cog in an unfeeling inhuman system and a mass-produced cyborg model.  In contrast, Rupert Sanders' movie was the Major's heroic origin story. Here, Major Mira Killian (a cyborg with the brain of the delinquent Motoko Kusanagi) was a one of a kind cyborg super-soldier who fought for justice. Even if it's watchable and momentarily ignoring the twist's racial implications, this movie was formulaic where the anime was anything but.  1          Daily Lives Of Highschool Boys Deconstructed Its Comedy                 In brief, Daigo Matsui's Daily Lives Of Highschool Boys is a deconstruction of the animated sitcom it was based on. The movie adapted some of the anime's most famous jokes and skits, but replaced the punchlines with depressing reality checks. Wacky situations ended with the boys getting reprimanded, or with them contemplating how stupid they acted.  Matsui did this because the manga and anime reminded him of his adolescence but, instead of nostalgia, he felt embarrassment and shame. His adaptation reflected his dour outlook, which undid everything that made the anime funny. Daily Lives Of Highschool Boys was one of the funniest shows of its time, and it deserved a movie better than this.                  10 Anime That Perfectly Balance Action & Comedy  Read Next     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email    Related Topics  Anime bleach ghost in the shell ()     About The Author   Angelo Delos Trinos                                     (414 Articles Published)     CBR Staff Writer Angelo Delos Trinos' professional writing career may have only started a few years ago, but he's been writing and overthinking about anime, comics and movies for his whole life.

10-04-2022,anime,14,0,https://www.cbr.com/live-action-anime-adaptations-didnt-understand-original/,Top 10 Live-Action Anime Adaptations That Didn't Understand The Original,"      Home Anime Top 10 Live-Action Anime Adaptations That Didn't Understand The Original    Top 10 Live-Action Anime Adaptations That Didn't Understand The Original  By Angelo Delos Trinos Published 23 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Fans are often disappointed when live-action adaptations deviate from their favorite anime's storyline.                  Adapting an anime to live-action is incredibly tricky – anime and film are two completely different worlds. The best a live-action take can do is capture the spirit of the anime it's bringing to life, but a good number of movies fail in this regard.  RELATED: 5 Anime That Have A Great Live-Action Adaptions (& 5 That Fell Flat) Whether it's misunderstanding the anime's style and themes or deliberately going against everything the original stood for, these live-action adaptations fell short for reasons beyond being unfaithful to the visuals or lore.  10          Bleach Had None Of The Anime's Punk Energy                 For all its flaws, Bleach continues to be a beloved anime because of its punk aesthetic and energy. Whether it was the character designs, episodes' direction, or promotional material, Bleach had a uniquely colorful edge that most anime hope to have. Shinsuke Sato's adaptation, however, dropped all of these stylistic choices.  The live-action Bleach was an urban fantasy that grounded the anime's outlandish moments and world in serious realism. Outside some colorful title cards that disappeared after the first act, the movie had little in the way of anarchic energy. The movie is fairly decent and was even approved by Tite Kubo, but It's nowhere near as wild as it should've been.  9          The Gintama Movies Only Captured The Anime's Costumes & Looks                 Gintama earned its reputation as the gag anime to beat, but almost none of its mastery of humor and parody was reflected in its two live action movies, Gintama and Gintama 2: Rules Are Made To Be Broken. At most, the movies looked more like live-action recreations of the anime's most popular skits as performed by some impressive cosplayers.  Yuichi Fukuda's adaptations were at their best when they made up new jokes and spoofed the fact that they were movies, but these moments were few and far between. Gintama became what it is by making its own brand of comedy separate from the already hilarious manga, but, unfortunately, none of this originality was used for the movies.  8          Lupin The 3rd Had None Of The Anime's Spirit & Originality                 Lupin The Third isn't just a landmark anime, but it's practically an institution as well. The anime, manga's style, and story continue to influence Japanese fiction today, which is why any new adaptation should strive to break new ground as its forerunners did. Unfortunately, Ryuhei Kitamura's critically-panned Lupin The 3rd failed to do so.   RELATED: 5 Anime & Manga Couples That Honestly Shouldn't Be Together At most, all this adaptation had were some text-accurate costumes, poses, and quotes. The movie was as derivative as any uninspired con movie before it, complete with a needlessly convoluted plot that confused confusion for intrigue. By not even trying to do anything new, Lupin The 3rd was just a legendary anime's surface-level reenactment.  7          Kite Was Not As Controversial & Stylish As The OVAs                 Without exaggeration, the Kite OVAs are some of the most controversial anime ever created. Besides the excessive gore, Sawa's time as an assassin was borderline pornographic – so much so that the OVA was banned in certain countries. Understandably, the live-action adaptation toned these parts down or cut them, but lost the original's spirit in doing so.  Ralph Ziman's Kite was as forgettable and pedestrian as a movie about hitmen could get. Worse, it came out at the time when movies starring female assassins like Lucy or Salt were oversaturated. Kite's biggest flaw wasn't its lack of offensive content, but its refusal to be as audacious and stylish as its infamous anime by doing anything risqué.  6          Fist Of The North Star Lacked Its Source Material's Creativity & Scale                 At its heart, Fist Of The North Star is a martial arts-driven tale of revenge. That said, it more than made up for these familiar trappings by pushing everything to the extreme. Not only was the story set in the post-apocalypse, but Kenshiro was the latest master of the Hokuto Shinken style, which granted him the power to make enemies explode.  Few if any of the over-the-top aesthetics made it to the movie, which was as formulaic as a martial arts movie could get. Tony Randel's movie unwisely toned everything down, most egregiously seen in the fights that were nowhere near as bloody and exciting as their animated counterparts. At best, the sets were surprisingly well-made despite the low budget.  5          The Attack On Titan Two-Parter Was A Typical Zombie Apocalypse                 One of the many things that makes Attack On Titan the landmark it is today is that it bears one of the greatest bait-and-switch premises ever told. As it turns out, Paradis Island's war against the Titans wasn't the fight for humanity everyone thought it was, but a dark fate placed on an entire race of people that the world isolated and vilified.  The movies, however, were just another modern-day zombie apocalypse. In brief, the Titans were tall zombies born from failed weapons experiments, and they were stopped with a nuke. Whatever complexity the anime had (especially in themes of militarism, nationalism, racism, etc.) were simplified or dropped in Shinji Higuchi's B-grade two-parter.  4          City Hunter (1993) Was Just Another Jackie Chan Movie                 In the '90s, Jackie Chan became a star by headlining action-comedies about bumbling martial arts heroes who stumbled their way into larger conspiracies. City Hunter fit this bill perfectly, and therein lies the problem. If not for its source material's legacy, Wong Jing's adaptation would be indistinguishable from the likes of Mr. Nice Guy or Rumble In The Bronx.   All City Hunter got right were the characters' names and Ryo Saeba's comedic lechery. Though it had its moments, the movie was more of by-the-numbers Jackie Chan romp than an adaptation. Not helping matters is how City Hunter got the faithfully cartoonish adaptation it deserved in Philippe Lacheau's 2018 movie, which effectively supplanted Chan's.  3          Dragonball: Evolution Was A Highschool Adventure, Not A Galactic Epic                 Part of the reason why Dragon Ball is one of the most influential anime ever made is because of its seemingly bottomless depth of its world and Goku as a person. Goku wasn't just the Monkey King's parallel in this homage to the Chinese epic Journey To The West, he was also an intergalactic warrior, a loving father and friend, and the protector of Earth.  RELATED: Top 10 Worst Ways To Die In Dragon Ball For pragmatic and mostly cynical reasons, James Wong's Dragonball: Evolution scaled everything back. Here, Goku's quest for the Dragon Balls was a coming-of-age story that was more interested in his growth as a teen than the galaxy's defender. The movie didn't just lack the anime's grand scale, but also its stakes and development.  2          Ghost In The Shell Turned The Major Into A Generic Superhero                 Despite starring an iconic action star in Major Motoko Kusanagi, the original Ghost In The Shell was anything but a conventional action story. Instead, it was a meditation about the Major's existential and identity crisis in a technologically dominant world where she's both a cog in an unfeeling inhuman system and a mass-produced cyborg model.  In contrast, Rupert Sanders' movie was the Major's heroic origin story. Here, Major Mira Killian (a cyborg with the brain of the delinquent Motoko Kusanagi) was a one of a kind cyborg super-soldier who fought for justice. Even if it's watchable and momentarily ignoring the twist's racial implications, this movie was formulaic where the anime was anything but.  1          Daily Lives Of Highschool Boys Deconstructed Its Comedy                 In brief, Daigo Matsui's Daily Lives Of Highschool Boys is a deconstruction of the animated sitcom it was based on. The movie adapted some of the anime's most famous jokes and skits, but replaced the punchlines with depressing reality checks. Wacky situations ended with the boys getting reprimanded, or with them contemplating how stupid they acted.  Matsui did this because the manga and anime reminded him of his adolescence but, instead of nostalgia, he felt embarrassment and shame. His adaptation reflected his dour outlook, which undid everything that made the anime funny. Daily Lives Of Highschool Boys was one of the funniest shows of its time, and it deserved a movie better than this.                  10 Anime That Perfectly Balance Action & Comedy  Read Next     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email    Related Topics  Anime bleach ghost in the shell ()     About The Author   Angelo Delos Trinos                                     (414 Articles Published)     CBR Staff Writer Angelo Delos Trinos' professional writing career may have only started a few years ago, but he's been writing and overthinking about anime, comics and movies for his whole life.

The following contains spoilers for One-Punch Man Chapter 159, ""Source of Anxiety,"" by One, Yusuke Murata, John Werry and James Gaubatz, available in English at Viz Media.   Saitama is known for not being fazed by any threat or danger. He maintains a poker face, even in front of possible Earth-destroying catastrophe -- like when he fought Boros the alien invader or Monster King Orochi. However, that doesn't mean he is an unfeeling robot. There are some cases in which he is actually angered, but only in Chapter 159 has he reached the peak of hatred.  With the amount of power Saitama possesses, there's no longer anything that poses a threat to him. He simply decimates anything that stands in his way with a single punch, hence, the title of the manga. He is, however, not without weaknesses. He is often flustered for missing out on sales and is always problematizing his budget, and the Monster Association's wide-scale attack finally brought out the worst in him. RELATED:Every Giant-Centipede Monster in One-Punch Man (So Far) - and How They Died                 The first question Saitama asked the monsterized Garo was confirmation of his identity, which the Hero Hunter provided. He then launched into a long rant about being the absolute evil, but Saitama was no longer interested in what the monster had to say. Because he deemed Garo not to be a monster, despite the Hero Hunter's admittance, he was convinced there was nothing left for him to do there, leaving Garo surprised and confused..  Before leaving, though, Saitama ranted for a bit, recalling going out of his place to report the recurring noise. However, his house got destroyed, and he now had to go look for his belongings. Saitama expressed his frustration at the situation, claiming he was so angry he could destroy the world. Saitama's outburst wasn't just a bluff, because Garo felt immense pressure when the bald hero made the declaration. RELATED:One-Punch Man: The Hero Association's Strongest Fighter Begins a Godly Task                 Saitama getting angry is a rare occurrence, and this is the first time he reached a world-destroying level of anger. Unsurprisingly, the cause of his fury is not something heavy like losing a friend or witnessing great evil. Rather, it has something to do with his belongings. Saitama has always been concerned about things ordinary individuals will consider trivial -- like supermarket sales and winning against King in a video game. It is, however, interesting to see him express an emotion to that extreme.  Saitama has always been shown to be a calm-headed individual who couldn't feel any sense of danger, so seeing him in a fit of immense rage is a rare occurrence. If there's any moral lesson this teaches the audience, then it's that nobody should mess with Saitama's belongings under any circumstances.

By CBR Staff Published 3 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Kiyo in Kyoto is a show dedicated to teaching about Japanese culture, so can it also be entertaining?                 Kiyo in Kyoto: From the Maiko House is a lesser-known anime that came out at the tail end of the 2021 winter season. As it was produced by NHK World-Japan, the show walks a fine line between being just a means of entertainment and a means of education. There's only one way to find out whether it's more for entertainment or education, and that's by looking at the contents of the show.  However, before diving into the information given throughout the show, it's good to have an understanding of the context of Kiyo In Kyoto. The series follows Kiyo and her friend Sumire, who are both from Aomori Prefecture and want to become maiko (traditional Japanese entertainers found in Kyoto). While Sumire goes on to train and becomes a maiko, the titular character becomes the cook for that maiko house instead. The show then goes on to cover information about both maiko and Japanese food culture. As the show is produced by NHK World-Japan, the international version of the well-known Japanese broadcasting news and entertainment site, it would make sense that Kiyo in Kyoto is all about culture.  RELATED: Restaurant to Another World Vol. 1 Puts Iyashikei Into Isekai                 It's time to dive into the cultural aspects of the show, starting with the way it depicts the life of maiko. The series mainly takes place in the titular maiko house in the area of Kyoto called Kagai, where all the maiko and their housemothers live together. The show takes viewers along Sumire's journey in becoming a maiko, showing the training process with many tidbits of cultural information. It talks about the processes such as the classes maiko take to learn song and dance, as well as differences between maiko in training and maiko who have already made their ""debut"". One of these differences is the type of sash or obi the girls wear.  As seen in Episode 4, it shows how a senior apprentice who has not yet debuted wears a ""half dangling sash,"" while a full maiko wears a longer ""dangling sash."" In that same episode, Sumire gets to debut as full-fledged maiko and gets her maiko name -- Momohana -- which they explain can be chosen in many ways. They can choose the Japanese characters for the maiko's name is by taking inspiration from their real names, from the maiko house they live in or even having it divined for them at a shrine. Along with all the information within the show, there is also a separate short video produced by NHK World-Japan called ""Maiko [Maiko-san Chi no Makanai-san - Kiyo in Kyoto: From the Maiko House] - 3-minute Maiko,"" available on YouTube, where real-life maiko are showcased.  RELATED: How Assassination Classroom Offers a Glimpse at Japan's Educational System Another topic that's discussed a lot in Kiyo in Kyoto is food, which means there's also a lot of information and facts about food not only from Kyoto or Aomori but from all around Japan. The episodes are formatted around the food featured in their respective segment, as each episode is generally formatted into three parts, each a chapter of the manga featuring one main food. Then, after each segment, there are little ""talking heads"" segments, where Kiyo and Sumire, as well as sometimes their senior Tsurukoma, talk about the food they ate in that segment as well as their regional counterparts.  This segment is called ""Sumire and Kiyo's Dish of the Day."" A good example of the regional differences discussed during these scenes can be seen in the last segment of Episode 5, where the series talks about different soups from across Japan. It starts with the soup that was featured in the episode -- hittsumi soup from Aomori -- and goes on to talk about soups from other places, such as teppo soup from Hokkaido, natto soup from Yamagata and itoko soup from Kyoto. This kind of cultural analysis in these segments is common and very educational.                  Of course, to be an anime, the show must be entertaining as well, and entertaining it is. Kiyo in Kyoto has no lack of cute characters and scenes. Not everything in the show is meant to teach the viewer; it also contains a plot and characters that grow throughout, as well as numerous cute and fluffy scenes. The show can have both entertainment and educational elements within it, as many shows do. So, to answer whether Kiyo in Kyoto: From the Maiko House is an entertainment or an education series, it's happily both.                   Heaven's Design Team Mixes 'Edutainment' With...

10-04-2022,anime,3,0,https://www.cbr.com/kiyo-in-kyoto-entertainment-or-education-anime/,Is Kiyo in Kyoto Entertainment or Education?,"      Home Anime Is Kiyo in Kyoto Entertainment or Education?    Is Kiyo in Kyoto Entertainment or Education?  By CBR Staff Published 3 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Kiyo in Kyoto is a show dedicated to teaching about Japanese culture, so can it also be entertaining?                 Kiyo in Kyoto: From the Maiko House is a lesser-known anime that came out at the tail end of the 2021 winter season. As it was produced by NHK World-Japan, the show walks a fine line between being just a means of entertainment and a means of education. There's only one way to find out whether it's more for entertainment or education, and that's by looking at the contents of the show.  However, before diving into the information given throughout the show, it's good to have an understanding of the context of Kiyo In Kyoto. The series follows Kiyo and her friend Sumire, who are both from Aomori Prefecture and want to become maiko (traditional Japanese entertainers found in Kyoto). While Sumire goes on to train and becomes a maiko, the titular character becomes the cook for that maiko house instead. The show then goes on to cover information about both maiko and Japanese food culture. As the show is produced by NHK World-Japan, the international version of the well-known Japanese broadcasting news and entertainment site, it would make sense that Kiyo in Kyoto is all about culture.  RELATED: Restaurant to Another World Vol. 1 Puts Iyashikei Into Isekai                 It's time to dive into the cultural aspects of the show, starting with the way it depicts the life of maiko. The series mainly takes place in the titular maiko house in the area of Kyoto called Kagai, where all the maiko and their housemothers live together. The show takes viewers along Sumire's journey in becoming a maiko, showing the training process with many tidbits of cultural information. It talks about the processes such as the classes maiko take to learn song and dance, as well as differences between maiko in training and maiko who have already made their ""debut"". One of these differences is the type of sash or obi the girls wear.  As seen in Episode 4, it shows how a senior apprentice who has not yet debuted wears a ""half dangling sash,"" while a full maiko wears a longer ""dangling sash."" In that same episode, Sumire gets to debut as full-fledged maiko and gets her maiko name -- Momohana -- which they explain can be chosen in many ways. They can choose the Japanese characters for the maiko's name is by taking inspiration from their real names, from the maiko house they live in or even having it divined for them at a shrine. Along with all the information within the show, there is also a separate short video produced by NHK World-Japan called ""Maiko [Maiko-san Chi no Makanai-san - Kiyo in Kyoto: From the Maiko House] - 3-minute Maiko,"" available on YouTube, where real-life maiko are showcased.  RELATED: How Assassination Classroom Offers a Glimpse at Japan's Educational System Another topic that's discussed a lot in Kiyo in Kyoto is food, which means there's also a lot of information and facts about food not only from Kyoto or Aomori but from all around Japan. The episodes are formatted around the food featured in their respective segment, as each episode is generally formatted into three parts, each a chapter of the manga featuring one main food. Then, after each segment, there are little ""talking heads"" segments, where Kiyo and Sumire, as well as sometimes their senior Tsurukoma, talk about the food they ate in that segment as well as their regional counterparts.  This segment is called ""Sumire and Kiyo's Dish of the Day."" A good example of the regional differences discussed during these scenes can be seen in the last segment of Episode 5, where the series talks about different soups from across Japan. It starts with the soup that was featured in the episode -- hittsumi soup from Aomori -- and goes on to talk about soups from other places, such as teppo soup from Hokkaido, natto soup from Yamagata and itoko soup from Kyoto. This kind of cultural analysis in these segments is common and very educational.                  Of course, to be an anime, the show must be entertaining as well, and entertaining it is. Kiyo in Kyoto has no lack of cute characters and scenes. Not everything in the show is meant to teach the viewer; it also contains a plot and characters that grow throughout, as well as numerous cute and fluffy scenes. The show can have both entertainment and educational elements within it, as many shows do. So, to answer whether Kiyo in Kyoto: From the Maiko House is an entertainment or an education series, it's happily both.                   Heaven's Design Team Mixes 'Edutainment' With...

By Louis Kemner Published 22 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   One specific character is the true boss of the Melromarc kingdom in The Rising of the Shield Hero - and an ally of Naofumi's.                 The Rising of the Shield Hero is a grim but exciting isekai anime starring the unfortunate protagonist Iwatani Naofumi, the titular shield-bearing hero who must save the Melromarc kingdom from Waves of monsters. At first it seemed no one in the royal court was on Naofumi's side, but that soon changed when the queen showed up.  Naofumi had a terrible experience with King Aultclay XXXII and his daughter, Princess Malty, but Queen Mirellia Melromarc is a different story. Her worldview and policies differ greatly from her scheming husband's, and she played a much bigger role in the later sequences of Season 1. This may continue well into Season 2 of Shield Hero as well. RELATED: Meet The Rising of the Shield Hero's Main Characters          The Fair Rule Of Queen Mirellia Melromarc                Shield Hero's Melromarc kingdom is a matrilineal nation, meaning the royal bloodline is carried through the women while men such as Aultclay marry into the family. This means Queen Mirellia wields the most power in Melromarc, but when Naofumi arrived with the other three Cardinal Heroes, she was nowhere to be seen. This led to a bad start for Naofumi's adventure, since King Aultclay and Princess Malty were scheming with the Church of Three Heroes to tarnish the Shield Hero's name forever. This scheme could have been uncovered and dealt with much sooner had the queen been there, since she is a fair and honorable ruler who doesn't share her husband and elder daughter's hatred of the Shield Hero.  There's more than a personal difference between the queen, king and elder princess, however. The three royals are split because of international and race politics as well, all based on the presence of demi-humans in the Melromarc kingdom and the historic role of the Shield Hero. In previous eras, the Shield Hero was a symbol of hope for the demi-humans, and in the modern era, Mirellia is also sympathetic to both parties rather than being prejudiced against anyone. This is why she accepted the tanuki-like Raphtalia as the Shield Hero's companion without complaint. Unlike the rest of the royal family, Mirellia -- and her younger daughter Melty -- seek to unite the four heroes and make use of the Shield Hero, rather than ostracize him because of race relations between humans and demi-humans. Queen Mirellia is a symbol of hope and tolerance in the eyes of demi-humans, which puts her at odds with her family and even the non-Shield heroes at times. But as Season 1 of Shield Hero showed, this all set her up as Naofumi's most powerful ally.  RELATED: How the Shield Hero Anime Refined the Isekai Harem Concept          How Queen Mirellia Aided Naofumi In Shield Hero Season 1                Queen Mirellia didn't appear at first in The Rising of the Shield Hero, but did make some cameo appearances along with her Shadow agents until being formally introduced later on. Mirellia helped uncover the Church of Three Heroes' plot with the king, and personally oversaw the trial where King Aultclay and Princess Malty were found guilty of conspiracy. Given Mirellia's influence and the quality of her investigation into the matter, this helped clear Naofumi's name beyond all about -- even the oafish Motoyasu was forced to recognize the Queen's words and turn against Malty. Mirellia was even prepared to execute the king and princess until Naofumi intervened and decided to punish them with humiliation and a loss of authority instead.  RELATED: Shield Hero: The Berserk-Style Power of Naofumi's Rage Shield Mirellia came to Naofumi's aid soon after the would-be ""beach episode"" at the Cal Mira archipelago, when an unexpected Wave arrived. Unlike the previous Waves, this would be a naval battle, and Mirellia personally led a small fleet of warships and soldiers to aid the four Cardinal Heroes in battle against a series of sea monsters. The queen proved her worth as a leader of men in that battle, commanding her fleet with a steady hand as the Cardinal Heroes took the lead against the Wave's strongest monsters.  The battle was a success, and Queen Mirellia will continue to aid Naofumi however she can against future Waves and other quests in Season 2. With a further authority to mobilize the other three Cardinal Heroes to help, Mirella is now poised to take center stage alongside Naofumi as Shield Hero continues.

With a further authority to mobilize the other three Cardinal Heroes to help, Mirella is now poised to take center stage alongside Naofumi as Shield Hero continues.

Home Anime How Dr. Stone Secretly Became Shonen's Batman    How Dr. Stone Secretly Became Shonen's Batman  By Louis Kemner Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Dr. Stone protagonist Ishigami Senku is a heroic investigator and inventor with surprising similarities to Batman.                 Dr. Stone is an edutainment anime series taking place in a far-future Stone Age where human civilization has long since rusted away, yielding to a primitive world of stone and the rule of the strong. Protagonist Ishigami Senku has other ideas, however. As a hopeful shonen hero, he's certain he can bring civilization back and usher in a better future.  Overall, Senku has little overlap with more traditional shonen heroes such as the rubbery pirate Luffy or even the sorcerer Itadori Yuji. Instead, Dr. Stone's lead is more like shonen's Batman -- without the gothic themes or personal angst. Senku is a merciful, resourceful and law-oriented hero who fights brutal villains with brains instead of brawn, making him worthy of any DC comic title. RELATED: How Science Fell in Love Became a Battle Shonen Anime          How Senku Built His Own Bat Family In Dr. Stone                Dr. Stone's Senku has many startling parallels with the Dark Knight, even if their personalities, settings and personal backstories differ greatly. In fact, not only is Senku a surprisingly accurate anime analog for Batman, he even has an entire Bat Family of his own: a group of trustworthy friends who all work together to help get the job done right.  To begin with, Senku recruited the curious ""sorcerer"" Chrome, who soon became his enthusiastic scientist apprentice similar to Batman taking on Jason Todd/Robin as his sidekick. Like Robin, Chrome is largely content to play second fiddle -- though he sometimes enjoys showing off his inventions, including re-creating 21st century devices without even realizing it. Senku then recruited his own Catwoman, the agile warrior/hunter Kohaku, who is personally loyal to him but also committed to her own cause. In this case, Kohaku has strong ties to her native Ishigami Village and her elder sister Ruri, the village priestess. Just the way Catwoman is sometimes Batman's ally and lover, Kohaku helps Senku whenever she can, though their relationship is largely platonic.  RELATED: Dr. Stone's Final Chapter Turns Senku Into Terminator's John Connor Senku, as the Stone Age Batman, also has his own Lucius Fox: the elderly craftsman Kaseki, who can build just about anything. Just the way Lucius helps Batman purchase or create new weapons and gadgets, Kaseki aids Senku by expertly crafting items such as glass flasks and thin strands of gold wire, and indeed, Senku wouldn't have gotten very far without him. Batman is an expert at using his tools, but not even he can invent everything himself. Finally, Senku gathered all these allies into his own bat cave -- his Kingdom of Science -- complete with its own flag. This secluded miniature kingdom was kept apart from Ishigami Village and Tsukasa's Empire of Might, which could each be considered Gotham City. Senku is committed to uniting all people under his banner of justice to create a better future, but he can only do so if he keeps his distance and can work in secret. Every hero needs their own bat cave.  RELATED: Nami and Kalifa Battle in New One Piece Illustration By Dr. Stone Artist          Ishigami Senku As Batman In Dr. Stone                 Many facets of Senku's character and various scenes or instances in Dr. Stone clearly establish him as the Batman of modern shonen. He's a crafty inventor who relies on brains rather than brawn to defeat his mighty foes, and he shares Batman's sense of mercy and compassion. Neither will take a life for any reason, and they aren't too fond of deadly weapons either. Both are stubbornly optimistic that they can bloodlessly defeat their foes to create a better future for all, either in the Stone Age or Gotham, and this has inspired other people to join them with the power of friendship.  By recruiting Chrome as his own Robin and Kohaku as Catwoman, Senku quickly built up his own bat family -- especially when Kaseki joined the crew and, later, the entirety of Ishigami Village. It wasn't easy though; Senku had to fight his own Bane more than once, such as the thuggish Magma and certainly Tsukasa, having to use his Batman-style wits and inventions to win the day without brute force or bloodshed. He and his ""bat family"" defeated Magma to make Senku the tribe's chief, and that in turn allowed Senku to administer medicine to the afflicted Ruri. The Stone Wars later began, and Senku reinvented walkie talkies and flash-bang grenades to compensate for his team's lack of strength against Tsukasa's own forces. In fact, the Dr. Stone protagonist even created a steam-powered car with bamboo weave tires as a battering ram, thus creating his own Batmobile in the Stone Age to win the day. That's a Batman anime moment if there ever was one.

By Jessie Xu Published 21 minutes ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Enmu has been a mysterious character in Demon Slayer from the start, but one topic has been hotly debated: the demon's gender.                 The most powerful demons in Demon Slayer are called the Twelve Kizuki (Demon Moons), who are further divided into six Upper Ranks and six Lower Ranks. The Lower Ranks were later all slaughtered by Muzan in disdain of their weakness, with the exception of one: Enmu.  Enmu is the Lower Rank One demon, and the primary antagonist in the Mugen Train Arc, who appears as a young man of average height with shoulder-length black hair tinged with pink, and blue eyes that have the kanji for ""Lower One"" etched into the irises. These neutral features, as well as a slow, drawling voice, can make Enmu's gender seem ambiguous. RELATED: Who Is Upper-Rank One in Demon Slayer?                Despite that, Enmu is, in fact, male -- and one with sadistic tendencies. He is one of the few demons throughout Demon Slayer that appears totally irredeemable, because he enjoys watching the suffering of humans.  His utter devotion to Muzan was also what saved Enmu when faced with impending death. While the rest of the Lower Moons begged for their lives, or tried to save themselves from slaughter, Enmu faced Muzan with an expression of reverence. That deviation was outside of Muzan’s expectations. As a character who enjoys feeling superior, Muzan spared Enmu, and instead gave him more blood -- and another opportunity to prove himself. Enmu took that opportunity, and his newfound power, to hatch a nefarious plot. He merged with the Mugen Train, intending to take its passengers as his victims. Most of Enmu’s skills center around his ability to manipulate dreams and reality. He can put people to sleep in his dream realm and show them beautiful, idealistic visions, or present them with the most heart-wrenching nightmares. It's that dynamic that challenges Tanjiro’s fortitude throughout the Mugen Train Arc.  RELATED: Why Does Muzan Hate Doma of the Twelve Kizuki in Demon Slayer?                When Tanjiro and his companions boarded the train to investigate a series of mysterious disappearances, Enmu dragged them into a dream realm with the intent of killing them in their sleep. However, he cruelly borrowed the hands of four vulnerable children with terminal illnesses to perform that deed, luring them with the promise of an eternity of happy dreams. Tanjiro found himself in a world of peace where his family is alive and well, a reality he had long wished for, but one that he cannot regain. Despite how easy it would have been to simply lose himself in this false but idealistic world, with the assistance of Nezuko, Tanjiro forced himself back to reality.  That is the true cruelty of Enmu. He takes advantage of people’s deepest desires and regrets, and turns it against them. His utter devotion to Muzan, as well as his genuine enjoyment of human suffering, separates him from other demons.                  Demon Slayer: Why Did Muzan Kill Tanjiro's Family?

Spy x Family is probably the most hyped-up new show of anime's spring season. It might even be the most anticipated anime debut of 2022. Not only is it an adaptation of one of the most critically acclaimed manga of the last decade, but the anime is also being produced by Wit Studio (Ranking of Kings, Vivy: Fluorite Eyes' Song) and CloverWorks (My Dress-Up Darling, Wonder Egg Priority) -- two of the highest-profile animation studios in Japan. It's an understatement to say that the Spy x Family anime is premiering to extremely high expectations. Thankfully, the first episode of the anime lives up to those lofty expectations and may be one of the rare adaptations that manage to improve its source material.  The first episode of the show introduces viewers to the world-renowned super spy who is only known by his code name, Twilight. After deftly defusing an attempt to smear a powerful politician in the show's intro, Twilight is assigned his most challenging mission ever. This mission requires him to pretend to be an average family man to get close to his next target, a dangerous political leader who only appears in public to attend events held by the prestigious private academy his son attends. In order to infiltrate the school, Twilight takes on the alias ""Loid Forger"" and adopts a seemingly normal little girl, Anya. Unfortunately for him, his daughter has a secret of her own: she is an escaped experiment with psychic powers, which she immediately uses to discover her new father's double identity.  RELATED: Spy X Family Is Japan's Most Anticipated New Anime The new show manages to perfectly translate the humor from Tatsuya Endo's original manga. From the absurdity of the toupee-based conspiracy in the intro to Anya's reactions whenever she reads her father's purely espionage-focused thoughts, the first episode is loaded with multiple laugh-out-loud moments. There are even a few gags that are improved in the anime, such as the scene where Anya attempts to stealthily follow her super-spy father out of the house. The comedy is also improved thanks to excellent voice acting from Haikyuu's Takuya Eguchi, who perfectly captures Loid's world-weary yet empathetic personality with his performance. Atsumi Tanezaki, who previously starred in Mob Psycho 100, is also perfectly cast as Anya, whom she manages to portray as being adorably naive without being cloying.  Another aspect of the show that is improved with animation is the series' brief action scenes, which are animated with all the smoothness and impact you'd expect from both Wit Studio and CloverWorks. While the animation doesn't quite match the best moments from Vivy: Fluorite Eyes' Song's chaotic battles or the loving attention to detail that was displayed in My Dress-Up Darling, it's still a great-looking show in its own right. Action isn't the focus of the series, but the first episode makes it clear that the team behind the show is more than capable of choreographing and animating an exciting, impactful brawl for the scenes that require Loid to get his hands dirty.  RELATED: Spy X Family Creator Shares Adorable New Art for Series’ Anniversary With that said, the anime wouldn't live up to the award-winning manga if Spy x Family didn't also manage to translate the original work's tangible feelings of warmth and familial tenderness. Thankfully, those key elements of the series appear to have been ported over fully intact. Even within its first episode, it's hard to not feel something when Loid and Anya celebrate their first victories together and show the first hints of a true father-daughter bond. These moments were the most memorable parts of Endo's manga, and they're also the best parts of the anime's premiere episode. In less than half an hour, the show manages to give you an idea of who Loid and Anya really are, and makes you want to see the dysfunctional family succeed.  Judged only on its spot-on comedy and action, Spy x Family would already be in the running for the best series of the last decade, but the series' more heartfelt moments elevate it to potentially being one of the best anime and manga series of all time.

10-04-2022,anime,8,0,https://www.cbr.com/spy-x-family-anime-review/,Spy X Family Anime TV Review,"      Home Anime Spy x Family Crafts a Heartfelt Adaptation of Tatsuya Endo's Beloved Manga    Spy x Family Crafts a Heartfelt Adaptation of Tatsuya Endo's Beloved Manga  By Michael Lacerna Published 22 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   The new show brings Tatsuya Endo's award-winning manga to life while retaining all of the laughs and warmth that made the original work so special.                 Spy x Family is probably the most hyped-up new show of anime's spring season. It might even be the most anticipated anime debut of 2022. Not only is it an adaptation of one of the most critically acclaimed manga of the last decade, but the anime is also being produced by Wit Studio (Ranking of Kings, Vivy: Fluorite Eyes' Song) and CloverWorks (My Dress-Up Darling, Wonder Egg Priority) -- two of the highest-profile animation studios in Japan. It's an understatement to say that the Spy x Family anime is premiering to extremely high expectations. Thankfully, the first episode of the anime lives up to those lofty expectations and may be one of the rare adaptations that manage to improve its source material.  The first episode of the show introduces viewers to the world-renowned super spy who is only known by his code name, Twilight. After deftly defusing an attempt to smear a powerful politician in the show's intro, Twilight is assigned his most challenging mission ever. This mission requires him to pretend to be an average family man to get close to his next target, a dangerous political leader who only appears in public to attend events held by the prestigious private academy his son attends. In order to infiltrate the school, Twilight takes on the alias ""Loid Forger"" and adopts a seemingly normal little girl, Anya. Unfortunately for him, his daughter has a secret of her own: she is an escaped experiment with psychic powers, which she immediately uses to discover her new father's double identity.  RELATED: Spy X Family Is Japan's Most Anticipated New Anime The new show manages to perfectly translate the humor from Tatsuya Endo's original manga. From the absurdity of the toupee-based conspiracy in the intro to Anya's reactions whenever she reads her father's purely espionage-focused thoughts, the first episode is loaded with multiple laugh-out-loud moments. There are even a few gags that are improved in the anime, such as the scene where Anya attempts to stealthily follow her super-spy father out of the house. The comedy is also improved thanks to excellent voice acting from Haikyuu's Takuya Eguchi, who perfectly captures Loid's world-weary yet empathetic personality with his performance. Atsumi Tanezaki, who previously starred in Mob Psycho 100, is also perfectly cast as Anya, whom she manages to portray as being adorably naive without being cloying.  Another aspect of the show that is improved with animation is the series' brief action scenes, which are animated with all the smoothness and impact you'd expect from both Wit Studio and CloverWorks. While the animation doesn't quite match the best moments from Vivy: Fluorite Eyes' Song's chaotic battles or the loving attention to detail that was displayed in My Dress-Up Darling, it's still a great-looking show in its own right. Action isn't the focus of the series, but the first episode makes it clear that the team behind the show is more than capable of choreographing and animating an exciting, impactful brawl for the scenes that require Loid to get his hands dirty.  RELATED: Spy X Family Creator Shares Adorable New Art for Series’ Anniversary With that said, the anime wouldn't live up to the award-winning manga if Spy x Family didn't also manage to translate the original work's tangible feelings of warmth and familial tenderness. Thankfully, those key elements of the series appear to have been ported over fully intact. Even within its first episode, it's hard to not feel something when Loid and Anya celebrate their first victories together and show the first hints of a true father-daughter bond. These moments were the most memorable parts of Endo's manga, and they're also the best parts of the anime's premiere episode. In less than half an hour, the show manages to give you an idea of who Loid and Anya really are, and makes you want to see the dysfunctional family succeed.  Judged only on its spot-on comedy and action, Spy x Family would already be in the running for the best series of the last decade, but the series' more heartfelt moments elevate it to potentially being one of the best anime and manga series of all time. If the rest of the season can keep up the level of quality displayed in the first episode, then anime fans are truly in for something special. Spy x Family is being simulcast on Crunchyroll.

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness actor Elizabeth Olsen revealed that she finds Wanda Maximoff a more interesting character to portray than some other Marvel superheroes, thanks to her moral ambiguity.  As reported by The Direct, Olsen shared at the official press release for the upcoming Doctor Strange film that she has really enjoyed playing a morally gray hero. ""It’s not the most fun, in my mind, to always play the hero of a story where they do no wrong,"" she said. ""I don’t find that interesting. I think the reason why I really enjoyed Wanda from the beginning is that she’s very clear in her beliefs. They just don’t align with others, and that’s okay. She'll have her own realizations and admit when she makes mistakes."" RELATED: Marvel Edits Doctor Strange 2 International Poster Over 'Offensive' Hand Gesture  Olsen is likely referring to the events of last year's Disney+ series, WandaVision, where Wanda took over the entire town of Westview with her magic in order to live out her fantasy of a life with fellow Avenger Vision, who had been killed by Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War. While the series ended with the newly named ""Scarlet Witch"" freeing the residents of Westview from her spell, the final shot of the series showed Wanda attempting to master the Darkhold, a book of dark magic, presumably to try and bring her family back. Wanda is not the only Avenger who will be on a journey of self-discovery, however. Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays Doctor Strange, also stated that his character will confront versions of himself across the multiverse and learn more about himself in the process. ""Strange sees, through his experience in the Multiverse and the various versions of him in the Multiverse, how much of a pattern of behavior he carries,"" Cumberbatch explained. ""It’s a kind of imprint, an identification of who Doctor Stephen Strange is in any universe and what the dangers of that character are. Is he going to be the hero to his enemy or the enemy to his hero? Who is our Doctor Strange in the Multiverse? He’s literally coming up against versions of himself to figure that out.""  RELATED: America Chavez Co-Creator Slams Marvel's 'Insulting' Doctor Strange 2 Offer Directed by Sam Raimi, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness takes place a few months after the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home, with Dr. Stephen Strange and his team venturing into the multiverse to face a new enemy who threatens to tear the fabric of their world wide open. Alongside Cumberbatch and Olsen, the film also features Benedict Wong, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Xochitl Gomez, Michael Stuhlbarg and Rachel McAdams.

Crunchyroll is also streaming new seasons of Ascendance of a Bookworm and Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story. The anime streaming giant recently removed over fifty titles from its catalog. The removal included both popular series, like Is It Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?, Food Wars: Shogeki No Shoma, Akame ga Kill! and No Game No Life, as well as more obscure shows, like Sunday Without God, The Pet Girl of Sakurasou, Is The Order a Rabbit?, Infinite Stratos and Familiar of Zero F.

Unfortunately, some characters won't ever get a rematch.                  Akira Toriyama’s Dragon Ball has achieved legendary status that’s kept it at the forefront of the anime industry for nearly four decades. Dragon Ball chronicles the heroic adventures of Goku and his courageous friends who tirelessly fight to protect the planet from danger. There’s a huge cast, incredible energy techniques, and powerful transformations that keep Dragon Ball fresh, but the series always knows when to expand its boundaries and head into new territory.  RELATED: Dragon Ball: 10 Fights That Dragged On Too Long The thrilling battles that punctuate Dragon Ball’s climaxes are one of the most celebrated aspects of the series. Characters occasionally get multiple opportunities to prove themselves and work out their aggression, but the opposite is also true. There are some Dragon Ball rematches that would function as major events, but are likely lost causes at this point.  10          Another Fight Between Saiyan Siblings, Goku And Raditz, Isn’t Happening                The bulk of Dragon Ball’s villains have found ways to weasel back into the picture and get another chance at success. However, some of Dragon Ball’s most interesting foes are the fleeting ones that appear at the start of the series. Dragon Ball Z’s first real fight pushes Goku and Piccolo to work together as they take on invading alien, Raditz. Raditz sufficiently showcases Saiyan strength, but the battle is especially emotional since the enemy is Goku’s estranged brother. There’s so much potential in the idea of a rematch between these Saiyan siblings, but this window has likely closed.  9          Bardock Won’t Get A Second Chance To Show His Winning Strategy Over Gas                There are certain rematches between Dragon Ball juggernauts that audiences have been waiting to see for hundreds of episodes, but there are also feuds that are considerably more recent. Gas is Dragon Ball Super’s latest antagonist and the dangerous member of the Heeter Force actually has a curious history with Bardock, Goku’s father. Goku currently struggles to conquer Gas’ power, but it’s something that Bardock was somehow able to accomplish. Bardock’s deceased status makes it highly unlikely that he’ll show up to take out Gas and save the day for Goku.  8          Vegeta And Nappa’s Lengthy History Remains In The Past                Vegeta first appears in Dragon Ball Z as a serious threat to Earth’s future, and it doesn’t take long for a fiery rivalry to form between him and Goku. Vegeta and Goku grow into an iconic Saiyan team, but for years Vegeta engaged in destruction with his partner, Nappa. RELATED: Dragon Ball: 10 Short Fights That Needed To Be Longer Nappa devastates Earth’s weaker heroes, but he’s no match for Goku, which causes Vegeta to cut his losses with the dead weight. Nappa, like Raditz, has mostly remained deceased. An extremely brief reunion between Vegeta and Nappa occurs during Dragon Ball GT’s jailbreak from hell, but it’s unlikely a more substantial rematch ever occurs.  7          An Older Gotenks And Lean Buu Deserve To Duel                Self-improvement isn’t always enough in Dragon Ball, which is where the collaborative process of fusion comes into play. Fusion allows two individuals to combine their strength and abilities into one powerful package. A lot of stock is put on fused fighter, Gotenks, and how he might be strong enough to defeat Buu in his Super Saiyan 3 state. Gotenks isn’t successful, but a helpful version of Buu joins the heroes after the fact. Dragon Ball Super hasn’t done much with Buu, but he briefly gets in shape during his preparation for the Tournament of Power. A new clash of powers between these two would have been a delight.  6          Cabba And Vegeta’s Moment For Collaboration Has Passed                The appearance of a new Saiyan is always reason for celebration in Dragon Ball, but Super goes above and beyond in this regard. Universe 6 and 7 are frequently pitted against each other in competition, which allows Goku and the rest of the universe’s Saiyans to get close with Cabba, Caulifla, and Kale. Cabba exhibits a lot of reverence towards Vegeta’s regal status and is just as interested in training under him as he is in sparring against him. Dragon Ball Super sets up some one-on-one time between these two, but it’s been so long without this promise getting fulfilled that the moment has likely passed.  5          Goku And Pikkon Are The Pride Of The North Quadrant’s Fallen Fighters                A debate rages on between Dragon Ball purists and those who want more incorporation from the anime’s filler material. Pikkon is one of the more popular anime-only characters. The deceased fighter first crosses paths with Goku in the Other World Tournament, where he proves himself as the Super Saiyan’s equal. RELATED: Dragon Ball: 7 Classic Fights That Would Have Been Better With Ki Impressively, Pikkon also plays an important role in the film Fusion Reborn and is a common participant in video games. Many hoped that recruitment for the Tournament of Power would result in an invitation extended out to Pikkon, but Super’s decision to ignore the individual is probably a confirmation that a rematch isn’t happening.  4          Piccolo Won’t Get To Show His Improvement In Another Battle Against Universe 6’s Frost                Piccolo experiences a significant power upgrade on Planet Namek when he fuses with Nail and proves himself against Frieza’s second form. A full-on rematch between Piccolo and Frieza would be incredible after how much they’ve grown, but it’s something that might actually happen with Frieza’s reintegration into the story. Alternatively, Universe 6’s Frieza counterpart, Frost, faces against Piccolo during Universe 7’s tournament against Champa’s best fighters. Frost is fascinating when his intentions are a mystery, but he recedes into the background after he’s exposed as a lesser version of Frieza.  3          A Super Saiyan 4 Showdown Against Anyone Is Extremely Unlikely                Contrary to popular opinion, Dragon Ball GT isn’t a dumpster fire anime sequel. Dragon Ball GT takes some time to find its footing, but it explores some genuinely creative ideas, which unfortunately have largely been undone through the events of Dragon Ball Super. One of Dragon Ball GT’s longest lasting legacies is its unique Super Saiyan 4 transformation. Dragon Ball Super opts for Super Saiyan God and Super Saiyan Blue instead of the GT counterpart, which means that it’s unlikely that there will be a legitimate rematch between any Super Saiyan 4 with anyone (other than in video games and the promotional series, Super Dragon Ball Heroes).  2          Audiences Have Waited Decades For A Gohan And Cell Reunion                Goku usually steals the spotlight when it comes to the elimination of Dragon Ball’s biggest opponents, which is exactly why Gohan’s Super Saiyan 2 debut and subsequent destruction of Cell remains a high point for the series. Gohan has only grown more powerful since his fight against Cell, and it’d make sense if the same was also true for his opponent. There are rumors that Cell makes his grand return in the upcoming movie, Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, which is the perfect opportunity for a rematch against a grown-up Gohan. This remains wishful thinking and Dragon Ball fans have gotten used to the idea that Cell’s a permanent casualty.  1          Goku And Jiren’s Clash Is The Tournament Of Power’s Apex                Villains of unprecedented power show up in Dragon Ball Super, but the multiversal battle royale competition, the Tournament of Power, becomes the anime’s ultimate test. The strongest warriors from across the multiverse compete in the face of the universes’ potential erasure. Goku and Universe 7 hold their own, but Universe 11’s Jiren quickly proves himself to be Goku’s toughest competition. Jiren’s perseverance and strength pushes Goku to dip into Ultra Instinct power for the first time, which is a milestone for the franchise. Jiren is still alive and he and Goku aren’t on poor terms, but it seems as if Dragon Ball considers Jiren to be in its past.

There are some Dragon Ball rematches that would function as major events, but are likely lost causes at this point.  10          Another Fight Between Saiyan Siblings, Goku And Raditz, Isn’t Happening                The bulk of Dragon Ball’s villains have found ways to weasel back into the picture and get another chance at success. However, some of Dragon Ball’s most interesting foes are the fleeting ones that appear at the start of the series. Dragon Ball Z’s first real fight pushes Goku and Piccolo to work together as they take on invading alien, Raditz. Raditz sufficiently showcases Saiyan strength, but the battle is especially emotional since the enemy is Goku’s estranged brother. There’s so much potential in the idea of a rematch between these Saiyan siblings, but this window has likely closed.  9          Bardock Won’t Get A Second Chance To Show His Winning Strategy Over Gas                There are certain rematches between Dragon Ball juggernauts that audiences have been waiting to see for hundreds of episodes, but there are also feuds that are considerably more recent. Gas is Dragon Ball Super’s latest antagonist and the dangerous member of the Heeter Force actually has a curious history with Bardock, Goku’s father. Goku currently struggles to conquer Gas’ power, but it’s something that Bardock was somehow able to accomplish. Bardock’s deceased status makes it highly unlikely that he’ll show up to take out Gas and save the day for Goku.  8          Vegeta And Nappa’s Lengthy History Remains In The Past                Vegeta first appears in Dragon Ball Z as a serious threat to Earth’s future, and it doesn’t take long for a fiery rivalry to form between him and Goku. Vegeta and Goku grow into an iconic Saiyan team, but for years Vegeta engaged in destruction with his partner, Nappa. RELATED: Dragon Ball: 10 Short Fights That Needed To Be Longer Nappa devastates Earth’s weaker heroes, but he’s no match for Goku, which causes Vegeta to cut his losses with the dead weight. Nappa, like Raditz, has mostly remained deceased. An extremely brief reunion between Vegeta and Nappa occurs during Dragon Ball GT’s jailbreak from hell, but it’s unlikely a more substantial rematch ever occurs.  7          An Older Gotenks And Lean Buu Deserve To Duel                Self-improvement isn’t always enough in Dragon Ball, which is where the collaborative process of fusion comes into play. Fusion allows two individuals to combine their strength and abilities into one powerful package. A lot of stock is put on fused fighter, Gotenks, and how he might be strong enough to defeat Buu in his Super Saiyan 3 state. Gotenks isn’t successful, but a helpful version of Buu joins the heroes after the fact. Dragon Ball Super hasn’t done much with Buu, but he briefly gets in shape during his preparation for the Tournament of Power. A new clash of powers between these two would have been a delight.  6          Cabba And Vegeta’s Moment For Collaboration Has Passed                The appearance of a new Saiyan is always reason for celebration in Dragon Ball, but Super goes above and beyond in this regard. Universe 6 and 7 are frequently pitted against each other in competition, which allows Goku and the rest of the universe’s Saiyans to get close with Cabba, Caulifla, and Kale. Cabba exhibits a lot of reverence towards Vegeta’s regal status and is just as interested in training under him as he is in sparring against him. Dragon Ball Super sets up some one-on-one time between these two, but it’s been so long without this promise getting fulfilled that the moment has likely passed.  5          Goku And Pikkon Are The Pride Of The North Quadrant’s Fallen Fighters                A debate rages on between Dragon Ball purists and those who want more incorporation from the anime’s filler material. Pikkon is one of the more popular anime-only characters. The deceased fighter first crosses paths with Goku in the Other World Tournament, where he proves himself as the Super Saiyan’s equal. RELATED: Dragon Ball: 7 Classic Fights That Would Have Been Better With Ki Impressively, Pikkon also plays an important role in the film Fusion Reborn and is a common participant in video games. Many hoped that recruitment for the Tournament of Power would result in an invitation extended out to Pikkon, but Super’s decision to ignore the individual is probably a confirmation that a rematch isn’t happening.  4          Piccolo Won’t Get To Show His Improvement In Another Battle Against Universe 6’s Frost                Piccolo experiences a significant power upgrade on Planet Namek when he fuses with Nail and proves himself against Frieza’s second form. A full-on rematch between Piccolo and Frieza would be incredible after how much they’ve grown, but it’s something that might actually happen with Frieza’s reintegration into the story. Alternatively, Universe 6’s Frieza counterpart, Frost, faces against Piccolo during Universe 7’s tournament against Champa’s best fighters. Frost is fascinating when his intentions are a mystery, but he recedes into the background after he’s exposed as a lesser version of Frieza.  3          A Super Saiyan 4 Showdown Against Anyone Is Extremely Unlikely                Contrary to popular opinion, Dragon Ball GT isn’t a dumpster fire anime sequel. Dragon Ball GT takes some time to find its footing, but it explores some genuinely creative ideas, which unfortunately have largely been undone through the events of Dragon Ball Super. One of Dragon Ball GT’s longest lasting legacies is its unique Super Saiyan 4 transformation. Dragon Ball Super opts for Super Saiyan God and Super Saiyan Blue instead of the GT counterpart, which means that it’s unlikely that there will be a legitimate rematch between any Super Saiyan 4 with anyone (other than in video games and the promotional series, Super Dragon Ball Heroes).  2          Audiences Have Waited Decades For A Gohan And Cell Reunion                Goku usually steals the spotlight when it comes to the elimination of Dragon Ball’s biggest opponents, which is exactly why Gohan’s Super Saiyan 2 debut and subsequent destruction of Cell remains a high point for the series. Gohan has only grown more powerful since his fight against Cell, and it’d make sense if the same was also true for his opponent. There are rumors that Cell makes his grand return in the upcoming movie, Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, which is the perfect opportunity for a rematch against a grown-up Gohan. This remains wishful thinking and Dragon Ball fans have gotten used to the idea that Cell’s a permanent casualty.  1          Goku And Jiren’s Clash Is The Tournament Of Power’s Apex                Villains of unprecedented power show up in Dragon Ball Super, but the multiversal battle royale competition, the Tournament of Power, becomes the anime’s ultimate test. The strongest warriors from across the multiverse compete in the face of the universes’ potential erasure. Goku and Universe 7 hold their own, but Universe 11’s Jiren quickly proves himself to be Goku’s toughest competition. Jiren’s perseverance and strength pushes Goku to dip into Ultra Instinct power for the first time, which is a milestone for the franchise. Jiren is still alive and he and Goku aren’t on poor terms, but it seems as if Dragon Ball considers Jiren to be in its past.

The following contains spoilers for Spy x Family Chapter 62.1 by Tatsuya Endo, Casey Loe and Rina Mapa, available in English now via Viz Media.   In Spy x Family, not much is known about Twilight's past despite the readers having been with him on his family shenanigans and his missions. The only few details that have been revealed are that he abandoned his old life in favor of the life of a spy. Having lost his parents in the war, Twilight's motivation to maintain peace between Westalis and Ostania is so there will not be any other orphans like him. He wanted to create a world where children wouldn't have to cry.  Even though Twilight has no experience being a parent, he is undoubtedly a good father. While he is adamant that the Forger family is nothing but a facade, he nonetheless would be willing to put himself in danger to protect Anya, Yor and Bond. This week's chapter of Spy x Family dives into Twilight's past -- before he was Twilight -- and the events that made him the man he is. RELATED: Why Spy x Family's Plot, Premise & Characters Make the Series So Good                 If there was any hope that readers would get to know Twilight's real name since this chapter focused on his childhood, those hopes were quickly dashed; the chapter cheekily blacked out his name. As a boy, Twilight spent most of his days playing war with his friends in an abandoned depot. He and his friends quickly become infatuated with the idea of being soldiers. At home, however, Twilight immediately hides his toy gun from his father.  Twilight's father is an interesting and rather contradictory character. Upon seeing how eager his son is to go to war to find ""those awful monsters from the East,"" he immediately slaps him. It's not clear if this is a common recurrence, but the fact that his father's first instinct was to hit his son is already concerning. What's more, Twilight's childhood seems to be marred with instances of fights between his mother and father. While the slap is unjustified and should never have been done, his father's anger is understandable. All the sentiments around the Ostanians being ""monsters"" are propaganda fed by those in Westalis. Instead of hoping for war, Twilight's father says to his son that he should hope for peace.  That's exactly what adult Twilight's mission is -- to maintain peace between Ostania and Westalis so that war doesn't break out. His father's words left a strong enough impact for him to carry that through to his adult life. And although Twilight's father insisted that violence would never achieve peace, Twilight's line of work does demand a certain level of violence in order to protect the powerless. It's not specified, but Twilight's father's job appears to be diplomatic in nature, and he may have worked in a department that maintained peace at the border.  RELATED: Why Spy x Family's Anya Is the Best Girl of the Series                 Knowing who Twilight is now and his occupation, it's endearing to see what he was like when he was a child. Adult Twilight can lie with ease and disguise himself flawlessly in the blink of an eye. Twilight as a boy feels absolutely guilty when he has to lie to his father for pocket money to buy the soldier set. Even after getting the gun, he can't go through with playing with it and returns home. After talking to the croquette lady and realizing that the Ostanians may not be as monstrous as they have been portrayed, Twilight wants to return home and apologize to his father.  Sadly, Twilight doesn't get a chance to do that. A bomb crashes into the town of Luwen, destroying the depot that Twilight's friends were playing in just a few hours ago, leaving nothing but the ""KEEP OUT"" sign lying in the rubble. The chapter doesn't confirm whether or not Twilight's friends managed to escape before they were killed, but it doesn't look optimistic. Despite having never been a father before, it's made abundantly clear that Twilight's parenting style was influenced by his own father. He would never raise a hand to Anya, and his parenting is usually much more gentle and gives off heartwarming vibes. This is a Twilight who never wants to inflict the same pain on his child (even if Anya is his fake daughter) that he endured when he was young.  It's hard to remember that Spy x Family is set during a time when war could erupt at any moment. All of the comedic moments are what make Spy x Family so enjoyable, but moments like these with Twilight's backstory make readers realize that this is what makes the manga so special.

The following contains spoilers for Spy x Family Chapter 62.1 by Tatsuya Endo, Casey Loe and Rina Mapa, available in English now via Viz Media.   In Spy x Family, not much is known about Twilight's past despite the readers having been with him on his family shenanigans and his missions. The only few details that have been revealed are that he abandoned his old life in favor of the life of a spy. Having lost his parents in the war, Twilight's motivation to maintain peace between Westalis and Ostania is so there will not be any other orphans like him. He wanted to create a world where children wouldn't have to cry.  Even though Twilight has no experience being a parent, he is undoubtedly a good father. While he is adamant that the Forger family is nothing but a facade, he nonetheless would be willing to put himself in danger to protect Anya, Yor and Bond. This week's chapter of Spy x Family dives into Twilight's past -- before he was Twilight -- and the events that made him the man he is. RELATED: Why Spy x Family's Plot, Premise & Characters Make the Series So Good                 If there was any hope that readers would get to know Twilight's real name since this chapter focused on his childhood, those hopes were quickly dashed; the chapter cheekily blacked out his name. As a boy, Twilight spent most of his days playing war with his friends in an abandoned depot. He and his friends quickly become infatuated with the idea of being soldiers. At home, however, Twilight immediately hides his toy gun from his father.  Twilight's father is an interesting and rather contradictory character. Upon seeing how eager his son is to go to war to find ""those awful monsters from the East,"" he immediately slaps him. It's not clear if this is a common recurrence, but the fact that his father's first instinct was to hit his son is already concerning. What's more, Twilight's childhood seems to be marred with instances of fights between his mother and father. While the slap is unjustified and should never have been done, his father's anger is understandable. All the sentiments around the Ostanians being ""monsters"" are propaganda fed by those in Westalis. Instead of hoping for war, Twilight's father says to his son that he should hope for peace.  That's exactly what adult Twilight's mission is -- to maintain peace between Ostania and Westalis so that war doesn't break out. His father's words left a strong enough impact for him to carry that through to his adult life. And although Twilight's father insisted that violence would never achieve peace, Twilight's line of work does demand a certain level of violence in order to protect the powerless. It's not specified, but Twilight's father's job appears to be diplomatic in nature, and he may have worked in a department that maintained peace at the border.  RELATED: Why Spy x Family's Anya Is the Best Girl of the Series                 Knowing who Twilight is now and his occupation, it's endearing to see what he was like when he was a child. Adult Twilight can lie with ease and disguise himself flawlessly in the blink of an eye. Twilight as a boy feels absolutely guilty when he has to lie to his father for pocket money to buy the soldier set. Even after getting the gun, he can't go through with playing with it and returns home. After talking to the croquette lady and realizing that the Ostanians may not be as monstrous as they have been portrayed, Twilight wants to return home and apologize to his father.  Sadly, Twilight doesn't get a chance to do that. A bomb crashes into the town of Luwen, destroying the depot that Twilight's friends were playing in just a few hours ago, leaving nothing but the ""KEEP OUT"" sign lying in the rubble. The chapter doesn't confirm whether or not Twilight's friends managed to escape before they were killed, but it doesn't look optimistic. Despite having never been a father before, it's made abundantly clear that Twilight's parenting style was influenced by his own father. He would never raise a hand to Anya, and his parenting is usually much more gentle and gives off heartwarming vibes. This is a Twilight who never wants to inflict the same pain on his child (even if Anya is his fake daughter) that he endured when he was young.  It's hard to remember that Spy x Family is set during a time when war could erupt at any moment. All of the comedic moments are what make Spy x Family so enjoyable, but moments like these with Twilight's backstory make readers realize that this is what makes the manga so special.

By Hilary Leung Published 21 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Azuma faces off against Umezawa, but is he any match for the choujin?                  The following contains spoilers for Choujin X, Chapter 19 by Sui Ishida, Jan Cash and Snir Aharon, available in English from Viz Media and Manga Plus.   The horror elements really shine through in this week's chapter of Choujin X -- qualities that have made Ishida's artwork so iconic. After being rejected from tagging along on the rescue mission, Azuma takes matters into his own hands and sets off alone to save Tokio. Doubts had been floating around in the air regarding whether Azuma's intentions were genuine or not, but those doubts are resolved as his characterization becomes more fleshed out.  Ishida's artwork cannot be praised enough, especially in the fight scene between Azuma and Umezawa. It's striking and dynamic in a way that makes every kick and punch look that much harder. Azuma is a good fighter, but against a formidable opponent like Umezawa, what hope does he really have to win? RELATED: Attack on Titan's New Antagonist May Have Topped Shiganshina's Death Toll                 The chapter opens with Azuma sitting gloomily in front of his shelf full of awards and trophies. Even though Azuma doesn't have the more obvious traits of a choujin like Tokio who can transform into a vulture-like creature, the chapter drops hints that there may have been changes to Azuma's body as a result of the injection, such as the wheelchair implying that Azuma might be weaker than before.  As a non-choujin, Azuma knows that there's truth to Sato's words; he wouldn't stand a chance against any of the choujin and would only slow the rescue crew down if he accompanied them. However, he remembers what his father told him: ""To shirk justice is cowardice."" Azuma might be scared, but if he turned away from doing the right thing, not only would it be wrong but he would also be a coward. Back in Chapter 1, Azuma was the first to grab the syringe that contained the serum, and Tokio did the same because he wanted to remain friends with Azuma. Tokio risked his life to save Azuma. Now Azuma wants to do the same for Tokio.  He arrives at an abandoned motel where Umezawa awaits. Without wasting any time, Azuma swings a kick out at Umezawa, but she transforms into paper and slips out of his grasp. She warns him that if he continues on like this, he will die. Because Azuma is already quite good at fighting, he's able to land a few hits on Umezawa, with one of his kicks removing her mask. She uses her second ability called Paper Trip, which allows her to transform everything she touches into paper so that Azuma loses his footing. As soon as she finds an opening, Umezawa strikes, cutting off one of his ears as revenge for kicking her in the face.  RELATED: Which Anime to Watch After Finishing Tokyo Ghoul                 Umezawa is pretty perceptive. Even though Azuma seems adamant that all he wants to do is be a good friend, she accurately (or not) pinpoints that he's doing this to test himself in the hope that fighting a choujin might give him powers. This fight is part noble and part selfish in that regard. But she doesn't really care -- she's more angry that Azuma landed a kick on her, and she shows no mercy in retaliating. She truly gives a whole other meaning to the phrase 'Death by papercut' because by the end of it, Azuma is so severely wounded that it looks like he wouldn't be able to last more than a few more seconds.  Whenever Azuma isn't sure what to do, he remembers a time when his father took him to the railroad with two tracks diverging in two different directions. The tracks on the right lead to Yamato, but when Azuma asked his father where the ones on the left went, his father didn't answer. Instead, he led Azuma down the tracks, walking through the forest until they arrived at a blockade. The tracks on the left led to nowhere. Despite Azuma not knowing what the outcome of his choice in saving Tokio would be and that it would lead to a dead end, he still went to save him. The metaphor extends to Azuma's final moments just before Umezawa launches her final attack, when he remembers the two diverging railroad tracks in his childhood memory. Two paths, two choices. One path leads him to something that he's familiar with -- something safe -- while the other path leads only to a dead end. Just before Umezawa dismembers him, the lever switches, representing something being unlocked. It's possible that Azuma might have been unconsciously hindering himself from reaching his full potential as a choujin.  It will be difficult to wait for the next chapter of Choujin X to see what happened to Azuma. This is probably not the last time readers have seen him, but will they be witnessing the birth of a new choujin?

Even though Azuma doesn't have the more obvious traits of a choujin like Tokio who can transform into a vulture-like creature, the chapter drops hints that there may have been changes to Azuma's body as a result of the injection, such as the wheelchair implying that Azuma might be weaker than before.  As a non-choujin, Azuma knows that there's truth to Sato's words; he wouldn't stand a chance against any of the choujin and would only slow the rescue crew down if he accompanied them. However, he remembers what his father told him: ""To shirk justice is cowardice."" Azuma might be scared, but if he turned away from doing the right thing, not only would it be wrong but he would also be a coward. Back in Chapter 1, Azuma was the first to grab the syringe that contained the serum, and Tokio did the same because he wanted to remain friends with Azuma. Tokio risked his life to save Azuma. Now Azuma wants to do the same for Tokio.  He arrives at an abandoned motel where Umezawa awaits. Without wasting any time, Azuma swings a kick out at Umezawa, but she transforms into paper and slips out of his grasp. She warns him that if he continues on like this, he will die. Because Azuma is already quite good at fighting, he's able to land a few hits on Umezawa, with one of his kicks removing her mask. She uses her second ability called Paper Trip, which allows her to transform everything she touches into paper so that Azuma loses his footing. As soon as she finds an opening, Umezawa strikes, cutting off one of his ears as revenge for kicking her in the face.  RELATED: Which Anime to Watch After Finishing Tokyo Ghoul                 Umezawa is pretty perceptive. Even though Azuma seems adamant that all he wants to do is be a good friend, she accurately (or not) pinpoints that he's doing this to test himself in the hope that fighting a choujin might give him powers. This fight is part noble and part selfish in that regard. But she doesn't really care -- she's more angry that Azuma landed a kick on her, and she shows no mercy in retaliating. She truly gives a whole other meaning to the phrase 'Death by papercut' because by the end of it, Azuma is so severely wounded that it looks like he wouldn't be able to last more than a few more seconds.  Whenever Azuma isn't sure what to do, he remembers a time when his father took him to the railroad with two tracks diverging in two different directions. The tracks on the right lead to Yamato, but when Azuma asked his father where the ones on the left went, his father didn't answer. Instead, he led Azuma down the tracks, walking through the forest until they arrived at a blockade. The tracks on the left led to nowhere. Despite Azuma not knowing what the outcome of his choice in saving Tokio would be and that it would lead to a dead end, he still went to save him. The metaphor extends to Azuma's final moments just before Umezawa launches her final attack, when he remembers the two diverging railroad tracks in his childhood memory. Two paths, two choices. One path leads him to something that he's familiar with -- something safe -- while the other path leads only to a dead end. Just before Umezawa dismembers him, the lever switches, representing something being unlocked. It's possible that Azuma might have been unconsciously hindering himself from reaching his full potential as a choujin.  It will be difficult to wait for the next chapter of Choujin X to see what happened to Azuma. This is probably not the last time readers have seen him, but will they be witnessing the birth of a new choujin?

But I wasn't really into the anime scene. I watched it, and at first it had a great setup. But it fucking died by the 4th episode. Kirito is a dumbass edge-lord for no fucking reason. I don't even want to talk about this awful shit anymore. BUT. I will. The animation is ok, A-1 is talented when they try, this was a time when they did decent job.

The continuing story of Legosi and his internal struggles is a joy to follow, and leaves me hoping a Season 3 is on the books.  Story: Continuing from where Season 1 left off, Legosi and Louis set out to face the consequences of their attack on the Shishigumi/Lion Group. Their internal conflicts are told in parrallel with a very satisfying conclusion that perfectly contrasts their experiences. There are a number of moments that feel slightly forced, like the author couldn't quite make the next scene happen naturally, but overall the progression felt very convincing. 9/10; certainly not perfect, but immensely satisfying.  Animation: Top notch all the way through. The models, animation rigging, color palletes, and camera angles are all on point. Easily the best Full-CGI animation I've ever seen in an anime, and in many ways even better than some traditional-medium shows.  10/10; I'm excited to see where the studio takes this 3d animation in the future  Sound: Also top notch. Everything lines up perfectly, the voice acting is stellar, and the soundtrack is the sort that you find yourself humming in the shower out of nowhere. 10/10; absolutely amazing  Characters: While the main characters have strong convictions, they're presented as movable and impressionable. They claim ideals and proclaim motivations that they can later go back on after experiencing growth and change. They're dynamic and believable in almost every way. That said, a few of the side characters felt a fair bit less believable - is it because they didn't get enough screen time to fully flesh out their own growth? Perhaps. At any rate, this is a cut above many other anime, even despite my issues with a handful of characters. 8/10; If your only problem is that your side characters needed more of their own story told, I think you're in a good place.  Overall: While it's certainly not the best anime I've ever seen, it's absolutely one of the best anime in recent seasons and well worth a 5-star rating. This is the kind of show that I'll remember and have in the back of my mind for the rest of my life, and find myself comparing other anime and even non-anime shows to. 10/10; Perhaps not life-changing, but certainly life-influencing material.

This perfectly illustrates exactly what Beastars has in store for you. Split across 12 episodes of hand-drawn animation, Beastars is a well written, surprisingly reflective series that touches on issues of sexism and racism in a way that feels organic, using the animal-inhabited world to depict clear divides between carnivores and herbivores. All of this back-dropped by a murder and a thick dose of “whodunit” interwoven with these social issues.  The world of beastars is relatively simple but it works on a hierarchal level of carnivores and herbivores living harmoniously together. Most of the action during this first season takes place in Cherryton Academy, a fictional school that sees its foundations rocked when a shadowy carnivore murders a llama named Tem. As hostilities grow and the battle lines are drawn between the two sides, at the centre of this conflict lies a gentle wolf named Legoshi.  Playing out with a simple forbidden love angle, Legoshi finds himself infatuated with a dwarf rabbit named Haru and across the season we see their friendship grow while the school’s beastar (the most popular and top animal) Rouis become entangled in this with a light dose of a love triangle introduced. This story dances harmoniously with the “whodunit”, building up to a climactic few episodes where Haru’s life hangs in the balance and secrets are revealed before the open-ending ready for season 2.  Where Beastars shines though is with its visual design and aesthetic. Each episode showcases a different stylistic interpretation of animation, with everything from silhoutted lights and animal outlines used to paint a separate scene inside to split-screen shots and reflections, there’s an incredible array of talent used to show off the best hand-drawn animation can offer. There’s no question that a lot of animators are moving across to CGI-styled efforts but Beastars is a great example why this traditional method works as well as it does.  While it’s advisory to watch in the standard Japanese subbed version for authenticity, the English dub isn’t actually that bad.

This perfectly illustrates exactly what Beastars has in store for you. Split across 12 episodes of hand-drawn animation, Beastars is a well written, surprisingly reflective series that touches on issues of sexism and racism in a way that feels organic, using the animal-inhabited world to depict clear divides between carnivores and herbivores. All of this back-dropped by a murder and a thick dose of “whodunit” interwoven with these social issues.  The world of beastars is relatively simple but it works on a hierarchal level of carnivores and herbivores living harmoniously together. Most of the action during this first season takes place in Cherryton Academy, a fictional school that sees its foundations rocked when a shadowy carnivore murders a llama named Tem. As hostilities grow and the battle lines are drawn between the two sides, at the centre of this conflict lies a gentle wolf named Legoshi.  Playing out with a simple forbidden love angle, Legoshi finds himself infatuated with a dwarf rabbit named Haru and across the season we see their friendship grow while the school’s beastar (the most popular and top animal) Rouis become entangled in this with a light dose of a love triangle introduced. This story dances harmoniously with the “whodunit”, building up to a climactic few episodes where Haru’s life hangs in the balance and secrets are revealed before the open-ending ready for season 2.  Where Beastars shines though is with its visual design and aesthetic. Each episode showcases a different stylistic interpretation of animation, with everything from silhoutted lights and animal outlines used to paint a separate scene inside to split-screen shots and reflections, there’s an incredible array of talent used to show off the best hand-drawn animation can offer. There’s no question that a lot of animators are moving across to CGI-styled efforts but Beastars is a great example why this traditional method works as well as it does.  While it’s advisory to watch in the standard Japanese subbed version for authenticity, the English dub isn’t actually that bad. Haru and Legoshi have compelling voices attached to them and the various supporting players do well to flesh out the cast at the heart of this one.

The ground-breaking, 4-episode Original Video Animation (OVA) struck a chord with audiences worldwide with its blazingly fast dogfighting in detail that had never been seen in anime before. On December 14, “MACROSS” finally comes to U.S. cinemas with, “MACROSS PLUS MOVIE EDITION,” which adds all-new animated scenes never seen in the OVA, streamlines the storyline, and creates a more focused and action-packed viewing experience. In addition to the feature, attendees will view an exclusive special interview with creator/chief director Shoji Kawamori (“Macross,” “Aquarion,” “Escaflowne”).Tickets for “MACROSS PLUS MOVIE EDITION” can be purchased at www.FathomEvents.com or participating theater box offices. For a complete list of theater locations, visit the Fathom Events website (theater locations are subject to change).Combining the intricate designs of Shoji Kawamori, character direction from Shinichiro Watanabe (“Cowboy Bebop”), and the musical stylings of renown composer Yoko Kanno (“Cowboy Bebop,” “Ghost in The Shell: SAC”), “MACROSS PLUS MOVIE EDITION” takes place in the year 2040 A.D., three decades after the glassing of Earth in what has since become known as Space War One. On the colonial planet of Eden, U.N. SPACY is testing transformable variable fighters to counter further alien attacks. Two prototype aircraft piloted by former childhood friends, loose cannon Isamu and the Zentradi mixed alien race Guld, go head-to-head in aerial and robot combat superiority over a lucrative military contract, and the affections of mutual love interest Myung. “We’re excited to partner with BIGWEST to finally bring ‘MACROSS PLUS MOVIE EDITION’ to anime fans nationwide,” said Daren Miller, Fathom Events VP, Programming, Strategy & Business Affairs. “For everyone that thinks ‘Top Gun’ is exciting but would be better with Maverick and Iceman piloting robots, this one is for you.”For artwork/photos related to “MACROSS PLUS MOVIE EDITION” visit the Fathom Events press site.

Because of that, we have decided to interview directors and producers of anime studios that create works enjoyed by fans around the world and ask them about behind-the-scenes details, such as, “How do you come up with such wonderful ideas?” and, “What do you feel when you make anime?” We’ll also include photos and videos of the studio that are rarely revealed to the public.This project is being done with the cooperation of anime news sites from around the world, such as Japan’s largest anime information site Anime!Anime!, Taiwan’s massive site Bahamut, Sumikai, Honey’s Anime, and more.
