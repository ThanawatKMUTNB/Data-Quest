Platinum End Episode 24  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 25th 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of Platinum End ?                     Community score: 1.8            Y'know, in hindsight, maybe electing a suicidal 12-year-old to become God was a bad idea.    I've been struggling with how to cover this finale for a bit, because there are two distinct parts to it, but absolutely nobody gives a single, solitary shit about one of them. So I could waste everyone's time by discussing the worthless excuse for denouement this finale offers for Mirai and Saki, but what is there really left to say about that fetid carcass of a romance? Do you really need me to harp on how heatless their relationship is? Or how the show is incapable of selling any of the happiness they claim to have found with each other? Like they even give Mirai a line saying he's happiest when he sees Saki smile, then never draw either of them smiling in the entire rest of the episode – not even at their wedding!    But that's not what any of you are here for, so let's not pretend. The only thing anybody who hadn't read the manga knew going into this anime, was that the series had an infamously batshit ending. I fully believe that reputation is the only reason anyone voted for this show to continue getting episode reviews. And while this adaptation has cut a lot of the most embarrassing scenes from the manga's back-half, there was no way it could get around this one. And I'm glad it didn't. With a more conventional, happily-ever-after ending, this show would have gone down as little more than a footnote; something brought up in passing like “Hey, did ya know the Death Note guys made a crummy ripoff of The Future Diary one time?” Yet with this ending, Platinum End at last becomes the train wreck it always promised it could be.    So let's get started.    First off, is anyone here a fan of Futurama? If so, you may remember that episode where Bender gets lost in the vacuum of space and becomes host to a super tiny race of aliens who start worshiping him as a God. Predictably he screws it up and they all end up killing each other, before he happens upon the real God in the depths of space, and gets a bit of sardonic wisdom for how to play the all-knowing ruler of a planet: “You have to use a light touch, like a safe cracker or pickpocket. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.” Platinum End's creators apparently watched that episode, took its jokey non-moral on the nature of godhood at face value, and decided to construct their story's whole universe around it.    Because that's the lesson Shuji learns upon becoming God and observing the entirety of human life and suffering. He gains access to the full gestalt of life on Earth; global inequality, hunger, greed, suffering, love, faith, and all experiences in-between. And the lesson he learns from the voice of God inside his head is that this is just how it's supposed to work – God is just there to hold down the corners of human existence and not break anything until he gets bored and decides to find a successor to man the security monitors. The lark's on the wing, the snail's on the thorn, God's got his thumb up his ass, and all's right in heaven. That is a bleak, nihilist view of metaphysics – that there is an all-knowing, all-powerful being that could change the world in any number of ways, and chooses not to for no particular reason. Which isn't necessarily a complaint! You could do a lot with that, especially after an entire season of everyone arguing about the purpose of God's existence. But this is Platinum End, which means there was never a chance in hell of that happening. Instead, we get the dumbest way to accidentally create a new theology ever conceived.    Shuji, despite being an edgelord teen who read and worshiped Super Atheist Yoneda and his mad cool Facts and Logic, never ran into that old canard about omnipotence. You know the one: “If God can do anything, can God make a rock so heavy even he can't lift it?” Instead, after mulling over the entire spectrum of human experience on a cosmic scale, he comes up with “If God is real, he should kill himself to prove it.” And without a second thought just goes for it. Giving us the amazing line you see up in the review image.    Yes, that's right, God commits suicide in order to see what will happen, and wouldn't you know it, turns out he was a load-bearing pillar of all Earthly life! D'oh! Thus every single living thing on the planet vanishes from existence. In their final moments, Saki and Mirai decide that they had a pretty good run and are happy to die at the whims of the teenager they forced to become God. Yoneda, meanwhile, decides he was right all along and that God and his angels were actually an extinction-level weapon created by human imagination to achieve Armageddon. I guess even in the face of imminent non-existence, dude just has to have the last word. Then, as we zoom out from the dead husk of Earth, in one final stupid twist, it turns out both humans and God were put there by some nameless race of immortal cosmic beings, seemingly as a failed simulation to find a way to kill themselves. It's like if somebody got really drunk and tried to explain the ending to Devilman, but it took six months to tell.    And that's how Platinum End calls it a career. I could sit here and attempt to pontificate over what any of this means, of how the creators came to this as the ending, but let's all be real here. This was never planned. The implications or morals or logistics of this entire ending were never thought through. What this finale was is a desperate Hail Mary pass to get somebody, anybody to remember this story for anything besides being an unremarkable failure. And to an extent it succeeded – I'm writing about it right now, after all. So I guess I have to hand it to them.    Ultimately, that's the legacy of this story. It came in with enough of a pedigree to at least have some expectations, immediately squandered them, and proceeded to flail frantically for any sense of identity or purpose. It never found them, and so all it could hope for was that its violent death throes could make it the type of bad story people will at least dunk on across the internet, and just barely managed it through sheer desperation. After 23 episodes of throwing every stupid, bad idea they could at the wall, they finally got a turd to stick at the 11th hour. Congratulations.

What this finale was is a desperate Hail Mary pass to get somebody, anybody to remember this story for anything besides being an unremarkable failure. And to an extent it succeeded – I'm writing about it right now, after all. So I guess I have to hand it to them.    Ultimately, that's the legacy of this story. It came in with enough of a pedigree to at least have some expectations, immediately squandered them, and proceeded to flail frantically for any sense of identity or purpose. It never found them, and so all it could hope for was that its violent death throes could make it the type of bad story people will at least dunk on across the internet, and just barely managed it through sheer desperation. After 23 episodes of throwing every stupid, bad idea they could at the wall, they finally got a turd to stick at the 11th hour. Congratulations.

Platinum End Episode 24  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 25th 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of Platinum End ?                     Community score: 1.8            Y'know, in hindsight, maybe electing a suicidal 12-year-old to become God was a bad idea.    I've been struggling with how to cover this finale for a bit, because there are two distinct parts to it, but absolutely nobody gives a single, solitary shit about one of them. So I could waste everyone's time by discussing the worthless excuse for denouement this finale offers for Mirai and Saki, but what is there really left to say about that fetid carcass of a romance? Do you really need me to harp on how heatless their relationship is? Or how the show is incapable of selling any of the happiness they claim to have found with each other? Like they even give Mirai a line saying he's happiest when he sees Saki smile, then never draw either of them smiling in the entire rest of the episode – not even at their wedding!    But that's not what any of you are here for, so let's not pretend. The only thing anybody who hadn't read the manga knew going into this anime, was that the series had an infamously batshit ending. I fully believe that reputation is the only reason anyone voted for this show to continue getting episode reviews. And while this adaptation has cut a lot of the most embarrassing scenes from the manga's back-half, there was no way it could get around this one. And I'm glad it didn't. With a more conventional, happily-ever-after ending, this show would have gone down as little more than a footnote; something brought up in passing like “Hey, did ya know the Death Note guys made a crummy ripoff of The Future Diary one time?” Yet with this ending, Platinum End at last becomes the train wreck it always promised it could be.    So let's get started.    First off, is anyone here a fan of Futurama? If so, you may remember that episode where Bender gets lost in the vacuum of space and becomes host to a super tiny race of aliens who start worshiping him as a God. Predictably he screws it up and they all end up killing each other, before he happens upon the real God in the depths of space, and gets a bit of sardonic wisdom for how to play the all-knowing ruler of a planet: “You have to use a light touch, like a safe cracker or pickpocket. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.” Platinum End's creators apparently watched that episode, took its jokey non-moral on the nature of godhood at face value, and decided to construct their story's whole universe around it.    Because that's the lesson Shuji learns upon becoming God and observing the entirety of human life and suffering. He gains access to the full gestalt of life on Earth; global inequality, hunger, greed, suffering, love, faith, and all experiences in-between. And the lesson he learns from the voice of God inside his head is that this is just how it's supposed to work – God is just there to hold down the corners of human existence and not break anything until he gets bored and decides to find a successor to man the security monitors. The lark's on the wing, the snail's on the thorn, God's got his thumb up his ass, and all's right in heaven. That is a bleak, nihilist view of metaphysics – that there is an all-knowing, all-powerful being that could change the world in any number of ways, and chooses not to for no particular reason. Which isn't necessarily a complaint! You could do a lot with that, especially after an entire season of everyone arguing about the purpose of God's existence. But this is Platinum End, which means there was never a chance in hell of that happening. Instead, we get the dumbest way to accidentally create a new theology ever conceived.    Shuji, despite being an edgelord teen who read and worshiped Super Atheist Yoneda and his mad cool Facts and Logic, never ran into that old canard about omnipotence. You know the one: “If God can do anything, can God make a rock so heavy even he can't lift it?” Instead, after mulling over the entire spectrum of human experience on a cosmic scale, he comes up with “If God is real, he should kill himself to prove it.” And without a second thought just goes for it. Giving us the amazing line you see up in the review image.    Yes, that's right, God commits suicide in order to see what will happen, and wouldn't you know it, turns out he was a load-bearing pillar of all Earthly life! D'oh! Thus every single living thing on the planet vanishes from existence. In their final moments, Saki and Mirai decide that they had a pretty good run and are happy to die at the whims of the teenager they forced to become God. Yoneda, meanwhile, decides he was right all along and that God and his angels were actually an extinction-level weapon created by human imagination to achieve Armageddon. I guess even in the face of imminent non-existence, dude just has to have the last word. Then, as we zoom out from the dead husk of Earth, in one final stupid twist, it turns out both humans and God were put there by some nameless race of immortal cosmic beings, seemingly as a failed simulation to find a way to kill themselves. It's like if somebody got really drunk and tried to explain the ending to Devilman, but it took six months to tell.    And that's how Platinum End calls it a career. I could sit here and attempt to pontificate over what any of this means, of how the creators came to this as the ending, but let's all be real here. This was never planned. The implications or morals or logistics of this entire ending were never thought through. What this finale was is a desperate Hail Mary pass to get somebody, anybody to remember this story for anything besides being an unremarkable failure. And to an extent it succeeded – I'm writing about it right now, after all. So I guess I have to hand it to them.    Ultimately, that's the legacy of this story.

You know the one: “If God can do anything, can God make a rock so heavy even he can't lift it?” Instead, after mulling over the entire spectrum of human experience on a cosmic scale, he comes up with “If God is real, he should kill himself to prove it.” And without a second thought just goes for it. Giving us the amazing line you see up in the review image.    Yes, that's right, God commits suicide in order to see what will happen, and wouldn't you know it, turns out he was a load-bearing pillar of all Earthly life! D'oh! Thus every single living thing on the planet vanishes from existence. In their final moments, Saki and Mirai decide that they had a pretty good run and are happy to die at the whims of the teenager they forced to become God. Yoneda, meanwhile, decides he was right all along and that God and his angels were actually an extinction-level weapon created by human imagination to achieve Armageddon. I guess even in the face of imminent non-existence, dude just has to have the last word. Then, as we zoom out from the dead husk of Earth, in one final stupid twist, it turns out both humans and God were put there by some nameless race of immortal cosmic beings, seemingly as a failed simulation to find a way to kill themselves. It's like if somebody got really drunk and tried to explain the ending to Devilman, but it took six months to tell.    And that's how Platinum End calls it a career. I could sit here and attempt to pontificate over what any of this means, of how the creators came to this as the ending, but let's all be real here. This was never planned. The implications or morals or logistics of this entire ending were never thought through. What this finale was is a desperate Hail Mary pass to get somebody, anybody to remember this story for anything besides being an unremarkable failure. And to an extent it succeeded – I'm writing about it right now, after all. So I guess I have to hand it to them.    Ultimately, that's the legacy of this story. It came in with enough of a pedigree to at least have some expectations, immediately squandered them, and proceeded to flail frantically for any sense of identity or purpose. It never found them, and so all it could hope for was that its violent death throes could make it the type of bad story people will at least dunk on across the internet, and just barely managed it through sheer desperation. After 23 episodes of throwing every stupid, bad idea they could at the wall, they finally got a turd to stick at the 11th hour. Congratulations.      Rating:     Platinum End is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.   <prevEpisodes 1-3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episode 6 Episode 7 Episodes 8-9 Episode 10 Episode 11 Episode 12 Episode 13 Episode 14 Episode 15 Episode 16 Episode 17 Episode 18 Episode 19 Episode 20 Episode 21 Episode 22 Episode 23 Episode 24     discuss this in the forum (107 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to Platinum End Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          14 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr 10, 07:52 14 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Visit news.dexclub.com for all the latest news in Thai.                Advertising              Thank you for your interest in advertising on Anime News Network. Founded in 1998, Anime News Network is the world's leading source of up to date news and information on the anime and manga industries. Regular readers of Anime News Network not only include hundreds of thousands of anime fans, but also all of the industry heavy weights. The past several years have witnessed an attrition of English anime news sites on the Internet; as the number of sites shrink, the remaining sites only get better. Consistently growing and improving, Anime News Network is here to stay. The key benefit in advertising on Anime News Network is that our readership fits a particular demographic; mature anime fans. The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN. Provide ANN with up to $5,000 of advertising in your program guide or on site, and we will provide you an equal value on ANN.  Other Anime, manga and geek culture conventions: We provide a 50% trade with no max value. You can pay for half the value of your advertisements on ANN with advertisements in your program guide or on-site. EG: If you give us $5,000 of ads at the convention, you only have to pay us $5,000 for $10,000 worth of advertising on ANN.  For Networks We are not looking for any advertising networks at this time. Agencies and rep firms are welcome to contact us, but no networks/exchanges/rtb platforms. No Bootlegs! No Pirates! Important: Don't waste our time if you sell bootleg/pirate DVDs or host unlicensed content on your website. Not only will we not allow you to advertise with us, but we'll probably report you to the appropriate authorities, licensors and/or licensees. We do not consider gray market imports of otherwise legal goods, or doujinshi, ""bootlegs,"" although we may require potential advertisers to prove that their gray market imports are legal goods.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          14 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr 10, 07:52 14 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Founded in 1998, Anime News Network is the world's leading source of up to date news and information on the anime and manga industries. Regular readers of Anime News Network not only include hundreds of thousands of anime fans, but also all of the industry heavy weights. The past several years have witnessed an attrition of English anime news sites on the Internet; as the number of sites shrink, the remaining sites only get better. Consistently growing and improving, Anime News Network is here to stay. The key benefit in advertising on Anime News Network is that our readership fits a particular demographic; mature anime fans. The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN.

Other Anime, manga and geek culture conventions: We provide a 50% trade with no max value. You can pay for half the value of your advertisements on ANN with advertisements in your program guide or on-site.

Founded in 1998, Anime News Network is the world's leading source of up to date news and information on the anime and manga industries. Regular readers of Anime News Network not only include hundreds of thousands of anime fans, but also all of the industry heavy weights. The past several years have witnessed an attrition of English anime news sites on the Internet; as the number of sites shrink, the remaining sites only get better. Consistently growing and improving, Anime News Network is here to stay. The key benefit in advertising on Anime News Network is that our readership fits a particular demographic; mature anime fans. The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aharen-san wa Hakarenai   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (248 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          14 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr 10, 07:52 14 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aharen-san wa Hakarenai   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (248 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          14 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr 10, 07:52 14 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aharen-san wa Hakarenai   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (248 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          14 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr 10, 07:52 14 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (248 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          14 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr 10, 07:52 14 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aharen-san wa Hakarenai   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other.

While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (248 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all.

Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution.

That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (248 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review.

That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.

News Rent-A-(Really Shy!)-Girlfriend Manga Goes Back on Hiatus   posted on 2022-04-10 18:15 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Manga returned from 14-month hiatus on March 6    The latest chapter of Yuka Kinami and Reiji Miyajima's Rent-A-(Really Shy!)-Girlfriend (Kanojo, Hitomishirimasu) manga on Kodansha's Magazine Pocket app revealed on Sunday that the manga is going back on hiatus ""for a little while."" Kodansha did not reveal when the manga will return.    Miyajima and Kinami launched the manga in June 2020. The story centers on the character Sumi from the main Rent-A-Girlfriend series. The manga had resumed from a 14-month hiatus on March 6. Kodansha will publish the manga's third volume on May 17.    Kodansha Comics licensed the manga, and it describes the story:  The official spinoff manga of Rent-A-Girlfriend, the rom-com turned hit anime, features fan-favorite Sumi, the shy girl longing to come out of her shell. Written and illustrated by original creator Reiji Miyajima! Catch up on the manga before Rent-A-Girlfriend returns for a second anime season, coming soon!  Miyajima's Rent-A-Girlfriend manga launched in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine in July 2017, and it is ongoing. Kodansha Comics is publishing the manga in English.    The manga inspired a television anime that premiered in July 2020 and aired for 12 episodes. Crunchyroll streamed the anime as it aired in Japan. The show will have a second season that will premiere in July.    Miyajima launched a new manga titled Shiunji-ke no Kodomo-tachi (The Shiunji Siblings) on his Fanbox account on February 22 and in Hakusensha's Young Animal magazine on February 25.

The new cast does sound quite good in the promo, but it will still tale some time to get used to them after listening to the original cast these past 35 years since I first saw UY. I'd love to see some of the original cast making an appearance as some of the minor characters. I'd love to see Lum and Ataru's original voice actors playing Ataru's parents!

(""Daaarliiing, that's the FIFTH girl I've seen you ask for her name and LINE handle, TODAY, while WALKING TO SCHOOL!"")   …I wonder what kind of mayhem could ensue from Lum whipping up a Twitter bot. Or hacking the server for an Apex Legends knockoff. (Possibly one published by the Mendo Conglomerate.) Or what excuse Ataru might come up with for needing another hard drive after he's filled his up with porn.

The new cast does sound quite good in the promo, but it will still tale some time to get used to them after listening to the original cast these past 35 years since I first saw UY. I'd love to see some of the original cast making an appearance as some of the minor characters. I'd love to see Lum and Ataru's original voice actors playing Ataru's parents!

I'd love to see some of the original cast making an appearance as some of the minor characters. I'd love to see Lum and Ataru's original voice actors playing Ataru's parents!

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken."" Another literally c...                    game review          7 comments       Danganronpa Decadence   Nov 30, 02:00 7 comments                 games    Danganronpa Decadence offers a bit of new content, gameplay, and interactions between cast members, but this little something extra hardly feels decadent. ― Over ten years ago, the first Danganronpa game came out on the PlayStation Portable. Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork. Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally. Additionally, many ...                    game review          9 comments       Death end re;Quest   Jul  6, 03:00 9 comments                 games    Death end proves me dead wrong: it demonstrates not only Idea Factory's ability to put out quality titles, but that they can also be trusted to take real creative risks and create unique games – something all too rare in today's market. ― I wasn't expecting much from Death end re;Quest when I first picked it up. It's a product of Compile Heart, which is itself a subsidiary of Idea Factory – a studio ...                    game review          5 comments       No More Heroes 1 & 2   Jun 30, 00:00 5 comments                 games    The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games. ― The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games.

James Beckett finds out if this revamped game is worth a look for S;G fans. ― Despite its foibles, I still consider the Steins;Gate anime to be a solid science-fiction romp, and I've long meant to double back and play the original 2009 visual novel on whic...                    game review          20 comments       Kingdom Hearts III   2019 Feb  7, 03:00 20 comments                 games    Sora's long journey with his many Disney friends comes to a close in this long-awaited final chapter of the trilogy.

Or how you felt about each entry. Zipping around Disney, Pixar and original Kingdom Hearts worl...                    game review          13 comments       Tales of Vesperia Definitive Edition   2019 Feb  6, 04:07 13 comments                 games    One of the most beloved Tales RPGs is finally available in HD on the Nintendo Switch. Dave Riley finds out how this classic has held up over ten years later. ― It took ten years, and one legendarily dismissive tweet, but we finally got it. Originally released on Xbox as part of Microsoft's push for a Japanese audience, Tales of Vesperia's updated and expanded PS3 version was a Japan-only release, bar...                    game review          14 comments       REVIEW: Super Smash Bros.

Branden Johnson finds out if this edition really lives up to all the hype. ― The level of excitement in the Smash Bros. fan community has probably never been higher. For all intents and purposes, this is the game. The one that has everything we could possibly want (okay, except for Waluigi)....                    game review          26 comments       Pokémon: Let's Go!   2018 Nov 21, 02:15 26 comments                 games    Pokémon fans can explore the Kanto region like never before in this high-def remake of the classic Yellow Version, but has Generation 1 aged gracefully? Branden Johnson finds out. ― I missed the Pokemon train entirely the first time around. It's strange; I love JRPGs, and I was the perfect age when Pokemon Red and Blue hit the Gameboy in the 90s. Whatever the reasons, I haven't played a single Pokemo...                    game review          2 comments       SNK 40th Anniversary Collection   2018 Nov 16, 02:22 2 comments                 games    SNK delivers a history lesson with an anthology of early arcade and NES titles. Todd finds out how well these games have held up in this new game for the Switch. ― What made SNK a cult favorite game company? Was it the Neo Geo, which delivered arcade-perfect games at home for just two hundred dollars per cartridge? Was it the Neo Geo Pocket Color, a well-made and vastly underappreciated handheld syst...                    game review          7 comments       My Hero: One's Justice (PlayStation 4)   2018 Oct 24, 23:43 7 comments                 games    My Hero One’s Justice captures the essence of its source material, and offers a fine experience for anyone looking to cross blows as their My Hero Academia favorites. ― The anime franchise tie-in brawler is a venerable gaming institution, with Bandai Namco having published similar efforts for franchises like Naruto and Dragon Ball in the past. On the other hand, One's Justice developer Byking are rel...                    game review          2 comments       Fist of the North Star: Paradise Lost   2018 Oct 12, 00:00 2 comments                 games    The classic head-exploding action of Fist of the North Star is poured into the Yakuza gameplay mold, but do these two great tastes taste great together? Daryl Surat scours the wasteland to find out. ― The last few years have marked a surge in popularity among English-language fans of both Sega's long-running Yakuza series of videogames as well as—to a lesser extent—the formative trope-establishing Sh...                    game review          7 comments       Mega Man 11   2018 Oct  2, 23:36 7 comments                 anime    It's Mega Man's big chance for a comeback, and it's not what some fans might expect. We dig into a video-game icon's return! ― Don't let the number fool you. This may be the eleventh or twelfth central Mega Man title. It may be backed by several spin-off series. Yet it's been nearly a decade since the last full-blown game in the series. Even then, Mega Man 9 and 10 were deliberate throwbacks, built t...                    game review          4 comments       Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle   2018 Sep 24, 23:00 4 comments                 games    Capcom resurrects a bunch of their classic arcade brawlers with a seven-game collection. Do they still put up a fight? ― Brawlers. Beat 'Em Ups. Belt-Scrollers. Double Dragon Clones. Punk Punching Parades. Those Arcade Games That Mom And Dad Always Said Were Too Violent For You Back in 1988. Whatever you call them, they never quite got their moment on top. True, they were staples of arcades in the la...                    game review          7 comments       Import Review: My Hero One's Justice   2018 Sep 18, 23:00 7 comments                 games    My Hero Academia arrives on consoles and PC as a fully-featured arena brawler bursting with everyone's favorite heroes, but does it go PLUS ULTRA?

Branden Johnson gets lost in the world of Monster Hunter. ― I've long aspired to be the sort of person who is into Monster Hunter. It's a real “gamer” series: brutal difficulty, complex systems, a strong community. Being a fan of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, I figured I would get into Monster Hunter, if I could...                    game review          9 comments       Review: Fate/Grand Order Arcade   2018 Aug 22, 01:14 9 comments                 games    The smash hit Fate smartphone game gets an extra-fancy new arcade edition in Japan that actually prints out physical cards for you to take home - but it doesn't come cheap! Richard Eisenbeis took the plunge, here's his report. ―  The Fate franchise is massive and sprawling. There are numerous games, TV anime, movies, novels, drama CDs, and manga. But while the franchise originally became popular duri...                    game review          2 comments       Persona 3: Dancing Moon Night & Persona 5: Dancing Star Night   2018 Aug  8, 22:00 2 comments                 games    In the wake of Persona 4's successful rhythm game, its siblings are getting in on the action!

Richard Eisenbeis delivers his full review of the newest entry in this TRPG saga. ― The Valkyria Chronicles series is a piece of historical fiction set in a world much like our own.

Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online. Not that it was bad, just that it felt lacking compared to the two storylines that preceded it. So my expectations going into Sword Art Online: Fa...                    game review          6 comments       Ni no Kuni II:Revenant Kingdom   2018 Mar 21, 22:45 6 comments                 games    It took 8 years for a Ni no Kuni sequel to finally surface, and now that it's here, there's both good news and bad for this lavish Studio Ghibli-esque action RPG. ― Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch was a bit too traditional for me. As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase? Heidi Kemps has the answers. ― Omega Force's record with anime and manga adaptations is a bit spotty. We've had disappointments like Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage and Berserk and the Band of the Hawk, but we've also had some real win...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Dragon Ball FighterZ   2018 Jan 29, 23:00 3 comments                 games    Dustin Bailey has the full rundown on the most hotly anticipated DBZ fighting game of all time.

Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up?

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken."" Another literally c...                    game review          7 comments       Danganronpa Decadence   Nov 30, 02:00 7 comments                 games    Danganronpa Decadence offers a bit of new content, gameplay, and interactions between cast members, but this little something extra hardly feels decadent. ― Over ten years ago, the first Danganronpa game came out on the PlayStation Portable. Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork. Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally. Additionally, many ...                    game review          9 comments       Death end re;Quest   Jul  6, 03:00 9 comments                 games    Death end proves me dead wrong: it demonstrates not only Idea Factory's ability to put out quality titles, but that they can also be trusted to take real creative risks and create unique games – something all too rare in today's market. ― I wasn't expecting much from Death end re;Quest when I first picked it up. It's a product of Compile Heart, which is itself a subsidiary of Idea Factory – a studio ...                    game review          5 comments       No More Heroes 1 & 2   Jun 30, 00:00 5 comments                 games    The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games. ― The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games.

Grant Jones revisits the franchise to see if the games still hold up to their legacy. ― The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is hard to talk about in isolation. In many ways, you need a dramatic, long-winded cut scene to get the context for the release. So if you'll indulge me, I'll try to spin the tale as bes...                    game review          15 comments       Capcom Arcade Stadium   Jun  7, 00:00 15 comments                 games    Video game archives and collections of this nature are all about making sure these newer generations of gamers get a chance to experience those which laid the groundwork for the stuff that we have today in an easy-to-digest package. ― Judging collections like this is always a bit tricky because we're not reviewing a brand new game made specifically for the current generation; rather, we're technicall...                    game review          1 comment       Famicom Detective Club: The Two-Case Collection   Jun  5, 00:00 1 comment                 games    Both stories have some arbitrary info blocks like this, but even with my sus sense tingling, neither case went exactly where I expected it to go. ― This visual novel double-pack was released for English-speaking audiences for the first time on May 14, offering a shiny remake of Satoru Okada and Yoshio Sakamoto's adventure games for Nintendo.

It's a modern-day port of an older Shin Megami Tensei game that was still experimenting with 3D movement and presentation (those have mostly stuck to the Persona games while later SMTs went back to ...                    game review          4 comments       Resident Evil Village   May 19, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It has been three years since the events of the last game and our favorite, perfectly normal everyman Ethan Winters is trying to live a normal life with his wife and newly born daughter Rose.

If you've played many of the Yakuza titles and are interested in seeing how it all comes together, I can't recommend this game enough. ― Most Japanese RPGs are wildly fantastical and cartoonish in their setting, but attempt to stay grounded through relatable character writing and conflict.

An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase? Heidi Kemps has the answers. ― Omega Force's record with anime and manga adaptations is a bit spotty. We've had disappointments like Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage and Berserk and the Band of the Hawk, but we've also had some real win...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Dragon Ball FighterZ   2018 Jan 29, 23:00 3 comments                 games    Dustin Bailey has the full rundown on the most hotly anticipated DBZ fighting game of all time. Find out if FighterZ lives up to all the hype! ― Dragon Ball FighterZ isn't just a good game for fans of Dragon Ball—it's a great game period, a best-in-class fighter that looks great and is fun to play at any level. That it's crafted with loving reverence to one of the most popular anime on the planet is ...                    game review          4 comments       River City: Rival Showdown   2017 Dec 20, 23:03 4 comments                 games    The open-world gameplay of this breezy beat-em-up returns on the Nintendo 3DS. Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up? Dave Riley finds out. ― With the release of a new console, the Switch, comes the expected glut of HD ports, and Resident Evil Revelations, which has been ported to on average a console and a half per year since its original release on the 3DS in 2012, is...                    game review          10 comments       Etrian Odyssey V: Beyond the Myth   2017 Oct 21, 22:00 10 comments                 games    Does the newest entry in this difficult RPG series still hurt good enough to be worth the challenge? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

Dustin Bailey gets into it. ― The new story mode in Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite has all the characters trapped in a pair of worlds awkwardly smashed together out of pieces from their respective universes. Marvel's AIM laboratories host not only MODOK, but also the BOWs of Resident Evil, smu...

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken."" Another literally c...                    game review          7 comments       Danganronpa Decadence   Nov 30, 02:00 7 comments                 games    Danganronpa Decadence offers a bit of new content, gameplay, and interactions between cast members, but this little something extra hardly feels decadent. ― Over ten years ago, the first Danganronpa game came out on the PlayStation Portable. Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay.

Sam Leach finds out if the result is fun enough to be worth a look for casual or experienced players. ― I'm hesitant to use the word “ambitious” to describe One Piece: World Seeker, because if we're comparing it to anything beyond licensed anime games, it looks like a half-baked cookie-cutter rendition of a...                    game review          1 comment       Fate/Extella Link (Switch)   2019 Mar 24, 02:00 1 comment                 games    The sequel to the Dynasty Warriors-style Fate game Fate/Extella is here, loaded with new characters and costumes - but is it a step up from the last one, or just more of the same? ― Fate/Extella Link is set in the same general continuity as the past games in the Fate/Extra series--Fate/Extra, Fate/Extra CCC, and Fate Extella.

We dig into a video-game icon's return! ― Don't let the number fool you. This may be the eleventh or twelfth central Mega Man title. It may be backed by several spin-off series. Yet it's been nearly a decade since the last full-blown game in the series.

Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky.

Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story.

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school.

Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken."" Another literally c...                    game review          7 comments       Danganronpa Decadence   Nov 30, 02:00 7 comments                 games    Danganronpa Decadence offers a bit of new content, gameplay, and interactions between cast members, but this little something extra hardly feels decadent. ― Over ten years ago, the first Danganronpa game came out on the PlayStation Portable. Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork. Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally. Additionally, many ...                    game review          9 comments       Death end re;Quest   Jul  6, 03:00 9 comments                 games    Death end proves me dead wrong: it demonstrates not only Idea Factory's ability to put out quality titles, but that they can also be trusted to take real creative risks and create unique games – something all too rare in today's market. ― I wasn't expecting much from Death end re;Quest when I first picked it up. It's a product of Compile Heart, which is itself a subsidiary of Idea Factory – a studio ...                    game review          5 comments       No More Heroes 1 & 2   Jun 30, 00:00 5 comments                 games    The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games. ― The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games.

Grant Jones revisits the franchise to see if the games still hold up to their legacy. ― The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is hard to talk about in isolation. In many ways, you need a dramatic, long-winded cut scene to get the context for the release. So if you'll indulge me, I'll try to spin the tale as bes...                    game review          15 comments       Capcom Arcade Stadium   Jun  7, 00:00 15 comments                 games    Video game archives and collections of this nature are all about making sure these newer generations of gamers get a chance to experience those which laid the groundwork for the stuff that we have today in an easy-to-digest package. ― Judging collections like this is always a bit tricky because we're not reviewing a brand new game made specifically for the current generation; rather, we're technicall...                    game review          1 comment       Famicom Detective Club: The Two-Case Collection   Jun  5, 00:00 1 comment                 games    Both stories have some arbitrary info blocks like this, but even with my sus sense tingling, neither case went exactly where I expected it to go. ― This visual novel double-pack was released for English-speaking audiences for the first time on May 14, offering a shiny remake of Satoru Okada and Yoshio Sakamoto's adventure games for Nintendo.

It's a modern-day port of an older Shin Megami Tensei game that was still experimenting with 3D movement and presentation (those have mostly stuck to the Persona games while later SMTs went back to ...                    game review          4 comments       Resident Evil Village   May 19, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It has been three years since the events of the last game and our favorite, perfectly normal everyman Ethan Winters is trying to live a normal life with his wife and newly born daughter Rose.

This is a game that throws you head-first into the depths of its myriad gameplay systems with only a half-inflated life vest while telling you that you need to learn to swim right now. ― SaGa Frontier is a game whose original release could best be described as unfortunate.

If you've played many of the Yakuza titles and are interested in seeing how it all comes together, I can't recommend this game enough. ― Most Japanese RPGs are wildly fantastical and cartoonish in their setting, but attempt to stay grounded through relatable character writing and conflict.

Despite its missteps, this game managed to capture a spark of inspiration that kept me interested the entire time. ― Atelier Ryza 2 is somehow both one of the most belligerently boring and uniquely compelling games that I have ever played. The plot is dull and heavy-handed.

We've had disappointments like Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage and Berserk and the Band of the Hawk, but we've also had some real win...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Dragon Ball FighterZ   2018 Jan 29, 23:00 3 comments                 games    Dustin Bailey has the full rundown on the most hotly anticipated DBZ fighting game of all time. Find out if FighterZ lives up to all the hype! ― Dragon Ball FighterZ isn't just a good game for fans of Dragon Ball—it's a great game period, a best-in-class fighter that looks great and is fun to play at any level. That it's crafted with loving reverence to one of the most popular anime on the planet is ...                    game review          4 comments       River City: Rival Showdown   2017 Dec 20, 23:03 4 comments                 games    The open-world gameplay of this breezy beat-em-up returns on the Nintendo 3DS. Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up?

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat.

Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken.""

Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club.

In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork. Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally.

Grant Jones revisits the franchise to see if the games still hold up to their legacy. ― The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is hard to talk about in isolation.

Branden Johnson gets lost in the world of Monster Hunter. ― I've long aspired to be the sort of person who is into Monster Hunter. It's a real “gamer” series: brutal difficulty, complex systems, a strong community. Being a fan of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, I figured I would get into Monster Hunter, if I could...                    game review          9 comments       Review: Fate/Grand Order Arcade   2018 Aug 22, 01:14 9 comments                 games    The smash hit Fate smartphone game gets an extra-fancy new arcade edition in Japan that actually prints out physical cards for you to take home - but it doesn't come cheap! Richard Eisenbeis took the plunge, here's his report. ―  The Fate franchise is massive and sprawling. There are numerous games, TV anime, movies, novels, drama CDs, and manga. But while the franchise originally became popular duri...                    game review          2 comments       Persona 3: Dancing Moon Night & Persona 5: Dancing Star Night   2018 Aug  8, 22:00 2 comments                 games    In the wake of Persona 4's successful rhythm game, its siblings are getting in on the action!

Richard Eisenbeis delivers his full review of the newest entry in this TRPG saga. ― The Valkyria Chronicles series is a piece of historical fiction set in a world much like our own.

Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story.

As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase?

Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up?

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium.

Branden Johnson finds out if this edition really lives up to all the hype. ― The level of excitement in the Smash Bros. fan community has probably never been higher. For all intents and purposes, this is the game. The one that has everything we could possibly want (okay, except for Waluigi)....                    game review          26 comments       Pokémon: Let's Go!   2018 Nov 21, 02:15 26 comments                 games    Pokémon fans can explore the Kanto region like never before in this high-def remake of the classic Yellow Version, but has Generation 1 aged gracefully? Branden Johnson finds out. ― I missed the Pokemon train entirely the first time around. It's strange; I love JRPGs, and I was the perfect age when Pokemon Red and Blue hit the Gameboy in the 90s. Whatever the reasons, I haven't played a single Pokemo...                    game review          2 comments       SNK 40th Anniversary Collection   2018 Nov 16, 02:22 2 comments                 games    SNK delivers a history lesson with an anthology of early arcade and NES titles.

We dig into a video-game icon's return! ― Don't let the number fool you. This may be the eleventh or twelfth central Mega Man title. It may be backed by several spin-off series. Yet it's been nearly a decade since the last full-blown game in the series. Even then, Mega Man 9 and 10 were deliberate throwbacks, built t...                    game review          4 comments       Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle   2018 Sep 24, 23:00 4 comments                 games    Capcom resurrects a bunch of their classic arcade brawlers with a seven-game collection.

Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story.

As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase?

Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up?

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs).

It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium.

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   Fushihara is a woman who is a ""slave"" to her company. She meets Yūrei, the ghost girl who wants to help her.    Shachiku-san wa Yо̄jo Yuurei ni Iyasaretai. is based on Imari Arita's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                So, here's the question of the day for you all. Does this episode—and perhaps the entire anime—count as a dead baby joke? Because I've been wondering that since the moment I started watching.    This episode is built around the joke that working at your average Japanese company is more terrifying than ghosts. Shachiku is a hard worker and is thus exploited by her lazy boss who forces her to do all the work he can't be bothered with. This results in late nights working all alone. And even when faced with a supernatural being coming to kill her, she simply works on. Or to put it another way, it's only a matter of time until she wakes up reincarnated in another world.    Enter our innocent baby ghost. She doesn't want Shachiku to die and is hoping to find a way to help her. Of course, the best help would be forcing Shachiku to go home and sleep, but when that fails, our little ghost turns to massages, tea breaks, and loving hugs to help the overworked woman power through. It's all very cute—but that's not enough to keep the episode interesting.    This is made worse by how the episode is directed. We see the same scenes (lunch time and Shachiku's first encounter with the ghost) several times. Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.    In the end, this show lives or dies on how much you enjoy the cuteness overload of the baby ghost. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be just fine watching it. If you need more than cuteness in your anime, however, you might want to pass on this one.      Caitlin Moore  Rating:                If I were to describe Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost in a single word, it would be “cloying.” If reviews have to be more than one word, I would calling it cloying, mawkish, saccharine, treacly, twee, sickly sweet, maudlin, insipid, and akin to chugging a gallon bottle of liquid sucralose. It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame. You notice how I'm only comparing it to artificial sweeteners? That's because there's not a single real thing about this.    In case you're new here, hi, I'm Caitlin and I work in early childhood education with children from the ages of six months to three years. I have an extremely limited tolerance for fictional children that don't act even remotely like real children, and I gotta say, the baby ghost resembles a real toddler about as much as a maltipoo resembles a wolf. She exists to be cute and emotionally support Fushihara as she works late into the night upon the orders of her asshole boss, and really nothing else. Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.    Don't watch Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost if you like kids. Stay away if you have even the slightest concept of what makes young children funny and weird and infuriating and a joy to spend time with. Skip it if you see children for what they are, as small humans learning about the ways the world works and also happen to act like tiny drunk adults most of the time.      James Beckett  Rating:                Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is one of those anime that we seem to get one or two of every season that forces me to ask one very simple question: “Why the hell wasn't this thing a short?” Within just the first couple of minutes, I was already worried that I wouldn't jive with this comedy's particular focus on overbearing cutesy-poo fluff, but when I saw that the episode was a full half-hour, my heart sank. And I hadn't even gotten to the second half of the premiere yet.    The main issue with Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is that it isn't funny. At all. It doesn't even really have proper jokes, outside of the recurring bit where the titular ghost implores the titular Miss Shachiku to go home and sleep, rather than be worked to death, and Fushihara refuses because she wants to gush over how cute the ghost is. That's it. That's the whole premise. Every other potential joke is ruined by the episode's horrid pacing. There's certainly comedy to be mined from satirizing Japan's hostile workplace culture, dark as it may be, but Miss Shachiku seems content to have the little ghost make a bunch of baby noises for an interminably long time while its overworked protagonist gleefully rides the Overtime Monorail into an early grave.    Also—and this may be my leftover hangover from Heroines Run the School talking—we need to have a conversation about these shows that try to get away with forcing their voice actresses to make the most insufferable toddler sounds imaginable for thirty minutes straight and passing it off as comedy. I'm not going to pretend that I was jazzed about the core concept of the baby ghost to begin with, since I was turned off from the moment that I realized that the subtitles were going to have her say things like “Pwease” for the whole show. Outside of the ghost's voice and mannerisms, though, there was nothing outright offensive or unbearable about Miss Shachiku. It was mostly just slow and unfunny, which I could tolerate for a few minutes.    Then the second half of the episode kicked in, in which we see the events of the first half of the episode from the ghost's perspective, and all of it was so utterly pointless and unnecessary that I actually started getting mad. Did we need to really need to watch the ghost putter about and talk to herself about things that we already saw her say and do in the previous half? The gag of the ghost using a little speaker to sound scary was the closest that the opening came to a decent joke; did the show really need to kill it by overexplaining where she got it and how she decided to use it? Did somebody on the production committee just want to play a cruel prank on project No.9 by forcing the staff to animate four times as much as they needed to for this thing, and then they decided to keep it all in the show to add insult to injury?    I don't know. All I know is that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost was the exact opposite of a good time, for me. There are better slice-of-life anime, better workplace comedies, and better ghost stories out there to have fun with. Don't let this one haunt your Spring Season.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I almost feel badly about giving this show such a low rating, because it's clearly trying its hardest. There's a sort of earnestness about the whole thing that ought to make it more appealing than it is, a sort of well-meaning cuteness that's clearly intended to soothe the tired soul. But there's a fine line between “soothing” and “boring,” and I'm afraid that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost crosses it with wild abandon, trying its best to be as charming as possible without actually understanding what makes something sweet.    Mostly that's because I felt a bit talked down to by the episode. Our protagonist, Fushihara, is being overworked by her boss when a baby ghost (or a ghost baby) starts telling her to leave the building. The ghost is just concerned for Fushihara's well-being, and also thinks she's paying the woman back for the “offerings” of onigiri; meanwhile we know that Fushihara and the other workers have been wondering who keeps stealing their lunches. It's almost too deliberately adorable to actually be cute, and there's a real sense that we're being hit over the head with things that we're meant to find warm and fuzzy without them being that way naturally. Things like the baby ghost laying out a futon for Fushihara and then falling asleep in it herself reek of the sort of manufactured little kid behavior that not many real kids exhibit, as if the ghost was written by someone with an academic idea of toddlers without ever having interacted with one.    Of course, it's a show about a ghost (and a nekomata, a fox, an oni, and a teeny tiny maid, if the opening theme is to be believed), so realism isn't necessarily something it needs to adhere to. But the saccharine nature of the episode is just off-putting, to say nothing of the uneven nature of the storytelling, which relies on both the baby's cuteness and hopping back and forth in time, neither of which quite work. I'm probably being too nitpicky here, but all the manufactured sweetness in the world couldn't quite hold my attention with this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Whenever we get one of these shows, I can't help but feel kind of depressed about the whole thing. They're not super common, but the past few years we seem to always get at least one of these “soothing” comedies about a criminally overworked office worker getting some supernatural assistance from a cute little spirit creature. But it's never in helping the lead character find a new job or learning to value themselves enough to not work themselves into an early grave – the spirit is always just there to offer some basic comfort and support to make the rise & grind slightly more bearable. That's a premise that just can't be very fun, especially not with a show as slow-paced and repetitive as this premiere.    Because “slow” is the word for this entire episode. Jokes come with the speed of a sleepy tortoise, extending the setup for every gag well past the breaking point, for a punchline that nearly always amounts to “aww, isn't this lil ghost girl just pwecious” and little else. And that's before we get into the back half of the episode, which is just a retelling of the previous events from said ghost girl's perspective, and adds very little besides a couple of equally dull gags. In total it feels like a premiere that was planned to be an 8-minute short, and had to suddenly scramble to fill 20 at the last minute. That belabored timing pretty much strangles any chance of comedic timing even if the jokes were conceptually hilarious.    So we're left with a show that's depressing when it means to be heartwarming, and either boring or annoying when it's meant to be funny. That's a certified death knell for any show, and especially one as slight as Little Baby Ghost. I don't think I'll ever find one of these shows endearing – something about getting a fairy sidekick to make 18-hour workdays slightly less soul annihilating just tastes like ash in my mouth – but this one is far from exemplary.     discuss this in the forum (249 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          14 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr 10, 07:52 14 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   Fushihara is a woman who is a ""slave"" to her company. She meets Yūrei, the ghost girl who wants to help her.    Shachiku-san wa Yо̄jo Yuurei ni Iyasaretai. is based on Imari Arita's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                So, here's the question of the day for you all. Does this episode—and perhaps the entire anime—count as a dead baby joke? Because I've been wondering that since the moment I started watching.    This episode is built around the joke that working at your average Japanese company is more terrifying than ghosts. Shachiku is a hard worker and is thus exploited by her lazy boss who forces her to do all the work he can't be bothered with. This results in late nights working all alone. And even when faced with a supernatural being coming to kill her, she simply works on. Or to put it another way, it's only a matter of time until she wakes up reincarnated in another world.    Enter our innocent baby ghost. She doesn't want Shachiku to die and is hoping to find a way to help her. Of course, the best help would be forcing Shachiku to go home and sleep, but when that fails, our little ghost turns to massages, tea breaks, and loving hugs to help the overworked woman power through. It's all very cute—but that's not enough to keep the episode interesting.    This is made worse by how the episode is directed. We see the same scenes (lunch time and Shachiku's first encounter with the ghost) several times. Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.    In the end, this show lives or dies on how much you enjoy the cuteness overload of the baby ghost. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be just fine watching it. If you need more than cuteness in your anime, however, you might want to pass on this one.      Caitlin Moore  Rating:                If I were to describe Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost in a single word, it would be “cloying.” If reviews have to be more than one word, I would calling it cloying, mawkish, saccharine, treacly, twee, sickly sweet, maudlin, insipid, and akin to chugging a gallon bottle of liquid sucralose. It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame. You notice how I'm only comparing it to artificial sweeteners? That's because there's not a single real thing about this.    In case you're new here, hi, I'm Caitlin and I work in early childhood education with children from the ages of six months to three years. I have an extremely limited tolerance for fictional children that don't act even remotely like real children, and I gotta say, the baby ghost resembles a real toddler about as much as a maltipoo resembles a wolf. She exists to be cute and emotionally support Fushihara as she works late into the night upon the orders of her asshole boss, and really nothing else. Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.    Don't watch Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost if you like kids. Stay away if you have even the slightest concept of what makes young children funny and weird and infuriating and a joy to spend time with. Skip it if you see children for what they are, as small humans learning about the ways the world works and also happen to act like tiny drunk adults most of the time.      James Beckett  Rating:                Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is one of those anime that we seem to get one or two of every season that forces me to ask one very simple question: “Why the hell wasn't this thing a short?” Within just the first couple of minutes, I was already worried that I wouldn't jive with this comedy's particular focus on overbearing cutesy-poo fluff, but when I saw that the episode was a full half-hour, my heart sank. And I hadn't even gotten to the second half of the premiere yet.    The main issue with Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is that it isn't funny. At all. It doesn't even really have proper jokes, outside of the recurring bit where the titular ghost implores the titular Miss Shachiku to go home and sleep, rather than be worked to death, and Fushihara refuses because she wants to gush over how cute the ghost is. That's it. That's the whole premise. Every other potential joke is ruined by the episode's horrid pacing. There's certainly comedy to be mined from satirizing Japan's hostile workplace culture, dark as it may be, but Miss Shachiku seems content to have the little ghost make a bunch of baby noises for an interminably long time while its overworked protagonist gleefully rides the Overtime Monorail into an early grave.    Also—and this may be my leftover hangover from Heroines Run the School talking—we need to have a conversation about these shows that try to get away with forcing their voice actresses to make the most insufferable toddler sounds imaginable for thirty minutes straight and passing it off as comedy. I'm not going to pretend that I was jazzed about the core concept of the baby ghost to begin with, since I was turned off from the moment that I realized that the subtitles were going to have her say things like “Pwease” for the whole show. Outside of the ghost's voice and mannerisms, though, there was nothing outright offensive or unbearable about Miss Shachiku. It was mostly just slow and unfunny, which I could tolerate for a few minutes.    Then the second half of the episode kicked in, in which we see the events of the first half of the episode from the ghost's perspective, and all of it was so utterly pointless and unnecessary that I actually started getting mad. Did we need to really need to watch the ghost putter about and talk to herself about things that we already saw her say and do in the previous half? The gag of the ghost using a little speaker to sound scary was the closest that the opening came to a decent joke; did the show really need to kill it by overexplaining where she got it and how she decided to use it? Did somebody on the production committee just want to play a cruel prank on project No.9 by forcing the staff to animate four times as much as they needed to for this thing, and then they decided to keep it all in the show to add insult to injury?    I don't know. All I know is that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost was the exact opposite of a good time, for me. There are better slice-of-life anime, better workplace comedies, and better ghost stories out there to have fun with. Don't let this one haunt your Spring Season.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I almost feel badly about giving this show such a low rating, because it's clearly trying its hardest. There's a sort of earnestness about the whole thing that ought to make it more appealing than it is, a sort of well-meaning cuteness that's clearly intended to soothe the tired soul. But there's a fine line between “soothing” and “boring,” and I'm afraid that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost crosses it with wild abandon, trying its best to be as charming as possible without actually understanding what makes something sweet.    Mostly that's because I felt a bit talked down to by the episode. Our protagonist, Fushihara, is being overworked by her boss when a baby ghost (or a ghost baby) starts telling her to leave the building. The ghost is just concerned for Fushihara's well-being, and also thinks she's paying the woman back for the “offerings” of onigiri; meanwhile we know that Fushihara and the other workers have been wondering who keeps stealing their lunches. It's almost too deliberately adorable to actually be cute, and there's a real sense that we're being hit over the head with things that we're meant to find warm and fuzzy without them being that way naturally. Things like the baby ghost laying out a futon for Fushihara and then falling asleep in it herself reek of the sort of manufactured little kid behavior that not many real kids exhibit, as if the ghost was written by someone with an academic idea of toddlers without ever having interacted with one.    Of course, it's a show about a ghost (and a nekomata, a fox, an oni, and a teeny tiny maid, if the opening theme is to be believed), so realism isn't necessarily something it needs to adhere to. But the saccharine nature of the episode is just off-putting, to say nothing of the uneven nature of the storytelling, which relies on both the baby's cuteness and hopping back and forth in time, neither of which quite work. I'm probably being too nitpicky here, but all the manufactured sweetness in the world couldn't quite hold my attention with this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Whenever we get one of these shows, I can't help but feel kind of depressed about the whole thing. They're not super common, but the past few years we seem to always get at least one of these “soothing” comedies about a criminally overworked office worker getting some supernatural assistance from a cute little spirit creature. But it's never in helping the lead character find a new job or learning to value themselves enough to not work themselves into an early grave – the spirit is always just there to offer some basic comfort and support to make the rise & grind slightly more bearable. That's a premise that just can't be very fun, especially not with a show as slow-paced and repetitive as this premiere.    Because “slow” is the word for this entire episode. Jokes come with the speed of a sleepy tortoise, extending the setup for every gag well past the breaking point, for a punchline that nearly always amounts to “aww, isn't this lil ghost girl just pwecious” and little else. And that's before we get into the back half of the episode, which is just a retelling of the previous events from said ghost girl's perspective, and adds very little besides a couple of equally dull gags. In total it feels like a premiere that was planned to be an 8-minute short, and had to suddenly scramble to fill 20 at the last minute. That belabored timing pretty much strangles any chance of comedic timing even if the jokes were conceptually hilarious.    So we're left with a show that's depressing when it means to be heartwarming, and either boring or annoying when it's meant to be funny. That's a certified death knell for any show, and especially one as slight as Little Baby Ghost. I don't think I'll ever find one of these shows endearing – something about getting a fairy sidekick to make 18-hour workdays slightly less soul annihilating just tastes like ash in my mouth – but this one is far from exemplary.     discuss this in the forum (249 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          14 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr 10, 07:52 14 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   Fushihara is a woman who is a ""slave"" to her company. She meets Yūrei, the ghost girl who wants to help her.    Shachiku-san wa Yо̄jo Yuurei ni Iyasaretai. is based on Imari Arita's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                So, here's the question of the day for you all. Does this episode—and perhaps the entire anime—count as a dead baby joke? Because I've been wondering that since the moment I started watching.    This episode is built around the joke that working at your average Japanese company is more terrifying than ghosts. Shachiku is a hard worker and is thus exploited by her lazy boss who forces her to do all the work he can't be bothered with. This results in late nights working all alone. And even when faced with a supernatural being coming to kill her, she simply works on. Or to put it another way, it's only a matter of time until she wakes up reincarnated in another world.    Enter our innocent baby ghost. She doesn't want Shachiku to die and is hoping to find a way to help her. Of course, the best help would be forcing Shachiku to go home and sleep, but when that fails, our little ghost turns to massages, tea breaks, and loving hugs to help the overworked woman power through. It's all very cute—but that's not enough to keep the episode interesting.    This is made worse by how the episode is directed. We see the same scenes (lunch time and Shachiku's first encounter with the ghost) several times. Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.    In the end, this show lives or dies on how much you enjoy the cuteness overload of the baby ghost. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be just fine watching it. If you need more than cuteness in your anime, however, you might want to pass on this one.      Caitlin Moore  Rating:                If I were to describe Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost in a single word, it would be “cloying.” If reviews have to be more than one word, I would calling it cloying, mawkish, saccharine, treacly, twee, sickly sweet, maudlin, insipid, and akin to chugging a gallon bottle of liquid sucralose. It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame. You notice how I'm only comparing it to artificial sweeteners? That's because there's not a single real thing about this.    In case you're new here, hi, I'm Caitlin and I work in early childhood education with children from the ages of six months to three years. I have an extremely limited tolerance for fictional children that don't act even remotely like real children, and I gotta say, the baby ghost resembles a real toddler about as much as a maltipoo resembles a wolf. She exists to be cute and emotionally support Fushihara as she works late into the night upon the orders of her asshole boss, and really nothing else. Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.    Don't watch Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost if you like kids. Stay away if you have even the slightest concept of what makes young children funny and weird and infuriating and a joy to spend time with. Skip it if you see children for what they are, as small humans learning about the ways the world works and also happen to act like tiny drunk adults most of the time.      James Beckett  Rating:                Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is one of those anime that we seem to get one or two of every season that forces me to ask one very simple question: “Why the hell wasn't this thing a short?” Within just the first couple of minutes, I was already worried that I wouldn't jive with this comedy's particular focus on overbearing cutesy-poo fluff, but when I saw that the episode was a full half-hour, my heart sank. And I hadn't even gotten to the second half of the premiere yet.    The main issue with Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is that it isn't funny. At all. It doesn't even really have proper jokes, outside of the recurring bit where the titular ghost implores the titular Miss Shachiku to go home and sleep, rather than be worked to death, and Fushihara refuses because she wants to gush over how cute the ghost is. That's it. That's the whole premise. Every other potential joke is ruined by the episode's horrid pacing. There's certainly comedy to be mined from satirizing Japan's hostile workplace culture, dark as it may be, but Miss Shachiku seems content to have the little ghost make a bunch of baby noises for an interminably long time while its overworked protagonist gleefully rides the Overtime Monorail into an early grave.    Also—and this may be my leftover hangover from Heroines Run the School talking—we need to have a conversation about these shows that try to get away with forcing their voice actresses to make the most insufferable toddler sounds imaginable for thirty minutes straight and passing it off as comedy. I'm not going to pretend that I was jazzed about the core concept of the baby ghost to begin with, since I was turned off from the moment that I realized that the subtitles were going to have her say things like “Pwease” for the whole show. Outside of the ghost's voice and mannerisms, though, there was nothing outright offensive or unbearable about Miss Shachiku. It was mostly just slow and unfunny, which I could tolerate for a few minutes.    Then the second half of the episode kicked in, in which we see the events of the first half of the episode from the ghost's perspective, and all of it was so utterly pointless and unnecessary that I actually started getting mad. Did we need to really need to watch the ghost putter about and talk to herself about things that we already saw her say and do in the previous half? The gag of the ghost using a little speaker to sound scary was the closest that the opening came to a decent joke; did the show really need to kill it by overexplaining where she got it and how she decided to use it? Did somebody on the production committee just want to play a cruel prank on project No.9 by forcing the staff to animate four times as much as they needed to for this thing, and then they decided to keep it all in the show to add insult to injury?    I don't know. All I know is that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost was the exact opposite of a good time, for me. There are better slice-of-life anime, better workplace comedies, and better ghost stories out there to have fun with. Don't let this one haunt your Spring Season.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I almost feel badly about giving this show such a low rating, because it's clearly trying its hardest. There's a sort of earnestness about the whole thing that ought to make it more appealing than it is, a sort of well-meaning cuteness that's clearly intended to soothe the tired soul. But there's a fine line between “soothing” and “boring,” and I'm afraid that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost crosses it with wild abandon, trying its best to be as charming as possible without actually understanding what makes something sweet.    Mostly that's because I felt a bit talked down to by the episode. Our protagonist, Fushihara, is being overworked by her boss when a baby ghost (or a ghost baby) starts telling her to leave the building. The ghost is just concerned for Fushihara's well-being, and also thinks she's paying the woman back for the “offerings” of onigiri; meanwhile we know that Fushihara and the other workers have been wondering who keeps stealing their lunches. It's almost too deliberately adorable to actually be cute, and there's a real sense that we're being hit over the head with things that we're meant to find warm and fuzzy without them being that way naturally. Things like the baby ghost laying out a futon for Fushihara and then falling asleep in it herself reek of the sort of manufactured little kid behavior that not many real kids exhibit, as if the ghost was written by someone with an academic idea of toddlers without ever having interacted with one.    Of course, it's a show about a ghost (and a nekomata, a fox, an oni, and a teeny tiny maid, if the opening theme is to be believed), so realism isn't necessarily something it needs to adhere to. But the saccharine nature of the episode is just off-putting, to say nothing of the uneven nature of the storytelling, which relies on both the baby's cuteness and hopping back and forth in time, neither of which quite work. I'm probably being too nitpicky here, but all the manufactured sweetness in the world couldn't quite hold my attention with this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Whenever we get one of these shows, I can't help but feel kind of depressed about the whole thing. They're not super common, but the past few years we seem to always get at least one of these “soothing” comedies about a criminally overworked office worker getting some supernatural assistance from a cute little spirit creature. But it's never in helping the lead character find a new job or learning to value themselves enough to not work themselves into an early grave – the spirit is always just there to offer some basic comfort and support to make the rise & grind slightly more bearable. That's a premise that just can't be very fun, especially not with a show as slow-paced and repetitive as this premiere.    Because “slow” is the word for this entire episode. Jokes come with the speed of a sleepy tortoise, extending the setup for every gag well past the breaking point, for a punchline that nearly always amounts to “aww, isn't this lil ghost girl just pwecious” and little else. And that's before we get into the back half of the episode, which is just a retelling of the previous events from said ghost girl's perspective, and adds very little besides a couple of equally dull gags. In total it feels like a premiere that was planned to be an 8-minute short, and had to suddenly scramble to fill 20 at the last minute. That belabored timing pretty much strangles any chance of comedic timing even if the jokes were conceptually hilarious.    So we're left with a show that's depressing when it means to be heartwarming, and either boring or annoying when it's meant to be funny. That's a certified death knell for any show, and especially one as slight as Little Baby Ghost. I don't think I'll ever find one of these shows endearing – something about getting a fairy sidekick to make 18-hour workdays slightly less soul annihilating just tastes like ash in my mouth – but this one is far from exemplary.     discuss this in the forum (249 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          14 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr 10, 07:52 14 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.    In the end, this show lives or dies on how much you enjoy the cuteness overload of the baby ghost. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be just fine watching it. If you need more than cuteness in your anime, however, you might want to pass on this one.      Caitlin Moore  Rating:                If I were to describe Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost in a single word, it would be “cloying.” If reviews have to be more than one word, I would calling it cloying, mawkish, saccharine, treacly, twee, sickly sweet, maudlin, insipid, and akin to chugging a gallon bottle of liquid sucralose. It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame. You notice how I'm only comparing it to artificial sweeteners? That's because there's not a single real thing about this.    In case you're new here, hi, I'm Caitlin and I work in early childhood education with children from the ages of six months to three years. I have an extremely limited tolerance for fictional children that don't act even remotely like real children, and I gotta say, the baby ghost resembles a real toddler about as much as a maltipoo resembles a wolf. She exists to be cute and emotionally support Fushihara as she works late into the night upon the orders of her asshole boss, and really nothing else. Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.    Don't watch Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost if you like kids. Stay away if you have even the slightest concept of what makes young children funny and weird and infuriating and a joy to spend time with. Skip it if you see children for what they are, as small humans learning about the ways the world works and also happen to act like tiny drunk adults most of the time.      James Beckett  Rating:                Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is one of those anime that we seem to get one or two of every season that forces me to ask one very simple question: “Why the hell wasn't this thing a short?” Within just the first couple of minutes, I was already worried that I wouldn't jive with this comedy's particular focus on overbearing cutesy-poo fluff, but when I saw that the episode was a full half-hour, my heart sank. And I hadn't even gotten to the second half of the premiere yet.    The main issue with Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is that it isn't funny. At all. It doesn't even really have proper jokes, outside of the recurring bit where the titular ghost implores the titular Miss Shachiku to go home and sleep, rather than be worked to death, and Fushihara refuses because she wants to gush over how cute the ghost is. That's it. That's the whole premise. Every other potential joke is ruined by the episode's horrid pacing. There's certainly comedy to be mined from satirizing Japan's hostile workplace culture, dark as it may be, but Miss Shachiku seems content to have the little ghost make a bunch of baby noises for an interminably long time while its overworked protagonist gleefully rides the Overtime Monorail into an early grave.    Also—and this may be my leftover hangover from Heroines Run the School talking—we need to have a conversation about these shows that try to get away with forcing their voice actresses to make the most insufferable toddler sounds imaginable for thirty minutes straight and passing it off as comedy. I'm not going to pretend that I was jazzed about the core concept of the baby ghost to begin with, since I was turned off from the moment that I realized that the subtitles were going to have her say things like “Pwease” for the whole show. Outside of the ghost's voice and mannerisms, though, there was nothing outright offensive or unbearable about Miss Shachiku. It was mostly just slow and unfunny, which I could tolerate for a few minutes.    Then the second half of the episode kicked in, in which we see the events of the first half of the episode from the ghost's perspective, and all of it was so utterly pointless and unnecessary that I actually started getting mad. Did we need to really need to watch the ghost putter about and talk to herself about things that we already saw her say and do in the previous half? The gag of the ghost using a little speaker to sound scary was the closest that the opening came to a decent joke; did the show really need to kill it by overexplaining where she got it and how she decided to use it? Did somebody on the production committee just want to play a cruel prank on project No.9 by forcing the staff to animate four times as much as they needed to for this thing, and then they decided to keep it all in the show to add insult to injury?    I don't know. All I know is that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost was the exact opposite of a good time, for me. There are better slice-of-life anime, better workplace comedies, and better ghost stories out there to have fun with. Don't let this one haunt your Spring Season.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I almost feel badly about giving this show such a low rating, because it's clearly trying its hardest. There's a sort of earnestness about the whole thing that ought to make it more appealing than it is, a sort of well-meaning cuteness that's clearly intended to soothe the tired soul. But there's a fine line between “soothing” and “boring,” and I'm afraid that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost crosses it with wild abandon, trying its best to be as charming as possible without actually understanding what makes something sweet.    Mostly that's because I felt a bit talked down to by the episode. Our protagonist, Fushihara, is being overworked by her boss when a baby ghost (or a ghost baby) starts telling her to leave the building. The ghost is just concerned for Fushihara's well-being, and also thinks she's paying the woman back for the “offerings” of onigiri; meanwhile we know that Fushihara and the other workers have been wondering who keeps stealing their lunches. It's almost too deliberately adorable to actually be cute, and there's a real sense that we're being hit over the head with things that we're meant to find warm and fuzzy without them being that way naturally. Things like the baby ghost laying out a futon for Fushihara and then falling asleep in it herself reek of the sort of manufactured little kid behavior that not many real kids exhibit, as if the ghost was written by someone with an academic idea of toddlers without ever having interacted with one.    Of course, it's a show about a ghost (and a nekomata, a fox, an oni, and a teeny tiny maid, if the opening theme is to be believed), so realism isn't necessarily something it needs to adhere to. But the saccharine nature of the episode is just off-putting, to say nothing of the uneven nature of the storytelling, which relies on both the baby's cuteness and hopping back and forth in time, neither of which quite work. I'm probably being too nitpicky here, but all the manufactured sweetness in the world couldn't quite hold my attention with this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Whenever we get one of these shows, I can't help but feel kind of depressed about the whole thing. They're not super common, but the past few years we seem to always get at least one of these “soothing” comedies about a criminally overworked office worker getting some supernatural assistance from a cute little spirit creature. But it's never in helping the lead character find a new job or learning to value themselves enough to not work themselves into an early grave – the spirit is always just there to offer some basic comfort and support to make the rise & grind slightly more bearable. That's a premise that just can't be very fun, especially not with a show as slow-paced and repetitive as this premiere.    Because “slow” is the word for this entire episode. Jokes come with the speed of a sleepy tortoise, extending the setup for every gag well past the breaking point, for a punchline that nearly always amounts to “aww, isn't this lil ghost girl just pwecious” and little else. And that's before we get into the back half of the episode, which is just a retelling of the previous events from said ghost girl's perspective, and adds very little besides a couple of equally dull gags. In total it feels like a premiere that was planned to be an 8-minute short, and had to suddenly scramble to fill 20 at the last minute. That belabored timing pretty much strangles any chance of comedic timing even if the jokes were conceptually hilarious.    So we're left with a show that's depressing when it means to be heartwarming, and either boring or annoying when it's meant to be funny. That's a certified death knell for any show, and especially one as slight as Little Baby Ghost. I don't think I'll ever find one of these shows endearing – something about getting a fairy sidekick to make 18-hour workdays slightly less soul annihilating just tastes like ash in my mouth – but this one is far from exemplary.     discuss this in the forum (249 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          14 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr 10, 07:52 14 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   Fushihara is a woman who is a ""slave"" to her company. She meets Yūrei, the ghost girl who wants to help her.    Shachiku-san wa Yо̄jo Yuurei ni Iyasaretai. is based on Imari Arita's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                So, here's the question of the day for you all. Does this episode—and perhaps the entire anime—count as a dead baby joke? Because I've been wondering that since the moment I started watching.    This episode is built around the joke that working at your average Japanese company is more terrifying than ghosts. Shachiku is a hard worker and is thus exploited by her lazy boss who forces her to do all the work he can't be bothered with. This results in late nights working all alone. And even when faced with a supernatural being coming to kill her, she simply works on. Or to put it another way, it's only a matter of time until she wakes up reincarnated in another world.    Enter our innocent baby ghost. She doesn't want Shachiku to die and is hoping to find a way to help her. Of course, the best help would be forcing Shachiku to go home and sleep, but when that fails, our little ghost turns to massages, tea breaks, and loving hugs to help the overworked woman power through. It's all very cute—but that's not enough to keep the episode interesting.    This is made worse by how the episode is directed. We see the same scenes (lunch time and Shachiku's first encounter with the ghost) several times. Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.

It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame. You notice how I'm only comparing it to artificial sweeteners? That's because there's not a single real thing about this.

Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.    Don't watch Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost if you like kids. Stay away if you have even the slightest concept of what makes young children funny and weird and infuriating and a joy to spend time with. Skip it if you see children for what they are, as small humans learning about the ways the world works and also happen to act like tiny drunk adults most of the time.      James Beckett  Rating:                Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is one of those anime that we seem to get one or two of every season that forces me to ask one very simple question: “Why the hell wasn't this thing a short?” Within just the first couple of minutes, I was already worried that I wouldn't jive with this comedy's particular focus on overbearing cutesy-poo fluff, but when I saw that the episode was a full half-hour, my heart sank. And I hadn't even gotten to the second half of the premiere yet.    The main issue with Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is that it isn't funny. At all. It doesn't even really have proper jokes, outside of the recurring bit where the titular ghost implores the titular Miss Shachiku to go home and sleep, rather than be worked to death, and Fushihara refuses because she wants to gush over how cute the ghost is. That's it. That's the whole premise. Every other potential joke is ruined by the episode's horrid pacing. There's certainly comedy to be mined from satirizing Japan's hostile workplace culture, dark as it may be, but Miss Shachiku seems content to have the little ghost make a bunch of baby noises for an interminably long time while its overworked protagonist gleefully rides the Overtime Monorail into an early grave.    Also—and this may be my leftover hangover from Heroines Run the School talking—we need to have a conversation about these shows that try to get away with forcing their voice actresses to make the most insufferable toddler sounds imaginable for thirty minutes straight and passing it off as comedy. I'm not going to pretend that I was jazzed about the core concept of the baby ghost to begin with, since I was turned off from the moment that I realized that the subtitles were going to have her say things like “Pwease” for the whole show. Outside of the ghost's voice and mannerisms, though, there was nothing outright offensive or unbearable about Miss Shachiku. It was mostly just slow and unfunny, which I could tolerate for a few minutes.    Then the second half of the episode kicked in, in which we see the events of the first half of the episode from the ghost's perspective, and all of it was so utterly pointless and unnecessary that I actually started getting mad. Did we need to really need to watch the ghost putter about and talk to herself about things that we already saw her say and do in the previous half? The gag of the ghost using a little speaker to sound scary was the closest that the opening came to a decent joke; did the show really need to kill it by overexplaining where she got it and how she decided to use it? Did somebody on the production committee just want to play a cruel prank on project No.9 by forcing the staff to animate four times as much as they needed to for this thing, and then they decided to keep it all in the show to add insult to injury?    I don't know. All I know is that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost was the exact opposite of a good time, for me. There are better slice-of-life anime, better workplace comedies, and better ghost stories out there to have fun with. Don't let this one haunt your Spring Season.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I almost feel badly about giving this show such a low rating, because it's clearly trying its hardest. There's a sort of earnestness about the whole thing that ought to make it more appealing than it is, a sort of well-meaning cuteness that's clearly intended to soothe the tired soul. But there's a fine line between “soothing” and “boring,” and I'm afraid that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost crosses it with wild abandon, trying its best to be as charming as possible without actually understanding what makes something sweet.    Mostly that's because I felt a bit talked down to by the episode. Our protagonist, Fushihara, is being overworked by her boss when a baby ghost (or a ghost baby) starts telling her to leave the building. The ghost is just concerned for Fushihara's well-being, and also thinks she's paying the woman back for the “offerings” of onigiri; meanwhile we know that Fushihara and the other workers have been wondering who keeps stealing their lunches. It's almost too deliberately adorable to actually be cute, and there's a real sense that we're being hit over the head with things that we're meant to find warm and fuzzy without them being that way naturally. Things like the baby ghost laying out a futon for Fushihara and then falling asleep in it herself reek of the sort of manufactured little kid behavior that not many real kids exhibit, as if the ghost was written by someone with an academic idea of toddlers without ever having interacted with one.    Of course, it's a show about a ghost (and a nekomata, a fox, an oni, and a teeny tiny maid, if the opening theme is to be believed), so realism isn't necessarily something it needs to adhere to. But the saccharine nature of the episode is just off-putting, to say nothing of the uneven nature of the storytelling, which relies on both the baby's cuteness and hopping back and forth in time, neither of which quite work. I'm probably being too nitpicky here, but all the manufactured sweetness in the world couldn't quite hold my attention with this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Whenever we get one of these shows, I can't help but feel kind of depressed about the whole thing. They're not super common, but the past few years we seem to always get at least one of these “soothing” comedies about a criminally overworked office worker getting some supernatural assistance from a cute little spirit creature. But it's never in helping the lead character find a new job or learning to value themselves enough to not work themselves into an early grave – the spirit is always just there to offer some basic comfort and support to make the rise & grind slightly more bearable. That's a premise that just can't be very fun, especially not with a show as slow-paced and repetitive as this premiere.    Because “slow” is the word for this entire episode. Jokes come with the speed of a sleepy tortoise, extending the setup for every gag well past the breaking point, for a punchline that nearly always amounts to “aww, isn't this lil ghost girl just pwecious” and little else. And that's before we get into the back half of the episode, which is just a retelling of the previous events from said ghost girl's perspective, and adds very little besides a couple of equally dull gags. In total it feels like a premiere that was planned to be an 8-minute short, and had to suddenly scramble to fill 20 at the last minute. That belabored timing pretty much strangles any chance of comedic timing even if the jokes were conceptually hilarious.    So we're left with a show that's depressing when it means to be heartwarming, and either boring or annoying when it's meant to be funny. That's a certified death knell for any show, and especially one as slight as Little Baby Ghost. I don't think I'll ever find one of these shows endearing – something about getting a fairy sidekick to make 18-hour workdays slightly less soul annihilating just tastes like ash in my mouth – but this one is far from exemplary.     discuss this in the forum (249 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 3.5              What is this?   Fushihara is a woman who is a ""slave"" to her company. She meets Yūrei, the ghost girl who wants to help her.    Shachiku-san wa Yо̄jo Yuurei ni Iyasaretai. is based on Imari Arita's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                So, here's the question of the day for you all. Does this episode—and perhaps the entire anime—count as a dead baby joke? Because I've been wondering that since the moment I started watching.    This episode is built around the joke that working at your average Japanese company is more terrifying than ghosts. Shachiku is a hard worker and is thus exploited by her lazy boss who forces her to do all the work he can't be bothered with. This results in late nights working all alone. And even when faced with a supernatural being coming to kill her, she simply works on. Or to put it another way, it's only a matter of time until she wakes up reincarnated in another world.    Enter our innocent baby ghost. She doesn't want Shachiku to die and is hoping to find a way to help her. Of course, the best help would be forcing Shachiku to go home and sleep, but when that fails, our little ghost turns to massages, tea breaks, and loving hugs to help the overworked woman power through. It's all very cute—but that's not enough to keep the episode interesting.    This is made worse by how the episode is directed. We see the same scenes (lunch time and Shachiku's first encounter with the ghost) several times. Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.    In the end, this show lives or dies on how much you enjoy the cuteness overload of the baby ghost. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be just fine watching it. If you need more than cuteness in your anime, however, you might want to pass on this one.      Caitlin Moore  Rating:                If I were to describe Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost in a single word, it would be “cloying.” If reviews have to be more than one word, I would calling it cloying, mawkish, saccharine, treacly, twee, sickly sweet, maudlin, insipid, and akin to chugging a gallon bottle of liquid sucralose. It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame. You notice how I'm only comparing it to artificial sweeteners? That's because there's not a single real thing about this.    In case you're new here, hi, I'm Caitlin and I work in early childhood education with children from the ages of six months to three years. I have an extremely limited tolerance for fictional children that don't act even remotely like real children, and I gotta say, the baby ghost resembles a real toddler about as much as a maltipoo resembles a wolf. She exists to be cute and emotionally support Fushihara as she works late into the night upon the orders of her asshole boss, and really nothing else. Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.

That's a premise that just can't be very fun, especially not with a show as slow-paced and repetitive as this premiere.    Because “slow” is the word for this entire episode. Jokes come with the speed of a sleepy tortoise, extending the setup for every gag well past the breaking point, for a punchline that nearly always amounts to “aww, isn't this lil ghost girl just pwecious” and little else. And that's before we get into the back half of the episode, which is just a retelling of the previous events from said ghost girl's perspective, and adds very little besides a couple of equally dull gags. In total it feels like a premiere that was planned to be an 8-minute short, and had to suddenly scramble to fill 20 at the last minute. That belabored timing pretty much strangles any chance of comedic timing even if the jokes were conceptually hilarious.    So we're left with a show that's depressing when it means to be heartwarming, and either boring or annoying when it's meant to be funny. That's a certified death knell for any show, and especially one as slight as Little Baby Ghost. I don't think I'll ever find one of these shows endearing – something about getting a fairy sidekick to make 18-hour workdays slightly less soul annihilating just tastes like ash in my mouth – but this one is far from exemplary.     discuss this in the forum (249 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 3.5              What is this?   Fushihara is a woman who is a ""slave"" to her company. She meets Yūrei, the ghost girl who wants to help her.    Shachiku-san wa Yо̄jo Yuurei ni Iyasaretai. is based on Imari Arita's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                So, here's the question of the day for you all. Does this episode—and perhaps the entire anime—count as a dead baby joke? Because I've been wondering that since the moment I started watching.    This episode is built around the joke that working at your average Japanese company is more terrifying than ghosts. Shachiku is a hard worker and is thus exploited by her lazy boss who forces her to do all the work he can't be bothered with. This results in late nights working all alone. And even when faced with a supernatural being coming to kill her, she simply works on. Or to put it another way, it's only a matter of time until she wakes up reincarnated in another world.    Enter our innocent baby ghost. She doesn't want Shachiku to die and is hoping to find a way to help her. Of course, the best help would be forcing Shachiku to go home and sleep, but when that fails, our little ghost turns to massages, tea breaks, and loving hugs to help the overworked woman power through. It's all very cute—but that's not enough to keep the episode interesting.    This is made worse by how the episode is directed. We see the same scenes (lunch time and Shachiku's first encounter with the ghost) several times. Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.    In the end, this show lives or dies on how much you enjoy the cuteness overload of the baby ghost. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be just fine watching it. If you need more than cuteness in your anime, however, you might want to pass on this one.      Caitlin Moore  Rating:                If I were to describe Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost in a single word, it would be “cloying.” If reviews have to be more than one word, I would calling it cloying, mawkish, saccharine, treacly, twee, sickly sweet, maudlin, insipid, and akin to chugging a gallon bottle of liquid sucralose. It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame. You notice how I'm only comparing it to artificial sweeteners? That's because there's not a single real thing about this.    In case you're new here, hi, I'm Caitlin and I work in early childhood education with children from the ages of six months to three years. I have an extremely limited tolerance for fictional children that don't act even remotely like real children, and I gotta say, the baby ghost resembles a real toddler about as much as a maltipoo resembles a wolf. She exists to be cute and emotionally support Fushihara as she works late into the night upon the orders of her asshole boss, and really nothing else. Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.    Don't watch Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost if you like kids. Stay away if you have even the slightest concept of what makes young children funny and weird and infuriating and a joy to spend time with. Skip it if you see children for what they are, as small humans learning about the ways the world works and also happen to act like tiny drunk adults most of the time.      James Beckett  Rating:                Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is one of those anime that we seem to get one or two of every season that forces me to ask one very simple question: “Why the hell wasn't this thing a short?” Within just the first couple of minutes, I was already worried that I wouldn't jive with this comedy's particular focus on overbearing cutesy-poo fluff, but when I saw that the episode was a full half-hour, my heart sank. And I hadn't even gotten to the second half of the premiere yet.    The main issue with Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is that it isn't funny. At all. It doesn't even really have proper jokes, outside of the recurring bit where the titular ghost implores the titular Miss Shachiku to go home and sleep, rather than be worked to death, and Fushihara refuses because she wants to gush over how cute the ghost is. That's it. That's the whole premise. Every other potential joke is ruined by the episode's horrid pacing. There's certainly comedy to be mined from satirizing Japan's hostile workplace culture, dark as it may be, but Miss Shachiku seems content to have the little ghost make a bunch of baby noises for an interminably long time while its overworked protagonist gleefully rides the Overtime Monorail into an early grave.    Also—and this may be my leftover hangover from Heroines Run the School talking—we need to have a conversation about these shows that try to get away with forcing their voice actresses to make the most insufferable toddler sounds imaginable for thirty minutes straight and passing it off as comedy. I'm not going to pretend that I was jazzed about the core concept of the baby ghost to begin with, since I was turned off from the moment that I realized that the subtitles were going to have her say things like “Pwease” for the whole show. Outside of the ghost's voice and mannerisms, though, there was nothing outright offensive or unbearable about Miss Shachiku. It was mostly just slow and unfunny, which I could tolerate for a few minutes.    Then the second half of the episode kicked in, in which we see the events of the first half of the episode from the ghost's perspective, and all of it was so utterly pointless and unnecessary that I actually started getting mad. Did we need to really need to watch the ghost putter about and talk to herself about things that we already saw her say and do in the previous half? The gag of the ghost using a little speaker to sound scary was the closest that the opening came to a decent joke; did the show really need to kill it by overexplaining where she got it and how she decided to use it? Did somebody on the production committee just want to play a cruel prank on project No.9 by forcing the staff to animate four times as much as they needed to for this thing, and then they decided to keep it all in the show to add insult to injury?    I don't know. All I know is that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost was the exact opposite of a good time, for me. There are better slice-of-life anime, better workplace comedies, and better ghost stories out there to have fun with. Don't let this one haunt your Spring Season.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I almost feel badly about giving this show such a low rating, because it's clearly trying its hardest. There's a sort of earnestness about the whole thing that ought to make it more appealing than it is, a sort of well-meaning cuteness that's clearly intended to soothe the tired soul. But there's a fine line between “soothing” and “boring,” and I'm afraid that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost crosses it with wild abandon, trying its best to be as charming as possible without actually understanding what makes something sweet.    Mostly that's because I felt a bit talked down to by the episode. Our protagonist, Fushihara, is being overworked by her boss when a baby ghost (or a ghost baby) starts telling her to leave the building. The ghost is just concerned for Fushihara's well-being, and also thinks she's paying the woman back for the “offerings” of onigiri; meanwhile we know that Fushihara and the other workers have been wondering who keeps stealing their lunches. It's almost too deliberately adorable to actually be cute, and there's a real sense that we're being hit over the head with things that we're meant to find warm and fuzzy without them being that way naturally. Things like the baby ghost laying out a futon for Fushihara and then falling asleep in it herself reek of the sort of manufactured little kid behavior that not many real kids exhibit, as if the ghost was written by someone with an academic idea of toddlers without ever having interacted with one.    Of course, it's a show about a ghost (and a nekomata, a fox, an oni, and a teeny tiny maid, if the opening theme is to be believed), so realism isn't necessarily something it needs to adhere to. But the saccharine nature of the episode is just off-putting, to say nothing of the uneven nature of the storytelling, which relies on both the baby's cuteness and hopping back and forth in time, neither of which quite work. I'm probably being too nitpicky here, but all the manufactured sweetness in the world couldn't quite hold my attention with this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Whenever we get one of these shows, I can't help but feel kind of depressed about the whole thing. They're not super common, but the past few years we seem to always get at least one of these “soothing” comedies about a criminally overworked office worker getting some supernatural assistance from a cute little spirit creature.

James Beckett  Rating:                Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is one of those anime that we seem to get one or two of every season that forces me to ask one very simple question: “Why the hell wasn't this thing a short?” Within just the first couple of minutes, I was already worried that I wouldn't jive with this comedy's particular focus on overbearing cutesy-poo fluff, but when I saw that the episode was a full half-hour, my heart sank. And I hadn't even gotten to the second half of the premiere yet.    The main issue with Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is that it isn't funny. At all. It doesn't even really have proper jokes, outside of the recurring bit where the titular ghost implores the titular Miss Shachiku to go home and sleep, rather than be worked to death, and Fushihara refuses because she wants to gush over how cute the ghost is. That's it. That's the whole premise. Every other potential joke is ruined by the episode's horrid pacing. There's certainly comedy to be mined from satirizing Japan's hostile workplace culture, dark as it may be, but Miss Shachiku seems content to have the little ghost make a bunch of baby noises for an interminably long time while its overworked protagonist gleefully rides the Overtime Monorail into an early grave.    Also—and this may be my leftover hangover from Heroines Run the School talking—we need to have a conversation about these shows that try to get away with forcing their voice actresses to make the most insufferable toddler sounds imaginable for thirty minutes straight and passing it off as comedy. I'm not going to pretend that I was jazzed about the core concept of the baby ghost to begin with, since I was turned off from the moment that I realized that the subtitles were going to have her say things like “Pwease” for the whole show. Outside of the ghost's voice and mannerisms, though, there was nothing outright offensive or unbearable about Miss Shachiku. It was mostly just slow and unfunny, which I could tolerate for a few minutes.    Then the second half of the episode kicked in, in which we see the events of the first half of the episode from the ghost's perspective, and all of it was so utterly pointless and unnecessary that I actually started getting mad. Did we need to really need to watch the ghost putter about and talk to herself about things that we already saw her say and do in the previous half? The gag of the ghost using a little speaker to sound scary was the closest that the opening came to a decent joke; did the show really need to kill it by overexplaining where she got it and how she decided to use it? Did somebody on the production committee just want to play a cruel prank on project No.9 by forcing the staff to animate four times as much as they needed to for this thing, and then they decided to keep it all in the show to add insult to injury?    I don't know. All I know is that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost was the exact opposite of a good time, for me. There are better slice-of-life anime, better workplace comedies, and better ghost stories out there to have fun with. Don't let this one haunt your Spring Season.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I almost feel badly about giving this show such a low rating, because it's clearly trying its hardest. There's a sort of earnestness about the whole thing that ought to make it more appealing than it is, a sort of well-meaning cuteness that's clearly intended to soothe the tired soul. But there's a fine line between “soothing” and “boring,” and I'm afraid that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost crosses it with wild abandon, trying its best to be as charming as possible without actually understanding what makes something sweet.    Mostly that's because I felt a bit talked down to by the episode. Our protagonist, Fushihara, is being overworked by her boss when a baby ghost (or a ghost baby) starts telling her to leave the building. The ghost is just concerned for Fushihara's well-being, and also thinks she's paying the woman back for the “offerings” of onigiri; meanwhile we know that Fushihara and the other workers have been wondering who keeps stealing their lunches. It's almost too deliberately adorable to actually be cute, and there's a real sense that we're being hit over the head with things that we're meant to find warm and fuzzy without them being that way naturally. Things like the baby ghost laying out a futon for Fushihara and then falling asleep in it herself reek of the sort of manufactured little kid behavior that not many real kids exhibit, as if the ghost was written by someone with an academic idea of toddlers without ever having interacted with one.    Of course, it's a show about a ghost (and a nekomata, a fox, an oni, and a teeny tiny maid, if the opening theme is to be believed), so realism isn't necessarily something it needs to adhere to. But the saccharine nature of the episode is just off-putting, to say nothing of the uneven nature of the storytelling, which relies on both the baby's cuteness and hopping back and forth in time, neither of which quite work. I'm probably being too nitpicky here, but all the manufactured sweetness in the world couldn't quite hold my attention with this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Whenever we get one of these shows, I can't help but feel kind of depressed about the whole thing. They're not super common, but the past few years we seem to always get at least one of these “soothing” comedies about a criminally overworked office worker getting some supernatural assistance from a cute little spirit creature. But it's never in helping the lead character find a new job or learning to value themselves enough to not work themselves into an early grave – the spirit is always just there to offer some basic comfort and support to make the rise & grind slightly more bearable. That's a premise that just can't be very fun, especially not with a show as slow-paced and repetitive as this premiere.    Because “slow” is the word for this entire episode. Jokes come with the speed of a sleepy tortoise, extending the setup for every gag well past the breaking point, for a punchline that nearly always amounts to “aww, isn't this lil ghost girl just pwecious” and little else. And that's before we get into the back half of the episode, which is just a retelling of the previous events from said ghost girl's perspective, and adds very little besides a couple of equally dull gags. In total it feels like a premiere that was planned to be an 8-minute short, and had to suddenly scramble to fill 20 at the last minute. That belabored timing pretty much strangles any chance of comedic timing even if the jokes were conceptually hilarious.    So we're left with a show that's depressing when it means to be heartwarming, and either boring or annoying when it's meant to be funny. That's a certified death knell for any show, and especially one as slight as Little Baby Ghost. I don't think I'll ever find one of these shows endearing – something about getting a fairy sidekick to make 18-hour workdays slightly less soul annihilating just tastes like ash in my mouth – but this one is far from exemplary.

10-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/miss-shachiku-and-the-little-baby-ghost/.183614,Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   Fushihara is a woman who is a ""slave"" to her company. She meets Yūrei, the ghost girl who wants to help her.    Shachiku-san wa Yо̄jo Yuurei ni Iyasaretai. is based on Imari Arita's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                So, here's the question of the day for you all. Does this episode—and perhaps the entire anime—count as a dead baby joke? Because I've been wondering that since the moment I started watching.    This episode is built around the joke that working at your average Japanese company is more terrifying than ghosts. Shachiku is a hard worker and is thus exploited by her lazy boss who forces her to do all the work he can't be bothered with. This results in late nights working all alone. And even when faced with a supernatural being coming to kill her, she simply works on. Or to put it another way, it's only a matter of time until she wakes up reincarnated in another world.    Enter our innocent baby ghost. She doesn't want Shachiku to die and is hoping to find a way to help her. Of course, the best help would be forcing Shachiku to go home and sleep, but when that fails, our little ghost turns to massages, tea breaks, and loving hugs to help the overworked woman power through. It's all very cute—but that's not enough to keep the episode interesting.    This is made worse by how the episode is directed. We see the same scenes (lunch time and Shachiku's first encounter with the ghost) several times. Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.    In the end, this show lives or dies on how much you enjoy the cuteness overload of the baby ghost. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be just fine watching it. If you need more than cuteness in your anime, however, you might want to pass on this one.      Caitlin Moore  Rating:                If I were to describe Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost in a single word, it would be “cloying.” If reviews have to be more than one word, I would calling it cloying, mawkish, saccharine, treacly, twee, sickly sweet, maudlin, insipid, and akin to chugging a gallon bottle of liquid sucralose. It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame. You notice how I'm only comparing it to artificial sweeteners? That's because there's not a single real thing about this.    In case you're new here, hi, I'm Caitlin and I work in early childhood education with children from the ages of six months to three years. I have an extremely limited tolerance for fictional children that don't act even remotely like real children, and I gotta say, the baby ghost resembles a real toddler about as much as a maltipoo resembles a wolf. She exists to be cute and emotionally support Fushihara as she works late into the night upon the orders of her asshole boss, and really nothing else. Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.    Don't watch Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost if you like kids. Stay away if you have even the slightest concept of what makes young children funny and weird and infuriating and a joy to spend time with. Skip it if you see children for what they are, as small humans learning about the ways the world works and also happen to act like tiny drunk adults most of the time.      James Beckett  Rating:                Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is one of those anime that we seem to get one or two of every season that forces me to ask one very simple question: “Why the hell wasn't this thing a short?” Within just the first couple of minutes, I was already worried that I wouldn't jive with this comedy's particular focus on overbearing cutesy-poo fluff, but when I saw that the episode was a full half-hour, my heart sank.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Spy×Family   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7              What is this?   Agent Twilight, the greatest spy for the nation of Westalis, has to infiltrate an elite private school. In order to do so he assumes the identity of psychiatrist Loid Forger, adopts an orphan girl, and marries a city hall employee. Unknown to him, his daughter Anya is a telepath and his wife Yor is an assassin. The three learn to become a family while working to complete Twilight's missions and maintain world peace. (from manga)   Spy×Family is based on Tatsuya Endō's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitin Moore  Rating:                As this season's Jump+ entry, SPY x FAMILY is easily the most anticipated series out of the three dozen or so series that have premiered over the last couple of weeks. And for once, I'm right here along with everyone else who was anticipating the heck out of it. That's because unlike most of the magazine's series that get turned into anime megahits, SPY x FAMILY's focus isn't primarily on fanservice, but on some of the most consistently funny, wholesome comedy in manga today.    I'm aware that as an American adult woman, I am well outside of SPY x FAMILY's target demographic, so please understand that I'm being tongue-in-cheek when I say this but: this series was made for me. Loid Forger is stunningly attractive both dressed up and dressed down, and doing his best to be a dad to Anya, who is melting his heart despite his attempts at retaining cold professionalism. Anya's psychic powers may get her out of scrapes and let her look smarter than she really is, but that doesn't make her overly precocious or sassy. When it comes to things other than giving correct answers, it's an accurate representation of how young children try to piece together meaning out of what they overhear from adults based on their limited understanding of the world. The two play off each other beautifully, and their relationship quickly becomes heartwarming as it becomes clear that Loid needs Anya not just as a spy on a mission, but as a person who is starved for human connection.    (Oh, and Yor isn't here yet but she's hot too and that's why SPY x FAMILY is bisexual culture.)    Unfortunately, it can be difficult to review comedy in a way that isn't just reciting the best jokes while I chuckle to myself, which is terribly unfunny to read so I'll spare you that pain and just encourage you to give it a shot, even if you're already familiar with the manga. I've always liked Kazuhiro Furuhashi as a director – I'm one of those weirdos who prefers the looser 1999 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter, which Furuhashi helmed, to 2011's shot-for-shot remake of the manga – and here he serves the source material well, with a consistent sense of comic timing to perfectly deliver each joke.    If you only watch one anime this season… pick the series that sounds most interesting to you, because taste is subjective and we all have our own preferences. But if you're stymied by the selection, SPY x FAMILY is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser and a solid choice for almost everyone.       James Beckett  Rating:               Hot damn! That is how you handle an adaptation. I am woefully behind on the manga version of SPY x FAMILY, but when I read that first chapter a while back, it made a huge impression, compelling and entertaining as it was. An anime was practically inevitable, and hype for the series only grew when it was confirmed that Wit Studio would be handling the production (alongside CloverWorks, who admittedly have a spottier track record as of late). I don't think anyone was ever expecting this show to be anything less than very good, but I have good news for any of the doubters left out there: SPY x FAMILY isn't just “very good”, it's fan-freakin'-tastic.    The key to SPY x FAMILY's success is the strength of its foundations. A comedy-thriller about a stone-cold spy becoming the father figure of an impossibly cute child (who also happens to be a telepath) is just a kickass concept, no matter the medium, and author Tatsuya Endō takes advantage of every hilarious and heartwarming ounce of potential that he can squeeze from it. Twilight/“Loid” is a great protagonist for this story, because his complete detachment from his own emotions makes perfect sense given his dangerous occupation, but it also allows for some damned funny shenanigans to ensue once he gets roped into the absurdity of “Operation Strix”.    The breakout star of the show, though, is clearly going to be Anya, who is so utterly precious and delightful that SPY x FAMILY ought to be arrested for conspiracy to drive its tens of thousands of viewers into sweetness-induced comas. Other anime need to take note: This is how you write a smart and intelligent kid that still sounds and behaves like a reasonable approximation of a real human child. My favorite scenes of this premiere all came from Anya just being a little goofball despite her powers and her smarts, like when she inadvertently summons a hit squad to her new villa when she messes around with Twilight's spy gear.    Speaking of the hit squad, another thing that SPY x FAMILY has going for it are it's gorgeous production values. Wit and CloverWorks are clearly going for broke here, because some of the kickass action scenes that we get between Twilight and the bad guys are straight-up cinematic in their framing and fluidity. SPY x FAMILY is a comedy first, but it doesn't forget that a spy story damn well better have some thrills in it, if only because it makes the jokes and the drama that follow hit that much harder.    Ultimately, though, what won me over to SPY x FAMILY is its heart. This show is just so cute, you guys, and I can't handle it. When Twilight picked up Anya and told her how well she did after the entrance exams, and you see her beam with pride and love…I cried like a baby, okay? I'm an easy mark for stories like this already, and SPY x FAMILY makes it impossible to resist when it does everything it sets out to do so damned well. This show is adorable, funny, and cool as hell, and it shot straight to the top of my Must Watch List of the season, just like I knew it would.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               To call this show the most anticipated title of the season would be a bit of an understatement. The original manga is about as close as you can get to an instant mega-hit, having already broken 15 million copies in circulation before its anime has even aired. With the impossibly polished trailers and visuals released ahead of this premiere, you had a perfect recipe for hype. Thankfully, all that buildup was worth it, as SPY x FAMILY is easily the sharpest, slickest premiere of the season, and quite possibly the whole year.    Just pardon me for a moment while I gush about how good this show looks. The character designs do a beautiful job bringing the simple and expressive nature of Tatsuya Endō's art to life, while also looking perfect in motion. The storyboarding and direction are in a class of their own compared to anything else that's aired this season, channeling the thrill of a classic spy movie without ever feeling gimmicky. And the amount of expressive character animation, be it in action scenes or simple comedy bits, brings the cast to life wonderfully. Through the visuals alone, this is about as close to a dream adaptation as you can get. That's no easy task considering how wide a net the show casts in both tone and plot, bouncing between cute-as-hell family comedy and life-or-death action setpieces. But this episode manages to portray both with equal energy and impact.    Of course, looking good wouldn't salvage things if the story and characters weren't engaging, and that's where this series really shines. Twilight (now “Loid Forger”) is a perfect conduit for the mix of silly and serious spy shenanigans shown in this setting, acting the stone-faced straight man to his ludicrous mission while nonetheless taking it 1000% seriously. It makes Anya his perfect foil as she breaks through his stoic exterior, both with her telepathy and sheer dumbassery, and every moment we see them interact is hilarious, right up until things suddenly get emotional. This could very well have gotten by on just being a comedy about a spy dad failing to keep secrets from his adoptive daughter and letting hijinks ensue, but by the end of this episode you feel a genuine connection between Loid and his new daughter, even if he wouldn't admit it himself. That's the crack in his façade that really matters, and it gives a slick and confident premiere that little extra heart it needs to be outstanding.    Though that particular dichotomy is perhaps the biggest place where this premiere might lose folks. SPY x FAMILY operates in a very precarious space between a goofy comedy of coincidences and a serious spy thriller, where the result is a world that mostly runs on cartoon logic. But that balance is hard to nail down, and the introduction struggles with it the most, trying to pull genuine emotion out of a Master of Disguise-style spy and a girl who randomly has mind-reading powers. Ultimately the resolution of this episode is sweet and earnest enough to make that work, but I wouldn't blame anybody for scratching their head when the narration nonchalantly explains that Anya has superpowers. That's just how this world works, and you've got to be on board for that to get to the good stuff.    If, however, you can roll with this wacky take on the Cold War, this is a fantastic time that promises to be one of the highlights of the season. And if you're like me and already a devotee of the manga, then you can rest assured that this adaptation is in great hands so far.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Anya is a fantastic little character, isn't she? She is the heart and soul of this anime and it wouldn't work even half as well without her. The duality of her character is perfect. On one hand, she is very young—likely younger than the 6-year-old she claims to be. On the other, she is psychic and can read people's minds. The way these two halves collide is the core of both the drama and comedy of the series. Just because she can see what a person is thinking doesn't mean she is any smarter than any other girl her age. She thinks spies are like what she sees on TV and can't imagine the real danger that her new life now harbors.    Yet, despite all this, there is a legitimate connection between her and Twilight. At first, the spy has trouble connecting with the girl, simply planning to use her as cover for this latest operation and then discard her. But when he realizes that he was her as a child, abandoned and alone with no one to rely on, he knows that he can't simply abandon Anya—no matter if that is the tactically correct choice. After all, everything he's doing as a spy is to stop what happened to him from happening to others. It's great character growth, pure and simple.    But what would the characters be without a world to inhabit? Spy×Family is set in a fascinating fictional reimagining of Germany during the Cold War when the country was split in two. The technology, likewise, seems to be equivalent to that of the 60s and 70s—so we have TV and ham radios but not cell phones or laptop computers. In other words, we have a world from before the internet where the spy game was at its most personal. The aesthetic is fantastic and makes for a visually interesting world.    All in all, this is a solid premiere episode. It's got great characters and solid worldbuilding. And I am more than a little excited to see what happens when “mom” enters into the strange new family next week.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I've said in basically all of my reviews of the manga SPY x FAMILY is based on that Anya is the beating heart of the series, and I'm pleased to report that the same holds true of the anime adaptation. That was by no means a certainty – as we've seen in other shows, getting little kids right is no easy feat, and Anya could easily have come off as twee or artificial. And yes, she does have a few “what adults think kids are like” moments, but that doesn't take away from the way that she wriggles her way into Twilight's life and makes a place for her there. It's like a dad anime with a dose of Cold War spy caper thrown in for good measure.    Of course, it's technically the other way around. Twilight, our protagonist, is a spy tasked with maintaining peace between East and West Totally-Not-Germany during the mid-twentieth century. (Despite a couple of clear shots of the number “89,” it looks more like we're in the 60s than the 80s based on technology and vehicles, to say nothing of Twilight's flashback to what appears to be WWII.) His latest mission is the most dangerous and difficult yet: in order to get to his target, he needs a family. At first it looks like just a kid he can get enrolled in the target's prestigious school is enough, but by the end of the episode, it turns out that a wife will be necessary as well. Since he's clearly learning this “meaningful human interaction” thing from the ground up, this is very likely to be his toughest challenge yet.    Does that make it a good thing or a bad thing that the kid he picks out at the world's shadiest orphanage is a psychic? The jury's still out on that one when it comes to the mission, but in terms of the story, it's definitely a good thing. Anya, who is absolutely not quite six years old as she claims, is desperate for a family, and since her favorite cartoon involves spies, she's thrilled to have a new dad who is one – not that he knows that she knows. But it's also a source of insecurity for the little girl, because she can hear every single thought that goes through “Loid Forger's” head, and that plus her abandonment issues makes her a very insecure child desperately craving security. The episode doesn't shy away from that pathos, although it also doesn't dwell on it; quiet scenes like Anya snuggling under a sleeping Twilight's arm give us reassurance even as Twilight's struggle with parenthood and Anya's powers are played for laughs. It's a tough balance to strike, but the episode largely pulls it off.    There are also plenty of very good details in the backgrounds and props of the story, which give this the feeling of a grounded, fully realized world. They can be a bit on the nose, of course – one newspaper clearly shows the words “cold war” just in case you didn't get when the setting is – but mostly they just work to enhance the reality of the setting. Animation is fluid when it needs to be, such as the fight scene in Twilight's apartment, and if Anya's pink hair stands out in the otherwise realistic color scheme, that's very likely on purpose. As a fan of the source material, I'm very happy with this adaptation, and even if you haven't read the manga, this is absolutely worth checking out – especially if you're a fan of found family stories.     discuss this in the forum (249 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          14 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr 10, 07:52 14 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Spy×Family   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7              What is this?   Agent Twilight, the greatest spy for the nation of Westalis, has to infiltrate an elite private school. In order to do so he assumes the identity of psychiatrist Loid Forger, adopts an orphan girl, and marries a city hall employee. Unknown to him, his daughter Anya is a telepath and his wife Yor is an assassin. The three learn to become a family while working to complete Twilight's missions and maintain world peace. (from manga)   Spy×Family is based on Tatsuya Endō's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitin Moore  Rating:                As this season's Jump+ entry, SPY x FAMILY is easily the most anticipated series out of the three dozen or so series that have premiered over the last couple of weeks. And for once, I'm right here along with everyone else who was anticipating the heck out of it. That's because unlike most of the magazine's series that get turned into anime megahits, SPY x FAMILY's focus isn't primarily on fanservice, but on some of the most consistently funny, wholesome comedy in manga today.    I'm aware that as an American adult woman, I am well outside of SPY x FAMILY's target demographic, so please understand that I'm being tongue-in-cheek when I say this but: this series was made for me. Loid Forger is stunningly attractive both dressed up and dressed down, and doing his best to be a dad to Anya, who is melting his heart despite his attempts at retaining cold professionalism. Anya's psychic powers may get her out of scrapes and let her look smarter than she really is, but that doesn't make her overly precocious or sassy. When it comes to things other than giving correct answers, it's an accurate representation of how young children try to piece together meaning out of what they overhear from adults based on their limited understanding of the world. The two play off each other beautifully, and their relationship quickly becomes heartwarming as it becomes clear that Loid needs Anya not just as a spy on a mission, but as a person who is starved for human connection.    (Oh, and Yor isn't here yet but she's hot too and that's why SPY x FAMILY is bisexual culture.)    Unfortunately, it can be difficult to review comedy in a way that isn't just reciting the best jokes while I chuckle to myself, which is terribly unfunny to read so I'll spare you that pain and just encourage you to give it a shot, even if you're already familiar with the manga. I've always liked Kazuhiro Furuhashi as a director – I'm one of those weirdos who prefers the looser 1999 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter, which Furuhashi helmed, to 2011's shot-for-shot remake of the manga – and here he serves the source material well, with a consistent sense of comic timing to perfectly deliver each joke.    If you only watch one anime this season… pick the series that sounds most interesting to you, because taste is subjective and we all have our own preferences. But if you're stymied by the selection, SPY x FAMILY is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser and a solid choice for almost everyone.       James Beckett  Rating:               Hot damn! That is how you handle an adaptation. I am woefully behind on the manga version of SPY x FAMILY, but when I read that first chapter a while back, it made a huge impression, compelling and entertaining as it was. An anime was practically inevitable, and hype for the series only grew when it was confirmed that Wit Studio would be handling the production (alongside CloverWorks, who admittedly have a spottier track record as of late). I don't think anyone was ever expecting this show to be anything less than very good, but I have good news for any of the doubters left out there: SPY x FAMILY isn't just “very good”, it's fan-freakin'-tastic.    The key to SPY x FAMILY's success is the strength of its foundations. A comedy-thriller about a stone-cold spy becoming the father figure of an impossibly cute child (who also happens to be a telepath) is just a kickass concept, no matter the medium, and author Tatsuya Endō takes advantage of every hilarious and heartwarming ounce of potential that he can squeeze from it. Twilight/“Loid” is a great protagonist for this story, because his complete detachment from his own emotions makes perfect sense given his dangerous occupation, but it also allows for some damned funny shenanigans to ensue once he gets roped into the absurdity of “Operation Strix”.    The breakout star of the show, though, is clearly going to be Anya, who is so utterly precious and delightful that SPY x FAMILY ought to be arrested for conspiracy to drive its tens of thousands of viewers into sweetness-induced comas. Other anime need to take note: This is how you write a smart and intelligent kid that still sounds and behaves like a reasonable approximation of a real human child. My favorite scenes of this premiere all came from Anya just being a little goofball despite her powers and her smarts, like when she inadvertently summons a hit squad to her new villa when she messes around with Twilight's spy gear.    Speaking of the hit squad, another thing that SPY x FAMILY has going for it are it's gorgeous production values. Wit and CloverWorks are clearly going for broke here, because some of the kickass action scenes that we get between Twilight and the bad guys are straight-up cinematic in their framing and fluidity. SPY x FAMILY is a comedy first, but it doesn't forget that a spy story damn well better have some thrills in it, if only because it makes the jokes and the drama that follow hit that much harder.    Ultimately, though, what won me over to SPY x FAMILY is its heart. This show is just so cute, you guys, and I can't handle it. When Twilight picked up Anya and told her how well she did after the entrance exams, and you see her beam with pride and love…I cried like a baby, okay? I'm an easy mark for stories like this already, and SPY x FAMILY makes it impossible to resist when it does everything it sets out to do so damned well. This show is adorable, funny, and cool as hell, and it shot straight to the top of my Must Watch List of the season, just like I knew it would.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               To call this show the most anticipated title of the season would be a bit of an understatement. The original manga is about as close as you can get to an instant mega-hit, having already broken 15 million copies in circulation before its anime has even aired. With the impossibly polished trailers and visuals released ahead of this premiere, you had a perfect recipe for hype. Thankfully, all that buildup was worth it, as SPY x FAMILY is easily the sharpest, slickest premiere of the season, and quite possibly the whole year.    Just pardon me for a moment while I gush about how good this show looks. The character designs do a beautiful job bringing the simple and expressive nature of Tatsuya Endō's art to life, while also looking perfect in motion. The storyboarding and direction are in a class of their own compared to anything else that's aired this season, channeling the thrill of a classic spy movie without ever feeling gimmicky. And the amount of expressive character animation, be it in action scenes or simple comedy bits, brings the cast to life wonderfully. Through the visuals alone, this is about as close to a dream adaptation as you can get. That's no easy task considering how wide a net the show casts in both tone and plot, bouncing between cute-as-hell family comedy and life-or-death action setpieces. But this episode manages to portray both with equal energy and impact.    Of course, looking good wouldn't salvage things if the story and characters weren't engaging, and that's where this series really shines. Twilight (now “Loid Forger”) is a perfect conduit for the mix of silly and serious spy shenanigans shown in this setting, acting the stone-faced straight man to his ludicrous mission while nonetheless taking it 1000% seriously. It makes Anya his perfect foil as she breaks through his stoic exterior, both with her telepathy and sheer dumbassery, and every moment we see them interact is hilarious, right up until things suddenly get emotional. This could very well have gotten by on just being a comedy about a spy dad failing to keep secrets from his adoptive daughter and letting hijinks ensue, but by the end of this episode you feel a genuine connection between Loid and his new daughter, even if he wouldn't admit it himself. That's the crack in his façade that really matters, and it gives a slick and confident premiere that little extra heart it needs to be outstanding.    Though that particular dichotomy is perhaps the biggest place where this premiere might lose folks. SPY x FAMILY operates in a very precarious space between a goofy comedy of coincidences and a serious spy thriller, where the result is a world that mostly runs on cartoon logic. But that balance is hard to nail down, and the introduction struggles with it the most, trying to pull genuine emotion out of a Master of Disguise-style spy and a girl who randomly has mind-reading powers. Ultimately the resolution of this episode is sweet and earnest enough to make that work, but I wouldn't blame anybody for scratching their head when the narration nonchalantly explains that Anya has superpowers. That's just how this world works, and you've got to be on board for that to get to the good stuff.    If, however, you can roll with this wacky take on the Cold War, this is a fantastic time that promises to be one of the highlights of the season. And if you're like me and already a devotee of the manga, then you can rest assured that this adaptation is in great hands so far.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Anya is a fantastic little character, isn't she? She is the heart and soul of this anime and it wouldn't work even half as well without her. The duality of her character is perfect. On one hand, she is very young—likely younger than the 6-year-old she claims to be. On the other, she is psychic and can read people's minds. The way these two halves collide is the core of both the drama and comedy of the series. Just because she can see what a person is thinking doesn't mean she is any smarter than any other girl her age. She thinks spies are like what she sees on TV and can't imagine the real danger that her new life now harbors.    Yet, despite all this, there is a legitimate connection between her and Twilight. At first, the spy has trouble connecting with the girl, simply planning to use her as cover for this latest operation and then discard her. But when he realizes that he was her as a child, abandoned and alone with no one to rely on, he knows that he can't simply abandon Anya—no matter if that is the tactically correct choice. After all, everything he's doing as a spy is to stop what happened to him from happening to others. It's great character growth, pure and simple.    But what would the characters be without a world to inhabit? Spy×Family is set in a fascinating fictional reimagining of Germany during the Cold War when the country was split in two. The technology, likewise, seems to be equivalent to that of the 60s and 70s—so we have TV and ham radios but not cell phones or laptop computers. In other words, we have a world from before the internet where the spy game was at its most personal. The aesthetic is fantastic and makes for a visually interesting world.    All in all, this is a solid premiere episode. It's got great characters and solid worldbuilding. And I am more than a little excited to see what happens when “mom” enters into the strange new family next week.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I've said in basically all of my reviews of the manga SPY x FAMILY is based on that Anya is the beating heart of the series, and I'm pleased to report that the same holds true of the anime adaptation. That was by no means a certainty – as we've seen in other shows, getting little kids right is no easy feat, and Anya could easily have come off as twee or artificial. And yes, she does have a few “what adults think kids are like” moments, but that doesn't take away from the way that she wriggles her way into Twilight's life and makes a place for her there. It's like a dad anime with a dose of Cold War spy caper thrown in for good measure.    Of course, it's technically the other way around. Twilight, our protagonist, is a spy tasked with maintaining peace between East and West Totally-Not-Germany during the mid-twentieth century. (Despite a couple of clear shots of the number “89,” it looks more like we're in the 60s than the 80s based on technology and vehicles, to say nothing of Twilight's flashback to what appears to be WWII.) His latest mission is the most dangerous and difficult yet: in order to get to his target, he needs a family. At first it looks like just a kid he can get enrolled in the target's prestigious school is enough, but by the end of the episode, it turns out that a wife will be necessary as well. Since he's clearly learning this “meaningful human interaction” thing from the ground up, this is very likely to be his toughest challenge yet.    Does that make it a good thing or a bad thing that the kid he picks out at the world's shadiest orphanage is a psychic? The jury's still out on that one when it comes to the mission, but in terms of the story, it's definitely a good thing. Anya, who is absolutely not quite six years old as she claims, is desperate for a family, and since her favorite cartoon involves spies, she's thrilled to have a new dad who is one – not that he knows that she knows. But it's also a source of insecurity for the little girl, because she can hear every single thought that goes through “Loid Forger's” head, and that plus her abandonment issues makes her a very insecure child desperately craving security. The episode doesn't shy away from that pathos, although it also doesn't dwell on it; quiet scenes like Anya snuggling under a sleeping Twilight's arm give us reassurance even as Twilight's struggle with parenthood and Anya's powers are played for laughs. It's a tough balance to strike, but the episode largely pulls it off.    There are also plenty of very good details in the backgrounds and props of the story, which give this the feeling of a grounded, fully realized world. They can be a bit on the nose, of course – one newspaper clearly shows the words “cold war” just in case you didn't get when the setting is – but mostly they just work to enhance the reality of the setting. Animation is fluid when it needs to be, such as the fight scene in Twilight's apartment, and if Anya's pink hair stands out in the otherwise realistic color scheme, that's very likely on purpose. As a fan of the source material, I'm very happy with this adaptation, and even if you haven't read the manga, this is absolutely worth checking out – especially if you're a fan of found family stories.     discuss this in the forum (249 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          14 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr 10, 07:52 14 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Spy×Family   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7              What is this?   Agent Twilight, the greatest spy for the nation of Westalis, has to infiltrate an elite private school. In order to do so he assumes the identity of psychiatrist Loid Forger, adopts an orphan girl, and marries a city hall employee. Unknown to him, his daughter Anya is a telepath and his wife Yor is an assassin. The three learn to become a family while working to complete Twilight's missions and maintain world peace. (from manga)   Spy×Family is based on Tatsuya Endō's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitin Moore  Rating:                As this season's Jump+ entry, SPY x FAMILY is easily the most anticipated series out of the three dozen or so series that have premiered over the last couple of weeks. And for once, I'm right here along with everyone else who was anticipating the heck out of it. That's because unlike most of the magazine's series that get turned into anime megahits, SPY x FAMILY's focus isn't primarily on fanservice, but on some of the most consistently funny, wholesome comedy in manga today.    I'm aware that as an American adult woman, I am well outside of SPY x FAMILY's target demographic, so please understand that I'm being tongue-in-cheek when I say this but: this series was made for me. Loid Forger is stunningly attractive both dressed up and dressed down, and doing his best to be a dad to Anya, who is melting his heart despite his attempts at retaining cold professionalism. Anya's psychic powers may get her out of scrapes and let her look smarter than she really is, but that doesn't make her overly precocious or sassy. When it comes to things other than giving correct answers, it's an accurate representation of how young children try to piece together meaning out of what they overhear from adults based on their limited understanding of the world. The two play off each other beautifully, and their relationship quickly becomes heartwarming as it becomes clear that Loid needs Anya not just as a spy on a mission, but as a person who is starved for human connection.    (Oh, and Yor isn't here yet but she's hot too and that's why SPY x FAMILY is bisexual culture.)    Unfortunately, it can be difficult to review comedy in a way that isn't just reciting the best jokes while I chuckle to myself, which is terribly unfunny to read so I'll spare you that pain and just encourage you to give it a shot, even if you're already familiar with the manga. I've always liked Kazuhiro Furuhashi as a director – I'm one of those weirdos who prefers the looser 1999 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter, which Furuhashi helmed, to 2011's shot-for-shot remake of the manga – and here he serves the source material well, with a consistent sense of comic timing to perfectly deliver each joke.    If you only watch one anime this season… pick the series that sounds most interesting to you, because taste is subjective and we all have our own preferences. But if you're stymied by the selection, SPY x FAMILY is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser and a solid choice for almost everyone.       James Beckett  Rating:               Hot damn! That is how you handle an adaptation. I am woefully behind on the manga version of SPY x FAMILY, but when I read that first chapter a while back, it made a huge impression, compelling and entertaining as it was. An anime was practically inevitable, and hype for the series only grew when it was confirmed that Wit Studio would be handling the production (alongside CloverWorks, who admittedly have a spottier track record as of late). I don't think anyone was ever expecting this show to be anything less than very good, but I have good news for any of the doubters left out there: SPY x FAMILY isn't just “very good”, it's fan-freakin'-tastic.    The key to SPY x FAMILY's success is the strength of its foundations. A comedy-thriller about a stone-cold spy becoming the father figure of an impossibly cute child (who also happens to be a telepath) is just a kickass concept, no matter the medium, and author Tatsuya Endō takes advantage of every hilarious and heartwarming ounce of potential that he can squeeze from it. Twilight/“Loid” is a great protagonist for this story, because his complete detachment from his own emotions makes perfect sense given his dangerous occupation, but it also allows for some damned funny shenanigans to ensue once he gets roped into the absurdity of “Operation Strix”.    The breakout star of the show, though, is clearly going to be Anya, who is so utterly precious and delightful that SPY x FAMILY ought to be arrested for conspiracy to drive its tens of thousands of viewers into sweetness-induced comas. Other anime need to take note: This is how you write a smart and intelligent kid that still sounds and behaves like a reasonable approximation of a real human child. My favorite scenes of this premiere all came from Anya just being a little goofball despite her powers and her smarts, like when she inadvertently summons a hit squad to her new villa when she messes around with Twilight's spy gear.    Speaking of the hit squad, another thing that SPY x FAMILY has going for it are it's gorgeous production values. Wit and CloverWorks are clearly going for broke here, because some of the kickass action scenes that we get between Twilight and the bad guys are straight-up cinematic in their framing and fluidity. SPY x FAMILY is a comedy first, but it doesn't forget that a spy story damn well better have some thrills in it, if only because it makes the jokes and the drama that follow hit that much harder.    Ultimately, though, what won me over to SPY x FAMILY is its heart. This show is just so cute, you guys, and I can't handle it. When Twilight picked up Anya and told her how well she did after the entrance exams, and you see her beam with pride and love…I cried like a baby, okay? I'm an easy mark for stories like this already, and SPY x FAMILY makes it impossible to resist when it does everything it sets out to do so damned well. This show is adorable, funny, and cool as hell, and it shot straight to the top of my Must Watch List of the season, just like I knew it would.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               To call this show the most anticipated title of the season would be a bit of an understatement. The original manga is about as close as you can get to an instant mega-hit, having already broken 15 million copies in circulation before its anime has even aired. With the impossibly polished trailers and visuals released ahead of this premiere, you had a perfect recipe for hype. Thankfully, all that buildup was worth it, as SPY x FAMILY is easily the sharpest, slickest premiere of the season, and quite possibly the whole year.    Just pardon me for a moment while I gush about how good this show looks. The character designs do a beautiful job bringing the simple and expressive nature of Tatsuya Endō's art to life, while also looking perfect in motion. The storyboarding and direction are in a class of their own compared to anything else that's aired this season, channeling the thrill of a classic spy movie without ever feeling gimmicky. And the amount of expressive character animation, be it in action scenes or simple comedy bits, brings the cast to life wonderfully. Through the visuals alone, this is about as close to a dream adaptation as you can get. That's no easy task considering how wide a net the show casts in both tone and plot, bouncing between cute-as-hell family comedy and life-or-death action setpieces. But this episode manages to portray both with equal energy and impact.    Of course, looking good wouldn't salvage things if the story and characters weren't engaging, and that's where this series really shines. Twilight (now “Loid Forger”) is a perfect conduit for the mix of silly and serious spy shenanigans shown in this setting, acting the stone-faced straight man to his ludicrous mission while nonetheless taking it 1000% seriously. It makes Anya his perfect foil as she breaks through his stoic exterior, both with her telepathy and sheer dumbassery, and every moment we see them interact is hilarious, right up until things suddenly get emotional. This could very well have gotten by on just being a comedy about a spy dad failing to keep secrets from his adoptive daughter and letting hijinks ensue, but by the end of this episode you feel a genuine connection between Loid and his new daughter, even if he wouldn't admit it himself. That's the crack in his façade that really matters, and it gives a slick and confident premiere that little extra heart it needs to be outstanding.    Though that particular dichotomy is perhaps the biggest place where this premiere might lose folks. SPY x FAMILY operates in a very precarious space between a goofy comedy of coincidences and a serious spy thriller, where the result is a world that mostly runs on cartoon logic. But that balance is hard to nail down, and the introduction struggles with it the most, trying to pull genuine emotion out of a Master of Disguise-style spy and a girl who randomly has mind-reading powers. Ultimately the resolution of this episode is sweet and earnest enough to make that work, but I wouldn't blame anybody for scratching their head when the narration nonchalantly explains that Anya has superpowers. That's just how this world works, and you've got to be on board for that to get to the good stuff.    If, however, you can roll with this wacky take on the Cold War, this is a fantastic time that promises to be one of the highlights of the season. And if you're like me and already a devotee of the manga, then you can rest assured that this adaptation is in great hands so far.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Anya is a fantastic little character, isn't she? She is the heart and soul of this anime and it wouldn't work even half as well without her. The duality of her character is perfect. On one hand, she is very young—likely younger than the 6-year-old she claims to be. On the other, she is psychic and can read people's minds. The way these two halves collide is the core of both the drama and comedy of the series. Just because she can see what a person is thinking doesn't mean she is any smarter than any other girl her age. She thinks spies are like what she sees on TV and can't imagine the real danger that her new life now harbors.    Yet, despite all this, there is a legitimate connection between her and Twilight. At first, the spy has trouble connecting with the girl, simply planning to use her as cover for this latest operation and then discard her. But when he realizes that he was her as a child, abandoned and alone with no one to rely on, he knows that he can't simply abandon Anya—no matter if that is the tactically correct choice. After all, everything he's doing as a spy is to stop what happened to him from happening to others. It's great character growth, pure and simple.    But what would the characters be without a world to inhabit? Spy×Family is set in a fascinating fictional reimagining of Germany during the Cold War when the country was split in two. The technology, likewise, seems to be equivalent to that of the 60s and 70s—so we have TV and ham radios but not cell phones or laptop computers. In other words, we have a world from before the internet where the spy game was at its most personal. The aesthetic is fantastic and makes for a visually interesting world.    All in all, this is a solid premiere episode. It's got great characters and solid worldbuilding. And I am more than a little excited to see what happens when “mom” enters into the strange new family next week.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I've said in basically all of my reviews of the manga SPY x FAMILY is based on that Anya is the beating heart of the series, and I'm pleased to report that the same holds true of the anime adaptation. That was by no means a certainty – as we've seen in other shows, getting little kids right is no easy feat, and Anya could easily have come off as twee or artificial. And yes, she does have a few “what adults think kids are like” moments, but that doesn't take away from the way that she wriggles her way into Twilight's life and makes a place for her there. It's like a dad anime with a dose of Cold War spy caper thrown in for good measure.    Of course, it's technically the other way around. Twilight, our protagonist, is a spy tasked with maintaining peace between East and West Totally-Not-Germany during the mid-twentieth century. (Despite a couple of clear shots of the number “89,” it looks more like we're in the 60s than the 80s based on technology and vehicles, to say nothing of Twilight's flashback to what appears to be WWII.) His latest mission is the most dangerous and difficult yet: in order to get to his target, he needs a family. At first it looks like just a kid he can get enrolled in the target's prestigious school is enough, but by the end of the episode, it turns out that a wife will be necessary as well. Since he's clearly learning this “meaningful human interaction” thing from the ground up, this is very likely to be his toughest challenge yet.    Does that make it a good thing or a bad thing that the kid he picks out at the world's shadiest orphanage is a psychic? The jury's still out on that one when it comes to the mission, but in terms of the story, it's definitely a good thing. Anya, who is absolutely not quite six years old as she claims, is desperate for a family, and since her favorite cartoon involves spies, she's thrilled to have a new dad who is one – not that he knows that she knows. But it's also a source of insecurity for the little girl, because she can hear every single thought that goes through “Loid Forger's” head, and that plus her abandonment issues makes her a very insecure child desperately craving security. The episode doesn't shy away from that pathos, although it also doesn't dwell on it; quiet scenes like Anya snuggling under a sleeping Twilight's arm give us reassurance even as Twilight's struggle with parenthood and Anya's powers are played for laughs. It's a tough balance to strike, but the episode largely pulls it off.    There are also plenty of very good details in the backgrounds and props of the story, which give this the feeling of a grounded, fully realized world. They can be a bit on the nose, of course – one newspaper clearly shows the words “cold war” just in case you didn't get when the setting is – but mostly they just work to enhance the reality of the setting. Animation is fluid when it needs to be, such as the fight scene in Twilight's apartment, and if Anya's pink hair stands out in the otherwise realistic color scheme, that's very likely on purpose. As a fan of the source material, I'm very happy with this adaptation, and even if you haven't read the manga, this is absolutely worth checking out – especially if you're a fan of found family stories.     discuss this in the forum (249 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          14 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr 10, 07:52 14 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Spy×Family   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7              What is this?   Agent Twilight, the greatest spy for the nation of Westalis, has to infiltrate an elite private school. In order to do so he assumes the identity of psychiatrist Loid Forger, adopts an orphan girl, and marries a city hall employee. Unknown to him, his daughter Anya is a telepath and his wife Yor is an assassin. The three learn to become a family while working to complete Twilight's missions and maintain world peace. (from manga)   Spy×Family is based on Tatsuya Endō's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitin Moore  Rating:                As this season's Jump+ entry, SPY x FAMILY is easily the most anticipated series out of the three dozen or so series that have premiered over the last couple of weeks. And for once, I'm right here along with everyone else who was anticipating the heck out of it. That's because unlike most of the magazine's series that get turned into anime megahits, SPY x FAMILY's focus isn't primarily on fanservice, but on some of the most consistently funny, wholesome comedy in manga today.    I'm aware that as an American adult woman, I am well outside of SPY x FAMILY's target demographic, so please understand that I'm being tongue-in-cheek when I say this but: this series was made for me. Loid Forger is stunningly attractive both dressed up and dressed down, and doing his best to be a dad to Anya, who is melting his heart despite his attempts at retaining cold professionalism. Anya's psychic powers may get her out of scrapes and let her look smarter than she really is, but that doesn't make her overly precocious or sassy. When it comes to things other than giving correct answers, it's an accurate representation of how young children try to piece together meaning out of what they overhear from adults based on their limited understanding of the world. The two play off each other beautifully, and their relationship quickly becomes heartwarming as it becomes clear that Loid needs Anya not just as a spy on a mission, but as a person who is starved for human connection.    (Oh, and Yor isn't here yet but she's hot too and that's why SPY x FAMILY is bisexual culture.)    Unfortunately, it can be difficult to review comedy in a way that isn't just reciting the best jokes while I chuckle to myself, which is terribly unfunny to read so I'll spare you that pain and just encourage you to give it a shot, even if you're already familiar with the manga. I've always liked Kazuhiro Furuhashi as a director – I'm one of those weirdos who prefers the looser 1999 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter, which Furuhashi helmed, to 2011's shot-for-shot remake of the manga – and here he serves the source material well, with a consistent sense of comic timing to perfectly deliver each joke.    If you only watch one anime this season… pick the series that sounds most interesting to you, because taste is subjective and we all have our own preferences. But if you're stymied by the selection, SPY x FAMILY is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser and a solid choice for almost everyone.       James Beckett  Rating:               Hot damn! That is how you handle an adaptation. I am woefully behind on the manga version of SPY x FAMILY, but when I read that first chapter a while back, it made a huge impression, compelling and entertaining as it was. An anime was practically inevitable, and hype for the series only grew when it was confirmed that Wit Studio would be handling the production (alongside CloverWorks, who admittedly have a spottier track record as of late). I don't think anyone was ever expecting this show to be anything less than very good, but I have good news for any of the doubters left out there: SPY x FAMILY isn't just “very good”, it's fan-freakin'-tastic.    The key to SPY x FAMILY's success is the strength of its foundations. A comedy-thriller about a stone-cold spy becoming the father figure of an impossibly cute child (who also happens to be a telepath) is just a kickass concept, no matter the medium, and author Tatsuya Endō takes advantage of every hilarious and heartwarming ounce of potential that he can squeeze from it. Twilight/“Loid” is a great protagonist for this story, because his complete detachment from his own emotions makes perfect sense given his dangerous occupation, but it also allows for some damned funny shenanigans to ensue once he gets roped into the absurdity of “Operation Strix”.    The breakout star of the show, though, is clearly going to be Anya, who is so utterly precious and delightful that SPY x FAMILY ought to be arrested for conspiracy to drive its tens of thousands of viewers into sweetness-induced comas. Other anime need to take note: This is how you write a smart and intelligent kid that still sounds and behaves like a reasonable approximation of a real human child. My favorite scenes of this premiere all came from Anya just being a little goofball despite her powers and her smarts, like when she inadvertently summons a hit squad to her new villa when she messes around with Twilight's spy gear.    Speaking of the hit squad, another thing that SPY x FAMILY has going for it are it's gorgeous production values. Wit and CloverWorks are clearly going for broke here, because some of the kickass action scenes that we get between Twilight and the bad guys are straight-up cinematic in their framing and fluidity. SPY x FAMILY is a comedy first, but it doesn't forget that a spy story damn well better have some thrills in it, if only because it makes the jokes and the drama that follow hit that much harder.    Ultimately, though, what won me over to SPY x FAMILY is its heart. This show is just so cute, you guys, and I can't handle it. When Twilight picked up Anya and told her how well she did after the entrance exams, and you see her beam with pride and love…I cried like a baby, okay? I'm an easy mark for stories like this already, and SPY x FAMILY makes it impossible to resist when it does everything it sets out to do so damned well. This show is adorable, funny, and cool as hell, and it shot straight to the top of my Must Watch List of the season, just like I knew it would.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               To call this show the most anticipated title of the season would be a bit of an understatement. The original manga is about as close as you can get to an instant mega-hit, having already broken 15 million copies in circulation before its anime has even aired. With the impossibly polished trailers and visuals released ahead of this premiere, you had a perfect recipe for hype. Thankfully, all that buildup was worth it, as SPY x FAMILY is easily the sharpest, slickest premiere of the season, and quite possibly the whole year.    Just pardon me for a moment while I gush about how good this show looks. The character designs do a beautiful job bringing the simple and expressive nature of Tatsuya Endō's art to life, while also looking perfect in motion. The storyboarding and direction are in a class of their own compared to anything else that's aired this season, channeling the thrill of a classic spy movie without ever feeling gimmicky. And the amount of expressive character animation, be it in action scenes or simple comedy bits, brings the cast to life wonderfully. Through the visuals alone, this is about as close to a dream adaptation as you can get. That's no easy task considering how wide a net the show casts in both tone and plot, bouncing between cute-as-hell family comedy and life-or-death action setpieces. But this episode manages to portray both with equal energy and impact.    Of course, looking good wouldn't salvage things if the story and characters weren't engaging, and that's where this series really shines. Twilight (now “Loid Forger”) is a perfect conduit for the mix of silly and serious spy shenanigans shown in this setting, acting the stone-faced straight man to his ludicrous mission while nonetheless taking it 1000% seriously. It makes Anya his perfect foil as she breaks through his stoic exterior, both with her telepathy and sheer dumbassery, and every moment we see them interact is hilarious, right up until things suddenly get emotional. This could very well have gotten by on just being a comedy about a spy dad failing to keep secrets from his adoptive daughter and letting hijinks ensue, but by the end of this episode you feel a genuine connection between Loid and his new daughter, even if he wouldn't admit it himself. That's the crack in his façade that really matters, and it gives a slick and confident premiere that little extra heart it needs to be outstanding.    Though that particular dichotomy is perhaps the biggest place where this premiere might lose folks. SPY x FAMILY operates in a very precarious space between a goofy comedy of coincidences and a serious spy thriller, where the result is a world that mostly runs on cartoon logic. But that balance is hard to nail down, and the introduction struggles with it the most, trying to pull genuine emotion out of a Master of Disguise-style spy and a girl who randomly has mind-reading powers. Ultimately the resolution of this episode is sweet and earnest enough to make that work, but I wouldn't blame anybody for scratching their head when the narration nonchalantly explains that Anya has superpowers. That's just how this world works, and you've got to be on board for that to get to the good stuff.    If, however, you can roll with this wacky take on the Cold War, this is a fantastic time that promises to be one of the highlights of the season. And if you're like me and already a devotee of the manga, then you can rest assured that this adaptation is in great hands so far.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Anya is a fantastic little character, isn't she? She is the heart and soul of this anime and it wouldn't work even half as well without her. The duality of her character is perfect. On one hand, she is very young—likely younger than the 6-year-old she claims to be. On the other, she is psychic and can read people's minds. The way these two halves collide is the core of both the drama and comedy of the series. Just because she can see what a person is thinking doesn't mean she is any smarter than any other girl her age. She thinks spies are like what she sees on TV and can't imagine the real danger that her new life now harbors.    Yet, despite all this, there is a legitimate connection between her and Twilight. At first, the spy has trouble connecting with the girl, simply planning to use her as cover for this latest operation and then discard her. But when he realizes that he was her as a child, abandoned and alone with no one to rely on, he knows that he can't simply abandon Anya—no matter if that is the tactically correct choice. After all, everything he's doing as a spy is to stop what happened to him from happening to others. It's great character growth, pure and simple.    But what would the characters be without a world to inhabit? Spy×Family is set in a fascinating fictional reimagining of Germany during the Cold War when the country was split in two. The technology, likewise, seems to be equivalent to that of the 60s and 70s—so we have TV and ham radios but not cell phones or laptop computers. In other words, we have a world from before the internet where the spy game was at its most personal. The aesthetic is fantastic and makes for a visually interesting world.    All in all, this is a solid premiere episode. It's got great characters and solid worldbuilding. And I am more than a little excited to see what happens when “mom” enters into the strange new family next week.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I've said in basically all of my reviews of the manga SPY x FAMILY is based on that Anya is the beating heart of the series, and I'm pleased to report that the same holds true of the anime adaptation. That was by no means a certainty – as we've seen in other shows, getting little kids right is no easy feat, and Anya could easily have come off as twee or artificial. And yes, she does have a few “what adults think kids are like” moments, but that doesn't take away from the way that she wriggles her way into Twilight's life and makes a place for her there. It's like a dad anime with a dose of Cold War spy caper thrown in for good measure.    Of course, it's technically the other way around. Twilight, our protagonist, is a spy tasked with maintaining peace between East and West Totally-Not-Germany during the mid-twentieth century. (Despite a couple of clear shots of the number “89,” it looks more like we're in the 60s than the 80s based on technology and vehicles, to say nothing of Twilight's flashback to what appears to be WWII.) His latest mission is the most dangerous and difficult yet: in order to get to his target, he needs a family. At first it looks like just a kid he can get enrolled in the target's prestigious school is enough, but by the end of the episode, it turns out that a wife will be necessary as well. Since he's clearly learning this “meaningful human interaction” thing from the ground up, this is very likely to be his toughest challenge yet.    Does that make it a good thing or a bad thing that the kid he picks out at the world's shadiest orphanage is a psychic? The jury's still out on that one when it comes to the mission, but in terms of the story, it's definitely a good thing. Anya, who is absolutely not quite six years old as she claims, is desperate for a family, and since her favorite cartoon involves spies, she's thrilled to have a new dad who is one – not that he knows that she knows. But it's also a source of insecurity for the little girl, because she can hear every single thought that goes through “Loid Forger's” head, and that plus her abandonment issues makes her a very insecure child desperately craving security. The episode doesn't shy away from that pathos, although it also doesn't dwell on it; quiet scenes like Anya snuggling under a sleeping Twilight's arm give us reassurance even as Twilight's struggle with parenthood and Anya's powers are played for laughs. It's a tough balance to strike, but the episode largely pulls it off.    There are also plenty of very good details in the backgrounds and props of the story, which give this the feeling of a grounded, fully realized world. They can be a bit on the nose, of course – one newspaper clearly shows the words “cold war” just in case you didn't get when the setting is – but mostly they just work to enhance the reality of the setting. Animation is fluid when it needs to be, such as the fight scene in Twilight's apartment, and if Anya's pink hair stands out in the otherwise realistic color scheme, that's very likely on purpose.

With the impossibly polished trailers and visuals released ahead of this premiere, you had a perfect recipe for hype. Thankfully, all that buildup was worth it, as SPY x FAMILY is easily the sharpest, slickest premiere of the season, and quite possibly the whole year.    Just pardon me for a moment while I gush about how good this show looks. The character designs do a beautiful job bringing the simple and expressive nature of Tatsuya Endō's art to life, while also looking perfect in motion. The storyboarding and direction are in a class of their own compared to anything else that's aired this season, channeling the thrill of a classic spy movie without ever feeling gimmicky. And the amount of expressive character animation, be it in action scenes or simple comedy bits, brings the cast to life wonderfully. Through the visuals alone, this is about as close to a dream adaptation as you can get. That's no easy task considering how wide a net the show casts in both tone and plot, bouncing between cute-as-hell family comedy and life-or-death action setpieces. But this episode manages to portray both with equal energy and impact.    Of course, looking good wouldn't salvage things if the story and characters weren't engaging, and that's where this series really shines. Twilight (now “Loid Forger”) is a perfect conduit for the mix of silly and serious spy shenanigans shown in this setting, acting the stone-faced straight man to his ludicrous mission while nonetheless taking it 1000% seriously. It makes Anya his perfect foil as she breaks through his stoic exterior, both with her telepathy and sheer dumbassery, and every moment we see them interact is hilarious, right up until things suddenly get emotional. This could very well have gotten by on just being a comedy about a spy dad failing to keep secrets from his adoptive daughter and letting hijinks ensue, but by the end of this episode you feel a genuine connection between Loid and his new daughter, even if he wouldn't admit it himself. That's the crack in his façade that really matters, and it gives a slick and confident premiere that little extra heart it needs to be outstanding.    Though that particular dichotomy is perhaps the biggest place where this premiere might lose folks. SPY x FAMILY operates in a very precarious space between a goofy comedy of coincidences and a serious spy thriller, where the result is a world that mostly runs on cartoon logic. But that balance is hard to nail down, and the introduction struggles with it the most, trying to pull genuine emotion out of a Master of Disguise-style spy and a girl who randomly has mind-reading powers. Ultimately the resolution of this episode is sweet and earnest enough to make that work, but I wouldn't blame anybody for scratching their head when the narration nonchalantly explains that Anya has superpowers. That's just how this world works, and you've got to be on board for that to get to the good stuff.    If, however, you can roll with this wacky take on the Cold War, this is a fantastic time that promises to be one of the highlights of the season. And if you're like me and already a devotee of the manga, then you can rest assured that this adaptation is in great hands so far.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Anya is a fantastic little character, isn't she? She is the heart and soul of this anime and it wouldn't work even half as well without her. The duality of her character is perfect. On one hand, she is very young—likely younger than the 6-year-old she claims to be. On the other, she is psychic and can read people's minds. The way these two halves collide is the core of both the drama and comedy of the series. Just because she can see what a person is thinking doesn't mean she is any smarter than any other girl her age. She thinks spies are like what she sees on TV and can't imagine the real danger that her new life now harbors.    Yet, despite all this, there is a legitimate connection between her and Twilight. At first, the spy has trouble connecting with the girl, simply planning to use her as cover for this latest operation and then discard her. But when he realizes that he was her as a child, abandoned and alone with no one to rely on, he knows that he can't simply abandon Anya—no matter if that is the tactically correct choice. After all, everything he's doing as a spy is to stop what happened to him from happening to others. It's great character growth, pure and simple.    But what would the characters be without a world to inhabit? Spy×Family is set in a fascinating fictional reimagining of Germany during the Cold War when the country was split in two. The technology, likewise, seems to be equivalent to that of the 60s and 70s—so we have TV and ham radios but not cell phones or laptop computers. In other words, we have a world from before the internet where the spy game was at its most personal. The aesthetic is fantastic and makes for a visually interesting world.    All in all, this is a solid premiere episode. It's got great characters and solid worldbuilding. And I am more than a little excited to see what happens when “mom” enters into the strange new family next week.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I've said in basically all of my reviews of the manga SPY x FAMILY is based on that Anya is the beating heart of the series, and I'm pleased to report that the same holds true of the anime adaptation. That was by no means a certainty – as we've seen in other shows, getting little kids right is no easy feat, and Anya could easily have come off as twee or artificial. And yes, she does have a few “what adults think kids are like” moments, but that doesn't take away from the way that she wriggles her way into Twilight's life and makes a place for her there. It's like a dad anime with a dose of Cold War spy caper thrown in for good measure.    Of course, it's technically the other way around. Twilight, our protagonist, is a spy tasked with maintaining peace between East and West Totally-Not-Germany during the mid-twentieth century. (Despite a couple of clear shots of the number “89,” it looks more like we're in the 60s than the 80s based on technology and vehicles, to say nothing of Twilight's flashback to what appears to be WWII.) His latest mission is the most dangerous and difficult yet: in order to get to his target, he needs a family. At first it looks like just a kid he can get enrolled in the target's prestigious school is enough, but by the end of the episode, it turns out that a wife will be necessary as well. Since he's clearly learning this “meaningful human interaction” thing from the ground up, this is very likely to be his toughest challenge yet.    Does that make it a good thing or a bad thing that the kid he picks out at the world's shadiest orphanage is a psychic? The jury's still out on that one when it comes to the mission, but in terms of the story, it's definitely a good thing. Anya, who is absolutely not quite six years old as she claims, is desperate for a family, and since her favorite cartoon involves spies, she's thrilled to have a new dad who is one – not that he knows that she knows. But it's also a source of insecurity for the little girl, because she can hear every single thought that goes through “Loid Forger's” head, and that plus her abandonment issues makes her a very insecure child desperately craving security. The episode doesn't shy away from that pathos, although it also doesn't dwell on it; quiet scenes like Anya snuggling under a sleeping Twilight's arm give us reassurance even as Twilight's struggle with parenthood and Anya's powers are played for laughs. It's a tough balance to strike, but the episode largely pulls it off.    There are also plenty of very good details in the backgrounds and props of the story, which give this the feeling of a grounded, fully realized world. They can be a bit on the nose, of course – one newspaper clearly shows the words “cold war” just in case you didn't get when the setting is – but mostly they just work to enhance the reality of the setting. Animation is fluid when it needs to be, such as the fight scene in Twilight's apartment, and if Anya's pink hair stands out in the otherwise realistic color scheme, that's very likely on purpose. As a fan of the source material, I'm very happy with this adaptation, and even if you haven't read the manga, this is absolutely worth checking out – especially if you're a fan of found family stories.     discuss this in the forum (249 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Spy×Family   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7              What is this?   Agent Twilight, the greatest spy for the nation of Westalis, has to infiltrate an elite private school. In order to do so he assumes the identity of psychiatrist Loid Forger, adopts an orphan girl, and marries a city hall employee. Unknown to him, his daughter Anya is a telepath and his wife Yor is an assassin. The three learn to become a family while working to complete Twilight's missions and maintain world peace. (from manga)   Spy×Family is based on Tatsuya Endō's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitin Moore  Rating:                As this season's Jump+ entry, SPY x FAMILY is easily the most anticipated series out of the three dozen or so series that have premiered over the last couple of weeks. And for once, I'm right here along with everyone else who was anticipating the heck out of it. That's because unlike most of the magazine's series that get turned into anime megahits, SPY x FAMILY's focus isn't primarily on fanservice, but on some of the most consistently funny, wholesome comedy in manga today.    I'm aware that as an American adult woman, I am well outside of SPY x FAMILY's target demographic, so please understand that I'm being tongue-in-cheek when I say this but: this series was made for me. Loid Forger is stunningly attractive both dressed up and dressed down, and doing his best to be a dad to Anya, who is melting his heart despite his attempts at retaining cold professionalism. Anya's psychic powers may get her out of scrapes and let her look smarter than she really is, but that doesn't make her overly precocious or sassy. When it comes to things other than giving correct answers, it's an accurate representation of how young children try to piece together meaning out of what they overhear from adults based on their limited understanding of the world. The two play off each other beautifully, and their relationship quickly becomes heartwarming as it becomes clear that Loid needs Anya not just as a spy on a mission, but as a person who is starved for human connection.    (Oh, and Yor isn't here yet but she's hot too and that's why SPY x FAMILY is bisexual culture.)    Unfortunately, it can be difficult to review comedy in a way that isn't just reciting the best jokes while I chuckle to myself, which is terribly unfunny to read so I'll spare you that pain and just encourage you to give it a shot, even if you're already familiar with the manga. I've always liked Kazuhiro Furuhashi as a director – I'm one of those weirdos who prefers the looser 1999 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter, which Furuhashi helmed, to 2011's shot-for-shot remake of the manga – and here he serves the source material well, with a consistent sense of comic timing to perfectly deliver each joke.    If you only watch one anime this season… pick the series that sounds most interesting to you, because taste is subjective and we all have our own preferences. But if you're stymied by the selection, SPY x FAMILY is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser and a solid choice for almost everyone.       James Beckett  Rating:               Hot damn! That is how you handle an adaptation. I am woefully behind on the manga version of SPY x FAMILY, but when I read that first chapter a while back, it made a huge impression, compelling and entertaining as it was. An anime was practically inevitable, and hype for the series only grew when it was confirmed that Wit Studio would be handling the production (alongside CloverWorks, who admittedly have a spottier track record as of late). I don't think anyone was ever expecting this show to be anything less than very good, but I have good news for any of the doubters left out there: SPY x FAMILY isn't just “very good”, it's fan-freakin'-tastic.    The key to SPY x FAMILY's success is the strength of its foundations. A comedy-thriller about a stone-cold spy becoming the father figure of an impossibly cute child (who also happens to be a telepath) is just a kickass concept, no matter the medium, and author Tatsuya Endō takes advantage of every hilarious and heartwarming ounce of potential that he can squeeze from it. Twilight/“Loid” is a great protagonist for this story, because his complete detachment from his own emotions makes perfect sense given his dangerous occupation, but it also allows for some damned funny shenanigans to ensue once he gets roped into the absurdity of “Operation Strix”.    The breakout star of the show, though, is clearly going to be Anya, who is so utterly precious and delightful that SPY x FAMILY ought to be arrested for conspiracy to drive its tens of thousands of viewers into sweetness-induced comas. Other anime need to take note: This is how you write a smart and intelligent kid that still sounds and behaves like a reasonable approximation of a real human child. My favorite scenes of this premiere all came from Anya just being a little goofball despite her powers and her smarts, like when she inadvertently summons a hit squad to her new villa when she messes around with Twilight's spy gear.    Speaking of the hit squad, another thing that SPY x FAMILY has going for it are it's gorgeous production values. Wit and CloverWorks are clearly going for broke here, because some of the kickass action scenes that we get between Twilight and the bad guys are straight-up cinematic in their framing and fluidity. SPY x FAMILY is a comedy first, but it doesn't forget that a spy story damn well better have some thrills in it, if only because it makes the jokes and the drama that follow hit that much harder.    Ultimately, though, what won me over to SPY x FAMILY is its heart. This show is just so cute, you guys, and I can't handle it. When Twilight picked up Anya and told her how well she did after the entrance exams, and you see her beam with pride and love…I cried like a baby, okay? I'm an easy mark for stories like this already, and SPY x FAMILY makes it impossible to resist when it does everything it sets out to do so damned well. This show is adorable, funny, and cool as hell, and it shot straight to the top of my Must Watch List of the season, just like I knew it would.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               To call this show the most anticipated title of the season would be a bit of an understatement.

Through the visuals alone, this is about as close to a dream adaptation as you can get. That's no easy task considering how wide a net the show casts in both tone and plot, bouncing between cute-as-hell family comedy and life-or-death action setpieces. But this episode manages to portray both with equal energy and impact.    Of course, looking good wouldn't salvage things if the story and characters weren't engaging, and that's where this series really shines. Twilight (now “Loid Forger”) is a perfect conduit for the mix of silly and serious spy shenanigans shown in this setting, acting the stone-faced straight man to his ludicrous mission while nonetheless taking it 1000% seriously. It makes Anya his perfect foil as she breaks through his stoic exterior, both with her telepathy and sheer dumbassery, and every moment we see them interact is hilarious, right up until things suddenly get emotional. This could very well have gotten by on just being a comedy about a spy dad failing to keep secrets from his adoptive daughter and letting hijinks ensue, but by the end of this episode you feel a genuine connection between Loid and his new daughter, even if he wouldn't admit it himself. That's the crack in his façade that really matters, and it gives a slick and confident premiere that little extra heart it needs to be outstanding.    Though that particular dichotomy is perhaps the biggest place where this premiere might lose folks. SPY x FAMILY operates in a very precarious space between a goofy comedy of coincidences and a serious spy thriller, where the result is a world that mostly runs on cartoon logic. But that balance is hard to nail down, and the introduction struggles with it the most, trying to pull genuine emotion out of a Master of Disguise-style spy and a girl who randomly has mind-reading powers. Ultimately the resolution of this episode is sweet and earnest enough to make that work, but I wouldn't blame anybody for scratching their head when the narration nonchalantly explains that Anya has superpowers. That's just how this world works, and you've got to be on board for that to get to the good stuff.    If, however, you can roll with this wacky take on the Cold War, this is a fantastic time that promises to be one of the highlights of the season. And if you're like me and already a devotee of the manga, then you can rest assured that this adaptation is in great hands so far.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Anya is a fantastic little character, isn't she? She is the heart and soul of this anime and it wouldn't work even half as well without her. The duality of her character is perfect. On one hand, she is very young—likely younger than the 6-year-old she claims to be. On the other, she is psychic and can read people's minds. The way these two halves collide is the core of both the drama and comedy of the series. Just because she can see what a person is thinking doesn't mean she is any smarter than any other girl her age. She thinks spies are like what she sees on TV and can't imagine the real danger that her new life now harbors.    Yet, despite all this, there is a legitimate connection between her and Twilight. At first, the spy has trouble connecting with the girl, simply planning to use her as cover for this latest operation and then discard her. But when he realizes that he was her as a child, abandoned and alone with no one to rely on, he knows that he can't simply abandon Anya—no matter if that is the tactically correct choice. After all, everything he's doing as a spy is to stop what happened to him from happening to others. It's great character growth, pure and simple.    But what would the characters be without a world to inhabit? Spy×Family is set in a fascinating fictional reimagining of Germany during the Cold War when the country was split in two. The technology, likewise, seems to be equivalent to that of the 60s and 70s—so we have TV and ham radios but not cell phones or laptop computers. In other words, we have a world from before the internet where the spy game was at its most personal. The aesthetic is fantastic and makes for a visually interesting world.    All in all, this is a solid premiere episode. It's got great characters and solid worldbuilding. And I am more than a little excited to see what happens when “mom” enters into the strange new family next week.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I've said in basically all of my reviews of the manga SPY x FAMILY is based on that Anya is the beating heart of the series, and I'm pleased to report that the same holds true of the anime adaptation. That was by no means a certainty – as we've seen in other shows, getting little kids right is no easy feat, and Anya could easily have come off as twee or artificial. And yes, she does have a few “what adults think kids are like” moments, but that doesn't take away from the way that she wriggles her way into Twilight's life and makes a place for her there. It's like a dad anime with a dose of Cold War spy caper thrown in for good measure.    Of course, it's technically the other way around. Twilight, our protagonist, is a spy tasked with maintaining peace between East and West Totally-Not-Germany during the mid-twentieth century. (Despite a couple of clear shots of the number “89,” it looks more like we're in the 60s than the 80s based on technology and vehicles, to say nothing of Twilight's flashback to what appears to be WWII.) His latest mission is the most dangerous and difficult yet: in order to get to his target, he needs a family. At first it looks like just a kid he can get enrolled in the target's prestigious school is enough, but by the end of the episode, it turns out that a wife will be necessary as well. Since he's clearly learning this “meaningful human interaction” thing from the ground up, this is very likely to be his toughest challenge yet.    Does that make it a good thing or a bad thing that the kid he picks out at the world's shadiest orphanage is a psychic? The jury's still out on that one when it comes to the mission, but in terms of the story, it's definitely a good thing. Anya, who is absolutely not quite six years old as she claims, is desperate for a family, and since her favorite cartoon involves spies, she's thrilled to have a new dad who is one – not that he knows that she knows. But it's also a source of insecurity for the little girl, because she can hear every single thought that goes through “Loid Forger's” head, and that plus her abandonment issues makes her a very insecure child desperately craving security. The episode doesn't shy away from that pathos, although it also doesn't dwell on it; quiet scenes like Anya snuggling under a sleeping Twilight's arm give us reassurance even as Twilight's struggle with parenthood and Anya's powers are played for laughs. It's a tough balance to strike, but the episode largely pulls it off.    There are also plenty of very good details in the backgrounds and props of the story, which give this the feeling of a grounded, fully realized world. They can be a bit on the nose, of course – one newspaper clearly shows the words “cold war” just in case you didn't get when the setting is – but mostly they just work to enhance the reality of the setting. Animation is fluid when it needs to be, such as the fight scene in Twilight's apartment, and if Anya's pink hair stands out in the otherwise realistic color scheme, that's very likely on purpose. As a fan of the source material, I'm very happy with this adaptation, and even if you haven't read the manga, this is absolutely worth checking out – especially if you're a fan of found family stories.     discuss this in the forum (249 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,{}
10-04-2022,anime,8,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/spy-family/.183646,Spy×Family - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"   The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Spy×Family   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7              What is this?   Agent Twilight, the greatest spy for the nation of Westalis, has to infiltrate an elite private school. In order to do so he assumes the identity of psychiatrist Loid Forger, adopts an orphan girl, and marries a city hall employee. Unknown to him, his daughter Anya is a telepath and his wife Yor is an assassin. The three learn to become a family while working to complete Twilight's missions and maintain world peace. (from manga)   Spy×Family is based on Tatsuya Endō's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitin Moore  Rating:                As this season's Jump+ entry, SPY x FAMILY is easily the most anticipated series out of the three dozen or so series that have premiered over the last couple of weeks. And for once, I'm right here along with everyone else who was anticipating the heck out of it. That's because unlike most of the magazine's series that get turned into anime megahits, SPY x FAMILY's focus isn't primarily on fanservice, but on some of the most consistently funny, wholesome comedy in manga today.    I'm aware that as an American adult woman, I am well outside of SPY x FAMILY's target demographic, so please understand that I'm being tongue-in-cheek when I say this but: this series was made for me. Loid Forger is stunningly attractive both dressed up and dressed down, and doing his best to be a dad to Anya, who is melting his heart despite his attempts at retaining cold professionalism. Anya's psychic powers may get her out of scrapes and let her look smarter than she really is, but that doesn't make her overly precocious or sassy. When it comes to things other than giving correct answers, it's an accurate representation of how young children try to piece together meaning out of what they overhear from adults based on their limited understanding of the world. The two play off each other beautifully, and their relationship quickly becomes heartwarming as it becomes clear that Loid needs Anya not just as a spy on a mission, but as a person who is starved for human connection.    (Oh, and Yor isn't here yet but she's hot too and that's why SPY x FAMILY is bisexual culture.)    Unfortunately, it can be difficult to review comedy in a way that isn't just reciting the best jokes while I chuckle to myself, which is terribly unfunny to read so I'll spare you that pain and just encourage you to give it a shot, even if you're already familiar with the manga. I've always liked Kazuhiro Furuhashi as a director – I'm one of those weirdos who prefers the looser 1999 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter, which Furuhashi helmed, to 2011's shot-for-shot remake of the manga – and here he serves the source material well, with a consistent sense of comic timing to perfectly deliver each joke.    If you only watch one anime this season… pick the series that sounds most interesting to you, because taste is subjective and we all have our own preferences. But if you're stymied by the selection, SPY x FAMILY is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser and a solid choice for almost everyone.       James Beckett  Rating:               Hot damn! That is how you handle an adaptation. I am woefully behind on the manga version of SPY x FAMILY, but when I read that first chapter a while back, it made a huge impression, compelling and entertaining as it was. An anime was practically inevitable, and hype for the series only grew when it was confirmed that Wit Studio would be handling the production (alongside CloverWorks, who admittedly have a spottier track record as of late). I don't think anyone was ever expecting this show to be anything less than very good, but I have good news for any of the doubters left out there: SPY x FAMILY isn't just “very good”, it's fan-freakin'-tastic.    The key to SPY x FAMILY's success is the strength of its foundations. A comedy-thriller about a stone-cold spy becoming the father figure of an impossibly cute child (who also happens to be a telepath) is just a kickass concept, no matter the medium, and author Tatsuya Endō takes advantage of every hilarious and heartwarming ounce of potential that he can squeeze from it. Twilight/“Loid” is a great protagonist for this story, because his complete detachment from his own emotions makes perfect sense given his dangerous occupation, but it also allows for some damned funny shenanigans to ensue once he gets roped into the absurdity of “Operation Strix”.    The breakout star of the show, though, is clearly going to be Anya, who is so utterly precious and delightful that SPY x FAMILY ought to be arrested for conspiracy to drive its tens of thousands of viewers into sweetness-induced comas. Other anime need to take note: This is how you write a smart and intelligent kid that still sounds and behaves like a reasonable approximation of a real human child. My favorite scenes of this premiere all came from Anya just being a little goofball despite her powers and her smarts, like when she inadvertently summons a hit squad to her new villa when she messes around with Twilight's spy gear.    Speaking of the hit squad, another thing that SPY x FAMILY has going for it are it's gorgeous production values. Wit and CloverWorks are clearly going for broke here, because some of the kickass action scenes that we get between Twilight and the bad guys are straight-up cinematic in their framing and fluidity. SPY x FAMILY is a comedy first, but it doesn't forget that a spy story damn well better have some thrills in it, if only because it makes the jokes and the drama that follow hit that much harder.    Ultimately, though, what won me over to SPY x FAMILY is its heart. This show is just so cute, you guys, and I can't handle it. When Twilight picked up Anya and told her how well she did after the entrance exams, and you see her beam with pride and love…I cried like a baby, okay? I'm an easy mark for stories like this already, and SPY x FAMILY makes it impossible to resist when it does everything it sets out to do so damned well. This show is adorable, funny, and cool as hell, and it shot straight to the top of my Must Watch List of the season, just like I knew it would.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               To call this show the most anticipated title of the season would be a bit of an understatement. The original manga is about as close as you can get to an instant mega-hit, having already broken 15 million copies in circulation before its anime has even aired. With the impossibly polished trailers and visuals released ahead of this premiere, you had a perfect recipe for hype. Thankfully, all that buildup was worth it, as SPY x FAMILY is easily the sharpest, slickest premiere of the season, and quite possibly the whole year.    Just pardon me for a moment while I gush about how good this show looks. The character designs do a beautiful job bringing the simple and expressive nature of Tatsuya Endō's art to life, while also looking perfect in motion. The storyboarding and direction are in a class of their own compared to anything else that's aired this season, channeling the thrill of a classic spy movie without ever feeling gimmicky. And the amount of expressive character animation, be it in action scenes or simple comedy bits, brings the cast to life wonderfully.

But that balance is hard to nail down, and the introduction struggles with it the most, trying to pull genuine emotion out of a Master of Disguise-style spy and a girl who randomly has mind-reading powers. Ultimately the resolution of this episode is sweet and earnest enough to make that work, but I wouldn't blame anybody for scratching their head when the narration nonchalantly explains that Anya has superpowers. That's just how this world works, and you've got to be on board for that to get to the good stuff.    If, however, you can roll with this wacky take on the Cold War, this is a fantastic time that promises to be one of the highlights of the season. And if you're like me and already a devotee of the manga, then you can rest assured that this adaptation is in great hands so far.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Anya is a fantastic little character, isn't she? She is the heart and soul of this anime and it wouldn't work even half as well without her. The duality of her character is perfect. On one hand, she is very young—likely younger than the 6-year-old she claims to be. On the other, she is psychic and can read people's minds. The way these two halves collide is the core of both the drama and comedy of the series. Just because she can see what a person is thinking doesn't mean she is any smarter than any other girl her age. She thinks spies are like what she sees on TV and can't imagine the real danger that her new life now harbors.    Yet, despite all this, there is a legitimate connection between her and Twilight. At first, the spy has trouble connecting with the girl, simply planning to use her as cover for this latest operation and then discard her. But when he realizes that he was her as a child, abandoned and alone with no one to rely on, he knows that he can't simply abandon Anya—no matter if that is the tactically correct choice. After all, everything he's doing as a spy is to stop what happened to him from happening to others. It's great character growth, pure and simple.    But what would the characters be without a world to inhabit? Spy×Family is set in a fascinating fictional reimagining of Germany during the Cold War when the country was split in two. The technology, likewise, seems to be equivalent to that of the 60s and 70s—so we have TV and ham radios but not cell phones or laptop computers. In other words, we have a world from before the internet where the spy game was at its most personal. The aesthetic is fantastic and makes for a visually interesting world.    All in all, this is a solid premiere episode. It's got great characters and solid worldbuilding. And I am more than a little excited to see what happens when “mom” enters into the strange new family next week.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I've said in basically all of my reviews of the manga SPY x FAMILY is based on that Anya is the beating heart of the series, and I'm pleased to report that the same holds true of the anime adaptation. That was by no means a certainty – as we've seen in other shows, getting little kids right is no easy feat, and Anya could easily have come off as twee or artificial. And yes, she does have a few “what adults think kids are like” moments, but that doesn't take away from the way that she wriggles her way into Twilight's life and makes a place for her there. It's like a dad anime with a dose of Cold War spy caper thrown in for good measure.    Of course, it's technically the other way around. Twilight, our protagonist, is a spy tasked with maintaining peace between East and West Totally-Not-Germany during the mid-twentieth century. (Despite a couple of clear shots of the number “89,” it looks more like we're in the 60s than the 80s based on technology and vehicles, to say nothing of Twilight's flashback to what appears to be WWII.) His latest mission is the most dangerous and difficult yet: in order to get to his target, he needs a family. At first it looks like just a kid he can get enrolled in the target's prestigious school is enough, but by the end of the episode, it turns out that a wife will be necessary as well. Since he's clearly learning this “meaningful human interaction” thing from the ground up, this is very likely to be his toughest challenge yet.    Does that make it a good thing or a bad thing that the kid he picks out at the world's shadiest orphanage is a psychic? The jury's still out on that one when it comes to the mission, but in terms of the story, it's definitely a good thing. Anya, who is absolutely not quite six years old as she claims, is desperate for a family, and since her favorite cartoon involves spies, she's thrilled to have a new dad who is one – not that he knows that she knows. But it's also a source of insecurity for the little girl, because she can hear every single thought that goes through “Loid Forger's” head, and that plus her abandonment issues makes her a very insecure child desperately craving security. The episode doesn't shy away from that pathos, although it also doesn't dwell on it; quiet scenes like Anya snuggling under a sleeping Twilight's arm give us reassurance even as Twilight's struggle with parenthood and Anya's powers are played for laughs. It's a tough balance to strike, but the episode largely pulls it off.    There are also plenty of very good details in the backgrounds and props of the story, which give this the feeling of a grounded, fully realized world. They can be a bit on the nose, of course – one newspaper clearly shows the words “cold war” just in case you didn't get when the setting is – but mostly they just work to enhance the reality of the setting. Animation is fluid when it needs to be, such as the fight scene in Twilight's apartment, and if Anya's pink hair stands out in the otherwise realistic color scheme, that's very likely on purpose. As a fan of the source material, I'm very happy with this adaptation, and even if you haven't read the manga, this is absolutely worth checking out – especially if you're a fan of found family stories.     discuss this in the forum (249 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,{}
10-04-2022,anime,8,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/spy-family/.183646,Spy×Family - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"                How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7              What is this?   Agent Twilight, the greatest spy for the nation of Westalis, has to infiltrate an elite private school. In order to do so he assumes the identity of psychiatrist Loid Forger, adopts an orphan girl, and marries a city hall employee. Unknown to him, his daughter Anya is a telepath and his wife Yor is an assassin. The three learn to become a family while working to complete Twilight's missions and maintain world peace. (from manga)   Spy×Family is based on Tatsuya Endō's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitin Moore  Rating:                As this season's Jump+ entry, SPY x FAMILY is easily the most anticipated series out of the three dozen or so series that have premiered over the last couple of weeks. And for once, I'm right here along with everyone else who was anticipating the heck out of it. That's because unlike most of the magazine's series that get turned into anime megahits, SPY x FAMILY's focus isn't primarily on fanservice, but on some of the most consistently funny, wholesome comedy in manga today.    I'm aware that as an American adult woman, I am well outside of SPY x FAMILY's target demographic, so please understand that I'm being tongue-in-cheek when I say this but: this series was made for me. Loid Forger is stunningly attractive both dressed up and dressed down, and doing his best to be a dad to Anya, who is melting his heart despite his attempts at retaining cold professionalism. Anya's psychic powers may get her out of scrapes and let her look smarter than she really is, but that doesn't make her overly precocious or sassy. When it comes to things other than giving correct answers, it's an accurate representation of how young children try to piece together meaning out of what they overhear from adults based on their limited understanding of the world. The two play off each other beautifully, and their relationship quickly becomes heartwarming as it becomes clear that Loid needs Anya not just as a spy on a mission, but as a person who is starved for human connection.    (Oh, and Yor isn't here yet but she's hot too and that's why SPY x FAMILY is bisexual culture.)    Unfortunately, it can be difficult to review comedy in a way that isn't just reciting the best jokes while I chuckle to myself, which is terribly unfunny to read so I'll spare you that pain and just encourage you to give it a shot, even if you're already familiar with the manga. I've always liked Kazuhiro Furuhashi as a director – I'm one of those weirdos who prefers the looser 1999 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter, which Furuhashi helmed, to 2011's shot-for-shot remake of the manga – and here he serves the source material well, with a consistent sense of comic timing to perfectly deliver each joke.    If you only watch one anime this season… pick the series that sounds most interesting to you, because taste is subjective and we all have our own preferences. But if you're stymied by the selection, SPY x FAMILY is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser and a solid choice for almost everyone.       James Beckett  Rating:               Hot damn! That is how you handle an adaptation. I am woefully behind on the manga version of SPY x FAMILY, but when I read that first chapter a while back, it made a huge impression, compelling and entertaining as it was. An anime was practically inevitable, and hype for the series only grew when it was confirmed that Wit Studio would be handling the production (alongside CloverWorks, who admittedly have a spottier track record as of late). I don't think anyone was ever expecting this show to be anything less than very good, but I have good news for any of the doubters left out there: SPY x FAMILY isn't just “very good”, it's fan-freakin'-tastic.    The key to SPY x FAMILY's success is the strength of its foundations. A comedy-thriller about a stone-cold spy becoming the father figure of an impossibly cute child (who also happens to be a telepath) is just a kickass concept, no matter the medium, and author Tatsuya Endō takes advantage of every hilarious and heartwarming ounce of potential that he can squeeze from it. Twilight/“Loid” is a great protagonist for this story, because his complete detachment from his own emotions makes perfect sense given his dangerous occupation, but it also allows for some damned funny shenanigans to ensue once he gets roped into the absurdity of “Operation Strix”.    The breakout star of the show, though, is clearly going to be Anya, who is so utterly precious and delightful that SPY x FAMILY ought to be arrested for conspiracy to drive its tens of thousands of viewers into sweetness-induced comas. Other anime need to take note: This is how you write a smart and intelligent kid that still sounds and behaves like a reasonable approximation of a real human child. My favorite scenes of this premiere all came from Anya just being a little goofball despite her powers and her smarts, like when she inadvertently summons a hit squad to her new villa when she messes around with Twilight's spy gear.    Speaking of the hit squad, another thing that SPY x FAMILY has going for it are it's gorgeous production values. Wit and CloverWorks are clearly going for broke here, because some of the kickass action scenes that we get between Twilight and the bad guys are straight-up cinematic in their framing and fluidity. SPY x FAMILY is a comedy first, but it doesn't forget that a spy story damn well better have some thrills in it, if only because it makes the jokes and the drama that follow hit that much harder.    Ultimately, though, what won me over to SPY x FAMILY is its heart. This show is just so cute, you guys, and I can't handle it. When Twilight picked up Anya and told her how well she did after the entrance exams, and you see her beam with pride and love…I cried like a baby, okay? I'm an easy mark for stories like this already, and SPY x FAMILY makes it impossible to resist when it does everything it sets out to do so damned well. This show is adorable, funny, and cool as hell, and it shot straight to the top of my Must Watch List of the season, just like I knew it would.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               To call this show the most anticipated title of the season would be a bit of an understatement. The original manga is about as close as you can get to an instant mega-hit, having already broken 15 million copies in circulation before its anime has even aired. With the impossibly polished trailers and visuals released ahead of this premiere, you had a perfect recipe for hype. Thankfully, all that buildup was worth it, as SPY x FAMILY is easily the sharpest, slickest premiere of the season, and quite possibly the whole year.    Just pardon me for a moment while I gush about how good this show looks. The character designs do a beautiful job bringing the simple and expressive nature of Tatsuya Endō's art to life, while also looking perfect in motion. The storyboarding and direction are in a class of their own compared to anything else that's aired this season, channeling the thrill of a classic spy movie without ever feeling gimmicky. And the amount of expressive character animation, be it in action scenes or simple comedy bits, brings the cast to life wonderfully. Through the visuals alone, this is about as close to a dream adaptation as you can get. That's no easy task considering how wide a net the show casts in both tone and plot, bouncing between cute-as-hell family comedy and life-or-death action setpieces. But this episode manages to portray both with equal energy and impact.    Of course, looking good wouldn't salvage things if the story and characters weren't engaging, and that's where this series really shines. Twilight (now “Loid Forger”) is a perfect conduit for the mix of silly and serious spy shenanigans shown in this setting, acting the stone-faced straight man to his ludicrous mission while nonetheless taking it 1000% seriously. It makes Anya his perfect foil as she breaks through his stoic exterior, both with her telepathy and sheer dumbassery, and every moment we see them interact is hilarious, right up until things suddenly get emotional. This could very well have gotten by on just being a comedy about a spy dad failing to keep secrets from his adoptive daughter and letting hijinks ensue, but by the end of this episode you feel a genuine connection between Loid and his new daughter, even if he wouldn't admit it himself. That's the crack in his façade that really matters, and it gives a slick and confident premiere that little extra heart it needs to be outstanding.    Though that particular dichotomy is perhaps the biggest place where this premiere might lose folks. SPY x FAMILY operates in a very precarious space between a goofy comedy of coincidences and a serious spy thriller, where the result is a world that mostly runs on cartoon logic.

But when he realizes that he was her as a child, abandoned and alone with no one to rely on, he knows that he can't simply abandon Anya—no matter if that is the tactically correct choice. After all, everything he's doing as a spy is to stop what happened to him from happening to others. It's great character growth, pure and simple.    But what would the characters be without a world to inhabit? Spy×Family is set in a fascinating fictional reimagining of Germany during the Cold War when the country was split in two. The technology, likewise, seems to be equivalent to that of the 60s and 70s—so we have TV and ham radios but not cell phones or laptop computers. In other words, we have a world from before the internet where the spy game was at its most personal. The aesthetic is fantastic and makes for a visually interesting world.    All in all, this is a solid premiere episode. It's got great characters and solid worldbuilding. And I am more than a little excited to see what happens when “mom” enters into the strange new family next week.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I've said in basically all of my reviews of the manga SPY x FAMILY is based on that Anya is the beating heart of the series, and I'm pleased to report that the same holds true of the anime adaptation. That was by no means a certainty – as we've seen in other shows, getting little kids right is no easy feat, and Anya could easily have come off as twee or artificial. And yes, she does have a few “what adults think kids are like” moments, but that doesn't take away from the way that she wriggles her way into Twilight's life and makes a place for her there. It's like a dad anime with a dose of Cold War spy caper thrown in for good measure.    Of course, it's technically the other way around. Twilight, our protagonist, is a spy tasked with maintaining peace between East and West Totally-Not-Germany during the mid-twentieth century. (Despite a couple of clear shots of the number “89,” it looks more like we're in the 60s than the 80s based on technology and vehicles, to say nothing of Twilight's flashback to what appears to be WWII.) His latest mission is the most dangerous and difficult yet: in order to get to his target, he needs a family. At first it looks like just a kid he can get enrolled in the target's prestigious school is enough, but by the end of the episode, it turns out that a wife will be necessary as well. Since he's clearly learning this “meaningful human interaction” thing from the ground up, this is very likely to be his toughest challenge yet.    Does that make it a good thing or a bad thing that the kid he picks out at the world's shadiest orphanage is a psychic? The jury's still out on that one when it comes to the mission, but in terms of the story, it's definitely a good thing. Anya, who is absolutely not quite six years old as she claims, is desperate for a family, and since her favorite cartoon involves spies, she's thrilled to have a new dad who is one – not that he knows that she knows. But it's also a source of insecurity for the little girl, because she can hear every single thought that goes through “Loid Forger's” head, and that plus her abandonment issues makes her a very insecure child desperately craving security. The episode doesn't shy away from that pathos, although it also doesn't dwell on it; quiet scenes like Anya snuggling under a sleeping Twilight's arm give us reassurance even as Twilight's struggle with parenthood and Anya's powers are played for laughs. It's a tough balance to strike, but the episode largely pulls it off.    There are also plenty of very good details in the backgrounds and props of the story, which give this the feeling of a grounded, fully realized world. They can be a bit on the nose, of course – one newspaper clearly shows the words “cold war” just in case you didn't get when the setting is – but mostly they just work to enhance the reality of the setting. Animation is fluid when it needs to be, such as the fight scene in Twilight's apartment, and if Anya's pink hair stands out in the otherwise realistic color scheme, that's very likely on purpose. As a fan of the source material, I'm very happy with this adaptation, and even if you haven't read the manga, this is absolutely worth checking out – especially if you're a fan of found family stories.

10-04-2022,anime,8,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/spy-family/.183646,Spy×Family - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7              What is this?   Agent Twilight, the greatest spy for the nation of Westalis, has to infiltrate an elite private school. In order to do so he assumes the identity of psychiatrist Loid Forger, adopts an orphan girl, and marries a city hall employee. Unknown to him, his daughter Anya is a telepath and his wife Yor is an assassin. The three learn to become a family while working to complete Twilight's missions and maintain world peace. (from manga)   Spy×Family is based on Tatsuya Endō's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitin Moore  Rating:                As this season's Jump+ entry, SPY x FAMILY is easily the most anticipated series out of the three dozen or so series that have premiered over the last couple of weeks. And for once, I'm right here along with everyone else who was anticipating the heck out of it. That's because unlike most of the magazine's series that get turned into anime megahits, SPY x FAMILY's focus isn't primarily on fanservice, but on some of the most consistently funny, wholesome comedy in manga today.    I'm aware that as an American adult woman, I am well outside of SPY x FAMILY's target demographic, so please understand that I'm being tongue-in-cheek when I say this but: this series was made for me. Loid Forger is stunningly attractive both dressed up and dressed down, and doing his best to be a dad to Anya, who is melting his heart despite his attempts at retaining cold professionalism. Anya's psychic powers may get her out of scrapes and let her look smarter than she really is, but that doesn't make her overly precocious or sassy. When it comes to things other than giving correct answers, it's an accurate representation of how young children try to piece together meaning out of what they overhear from adults based on their limited understanding of the world. The two play off each other beautifully, and their relationship quickly becomes heartwarming as it becomes clear that Loid needs Anya not just as a spy on a mission, but as a person who is starved for human connection.    (Oh, and Yor isn't here yet but she's hot too and that's why SPY x FAMILY is bisexual culture.)    Unfortunately, it can be difficult to review comedy in a way that isn't just reciting the best jokes while I chuckle to myself, which is terribly unfunny to read so I'll spare you that pain and just encourage you to give it a shot, even if you're already familiar with the manga. I've always liked Kazuhiro Furuhashi as a director – I'm one of those weirdos who prefers the looser 1999 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter, which Furuhashi helmed, to 2011's shot-for-shot remake of the manga – and here he serves the source material well, with a consistent sense of comic timing to perfectly deliver each joke.    If you only watch one anime this season… pick the series that sounds most interesting to you, because taste is subjective and we all have our own preferences. But if you're stymied by the selection, SPY x FAMILY is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser and a solid choice for almost everyone.       James Beckett  Rating:               Hot damn! That is how you handle an adaptation. I am woefully behind on the manga version of SPY x FAMILY, but when I read that first chapter a while back, it made a huge impression, compelling and entertaining as it was. An anime was practically inevitable, and hype for the series only grew when it was confirmed that Wit Studio would be handling the production (alongside CloverWorks, who admittedly have a spottier track record as of late). I don't think anyone was ever expecting this show to be anything less than very good, but I have good news for any of the doubters left out there: SPY x FAMILY isn't just “very good”, it's fan-freakin'-tastic.    The key to SPY x FAMILY's success is the strength of its foundations. A comedy-thriller about a stone-cold spy becoming the father figure of an impossibly cute child (who also happens to be a telepath) is just a kickass concept, no matter the medium, and author Tatsuya Endō takes advantage of every hilarious and heartwarming ounce of potential that he can squeeze from it. Twilight/“Loid” is a great protagonist for this story, because his complete detachment from his own emotions makes perfect sense given his dangerous occupation, but it also allows for some damned funny shenanigans to ensue once he gets roped into the absurdity of “Operation Strix”.    The breakout star of the show, though, is clearly going to be Anya, who is so utterly precious and delightful that SPY x FAMILY ought to be arrested for conspiracy to drive its tens of thousands of viewers into sweetness-induced comas. Other anime need to take note: This is how you write a smart and intelligent kid that still sounds and behaves like a reasonable approximation of a real human child. My favorite scenes of this premiere all came from Anya just being a little goofball despite her powers and her smarts, like when she inadvertently summons a hit squad to her new villa when she messes around with Twilight's spy gear.    Speaking of the hit squad, another thing that SPY x FAMILY has going for it are it's gorgeous production values. Wit and CloverWorks are clearly going for broke here, because some of the kickass action scenes that we get between Twilight and the bad guys are straight-up cinematic in their framing and fluidity. SPY x FAMILY is a comedy first, but it doesn't forget that a spy story damn well better have some thrills in it, if only because it makes the jokes and the drama that follow hit that much harder.    Ultimately, though, what won me over to SPY x FAMILY is its heart. This show is just so cute, you guys, and I can't handle it. When Twilight picked up Anya and told her how well she did after the entrance exams, and you see her beam with pride and love…I cried like a baby, okay? I'm an easy mark for stories like this already, and SPY x FAMILY makes it impossible to resist when it does everything it sets out to do so damned well. This show is adorable, funny, and cool as hell, and it shot straight to the top of my Must Watch List of the season, just like I knew it would.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               To call this show the most anticipated title of the season would be a bit of an understatement. The original manga is about as close as you can get to an instant mega-hit, having already broken 15 million copies in circulation before its anime has even aired. With the impossibly polished trailers and visuals released ahead of this premiere, you had a perfect recipe for hype. Thankfully, all that buildup was worth it, as SPY x FAMILY is easily the sharpest, slickest premiere of the season, and quite possibly the whole year.    Just pardon me for a moment while I gush about how good this show looks. The character designs do a beautiful job bringing the simple and expressive nature of Tatsuya Endō's art to life, while also looking perfect in motion. The storyboarding and direction are in a class of their own compared to anything else that's aired this season, channeling the thrill of a classic spy movie without ever feeling gimmicky. And the amount of expressive character animation, be it in action scenes or simple comedy bits, brings the cast to life wonderfully. Through the visuals alone, this is about as close to a dream adaptation as you can get. That's no easy task considering how wide a net the show casts in both tone and plot, bouncing between cute-as-hell family comedy and life-or-death action setpieces. But this episode manages to portray both with equal energy and impact.    Of course, looking good wouldn't salvage things if the story and characters weren't engaging, and that's where this series really shines. Twilight (now “Loid Forger”) is a perfect conduit for the mix of silly and serious spy shenanigans shown in this setting, acting the stone-faced straight man to his ludicrous mission while nonetheless taking it 1000% seriously. It makes Anya his perfect foil as she breaks through his stoic exterior, both with her telepathy and sheer dumbassery, and every moment we see them interact is hilarious, right up until things suddenly get emotional. This could very well have gotten by on just being a comedy about a spy dad failing to keep secrets from his adoptive daughter and letting hijinks ensue, but by the end of this episode you feel a genuine connection between Loid and his new daughter, even if he wouldn't admit it himself. That's the crack in his façade that really matters, and it gives a slick and confident premiere that little extra heart it needs to be outstanding.    Though that particular dichotomy is perhaps the biggest place where this premiere might lose folks. SPY x FAMILY operates in a very precarious space between a goofy comedy of coincidences and a serious spy thriller, where the result is a world that mostly runs on cartoon logic. But that balance is hard to nail down, and the introduction struggles with it the most, trying to pull genuine emotion out of a Master of Disguise-style spy and a girl who randomly has mind-reading powers. Ultimately the resolution of this episode is sweet and earnest enough to make that work, but I wouldn't blame anybody for scratching their head when the narration nonchalantly explains that Anya has superpowers. That's just how this world works, and you've got to be on board for that to get to the good stuff.    If, however, you can roll with this wacky take on the Cold War, this is a fantastic time that promises to be one of the highlights of the season. And if you're like me and already a devotee of the manga, then you can rest assured that this adaptation is in great hands so far.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Anya is a fantastic little character, isn't she? She is the heart and soul of this anime and it wouldn't work even half as well without her. The duality of her character is perfect. On one hand, she is very young—likely younger than the 6-year-old she claims to be. On the other, she is psychic and can read people's minds. The way these two halves collide is the core of both the drama and comedy of the series. Just because she can see what a person is thinking doesn't mean she is any smarter than any other girl her age. She thinks spies are like what she sees on TV and can't imagine the real danger that her new life now harbors.    Yet, despite all this, there is a legitimate connection between her and Twilight. At first, the spy has trouble connecting with the girl, simply planning to use her as cover for this latest operation and then discard her. But when he realizes that he was her as a child, abandoned and alone with no one to rely on, he knows that he can't simply abandon Anya—no matter if that is the tactically correct choice.

Police in a Pod can be interesting too.   Couple of Cockoos is from what I've heard more like KanoKari or Domestic girlfriend - a giant train crush that is fascinating too look at.      Back to top                  SHD    Joined: 05 Apr 2015 		    Posts: 1162       Posted: Fri Apr 08, 2022 9:05 am            Huh, really scratching my head at some of these choices. From what I've read of In the Clear Moonlit Dusk and A Sign of Affection, they are as bog-standard as they get, I really fail to see what makes them special. Yes, both have a ""twist"" on the formulas of their genre, except even those twists are old by now, and then they don't really do anything particularly interesting with them. The characters are boring and tropey, the relationships and conflicts are nothing we haven't seen before... yes, I know I'm probably not the target audience here, not being particularly enamored with the genres and tropes in question, but I really don't understand how these are any better than the million other pleasantly drawn shoujo romances that follow the exact same formulas as these and do it neither better nor worse.   Same with Nina the Starry Bride, it's like... why this one in particular? Yes, it's a pleasant manga I guess, if someone is into this genre, but what makes it more special than say, Itsuwari no Freya or Elia to totsukuni no ou or Boukoku no Marguerite (aka Princess Marguerite From The Ruined Country)? All of them do pretty much what Nina the Starry Bride does, and do it better.    Skip to Loafer is really fun though, I look forward to the anime adaptation.

Police in a Pod can be interesting too.   Couple of Cockoos is from what I've heard more like KanoKari or Domestic girlfriend - a giant train crush that is fascinating too look at.

From what I've read of In the Clear Moonlit Dusk and A Sign of Affection, they are as bog-standard as they get, I really fail to see what makes them special. Yes, both have a ""twist"" on the formulas of their genre, except even those twists are old by now, and then they don't really do anything particularly interesting with them. The characters are boring and tropey, the relationships and conflicts are nothing we haven't seen before... yes, I know I'm probably not the target audience here, not being particularly enamored with the genres and tropes in question, but I really don't understand how these are any better than the million other pleasantly drawn shoujo romances that follow the exact same formulas as these and do it neither better nor worse.   Same with Nina the Starry Bride, it's like... why this one in particular? Yes, it's a pleasant manga I guess, if someone is into this genre, but what makes it more special than say, Itsuwari no Freya or Elia to totsukuni no ou or Boukoku no Marguerite (aka Princess Marguerite From The Ruined Country)? All of them do pretty much what Nina the Starry Bride does, and do it better.    Skip to Loafer is really fun though, I look forward to the anime adaptation.

The characters are boring and tropey, the relationships and conflicts are nothing we haven't seen before... yes, I know I'm probably not the target audience here, not being particularly enamored with the genres and tropes in question, but I really don't understand how these are any better than the million other pleasantly drawn shoujo romances that follow the exact same formulas as these and do it neither better nor worse.   Same with Nina the Starry Bride, it's like... why this one in particular? Yes, it's a pleasant manga I guess, if someone is into this genre, but what makes it more special than say, Itsuwari no Freya or Elia to totsukuni no ou or Boukoku no Marguerite (aka Princess Marguerite From The Ruined Country)? All of them do pretty much what Nina the Starry Bride does, and do it better.    Skip to Loafer is really fun though, I look forward to the anime adaptation.

From what I've read of In the Clear Moonlit Dusk and A Sign of Affection, they are as bog-standard as they get, I really fail to see what makes them special. Yes, both have a ""twist"" on the formulas of their genre, except even those twists are old by now, and then they don't really do anything particularly interesting with them. The characters are boring and tropey, the relationships and conflicts are nothing we haven't seen before... yes, I know I'm probably not the target audience here, not being particularly enamored with the genres and tropes in question, but I really don't understand how these are any better than the million other pleasantly drawn shoujo romances that follow the exact same formulas as these and do it neither better nor worse.   Same with Nina the Starry Bride, it's like... why this one in particular? Yes, it's a pleasant manga I guess, if someone is into this genre, but what makes it more special than say, Itsuwari no Freya or Elia to totsukuni no ou or Boukoku no Marguerite (aka Princess Marguerite From The Ruined Country)? All of them do pretty much what Nina the Starry Bride does, and do it better.    Skip to Loafer is really fun though, I look forward to the anime adaptation.

Like them missing something or not being the first on it is fine it happens all the time (its why I prefer animecorner most of time) but there's a limit to when that stops being fine and it just becomes embarrassing and pointless few weeks fine, year old news...its just a joke.   Its not like the article highlights or adds anything new since more than half is them just coping and pasting the SAG-AFTRA blog post to begin with.

Where did any of us say please lie or pretend it was current ? All we are discussing is why you felt the need to source a year old do not work notice and create a whole article about it when there hasn't been an update or new information seems pointless given the case.   Also your point linking to the current active discussions around pay for English dubs in the US also doesn't make much sense since its just a single sentence slapped on the bottom of the article and Ocean is a Canadian production company...   Like if you want to keep highlighting that discussion around pay then fair play please do, but at least try and use current sources.

It just seemed a bit odd to me since there wasn't any of the follow-up that I would have expected given that the original press release was a year ago. Normally I would assume that if something like this is being posted its because there is new information released that was not previously announced or well known.    While the information on its own is interesting given the merger, I think it might help in the future if such information was appended by the note that as such there has still not been a dub announced in English so that people don't think that this is in response to a completely non-union team being announced.

I did consider it embarrassing since this is a pretty big deal but it wouldn't have been my departments that wrote it up when it was current and now it's probably considered too old for news. However, I still think it's important enough that it should have been acknowledged at the time so that, and given the current movement going on within the professional dub community, I asked one of our writers to post something. At least now if something does change there's a paper trail for it.

Canada used to dub anime more frequently,but that pretty much phased out after the 2000's(with a few exceptions).  Boy,if,as an answer to the voice-actors from California and Texas asking for a raise,companies start to dub more anime in english in places like Japan(see Resident Evil 1,Castlevania Symphony of The Night,Mega Man 8,mega Man X4,Shenmue 1 and 2,House of The Dead,and etc. as examples),Hong Kong,Singapure(where most of the anime broadcasted on Animax in Asia get dubbed in English) or Miami(see the initial dub of AICO The Incarnation and season 1 of Gintama),it's going to be a disaster...

Like them missing something or not being the first on it is fine it happens all the time (its why I prefer animecorner most of time) but there's a limit to when that stops being fine and it just becomes embarrassing and pointless few weeks fine, year old news...its just a joke.   Its not like the article highlights or adds anything new since more than half is them just coping and pasting the SAG-AFTRA blog post to begin with.

Where did any of us say please lie or pretend it was current ? All we are discussing is why you felt the need to source a year old do not work notice and create a whole article about it when there hasn't been an update or new information seems pointless given the case.   Also your point linking to the current active discussions around pay for English dubs in the US also doesn't make much sense since its just a single sentence slapped on the bottom of the article and Ocean is a Canadian production company...   Like if you want to keep highlighting that discussion around pay then fair play please do, but at least try and use current sources.

Might be worth talking about if the notice is still in effect or anything.    Or at least put the ""last year"" bit in the title, since you know a ton of people will share it without reading the article.

It just seemed a bit odd to me since there wasn't any of the follow-up that I would have expected given that the original press release was a year ago. Normally I would assume that if something like this is being posted its because there is new information released that was not previously announced or well known.    While the information on its own is interesting given the merger, I think it might help in the future if such information was appended by the note that as such there has still not been a dub announced in English so that people don't think that this is in response to a completely non-union team being announced.

I did consider it embarrassing since this is a pretty big deal but it wouldn't have been my departments that wrote it up when it was current and now it's probably considered too old for news. However, I still think it's important enough that it should have been acknowledged at the time so that, and given the current movement going on within the professional dub community, I asked one of our writers to post something. At least now if something does change there's a paper trail for it.

Canada used to dub anime more frequently,but that pretty much phased out after the 2000's(with a few exceptions).  Boy,if,as an answer to the voice-actors from California and Texas asking for a raise,companies start to dub more anime in english in places like Japan(see Resident Evil 1,Castlevania Symphony of The Night,Mega Man 8,mega Man X4,Shenmue 1 and 2,House of The Dead,and etc. as examples),Hong Kong,Singapure(where most of the anime broadcasted on Animax in Asia get dubbed in English) or Miami(see the initial dub of AICO The Incarnation and season 1 of Gintama),it's going to be a disaster...

Like them missing something or not being the first on it is fine it happens all the time (its why I prefer animecorner most of time) but there's a limit to when that stops being fine and it just becomes embarrassing and pointless few weeks fine, year old news...its just a joke.   Its not like the article highlights or adds anything new since more than half is them just coping and pasting the SAG-AFTRA blog post to begin with.

Where did any of us say please lie or pretend it was current ? All we are discussing is why you felt the need to source a year old do not work notice and create a whole article about it when there hasn't been an update or new information seems pointless given the case.   Also your point linking to the current active discussions around pay for English dubs in the US also doesn't make much sense since its just a single sentence slapped on the bottom of the article and Ocean is a Canadian production company...   Like if you want to keep highlighting that discussion around pay then fair play please do, but at least try and use current sources.

Might be worth talking about if the notice is still in effect or anything.    Or at least put the ""last year"" bit in the title, since you know a ton of people will share it without reading the article.

It just seemed a bit odd to me since there wasn't any of the follow-up that I would have expected given that the original press release was a year ago. Normally I would assume that if something like this is being posted its because there is new information released that was not previously announced or well known.    While the information on its own is interesting given the merger, I think it might help in the future if such information was appended by the note that as such there has still not been a dub announced in English so that people don't think that this is in response to a completely non-union team being announced.

I did consider it embarrassing since this is a pretty big deal but it wouldn't have been my departments that wrote it up when it was current and now it's probably considered too old for news. However, I still think it's important enough that it should have been acknowledged at the time so that, and given the current movement going on within the professional dub community, I asked one of our writers to post something. At least now if something does change there's a paper trail for it.

Canada used to dub anime more frequently,but that pretty much phased out after the 2000's(with a few exceptions).  Boy,if,as an answer to the voice-actors from California and Texas asking for a raise,companies start to dub more anime in english in places like Japan(see Resident Evil 1,Castlevania Symphony of The Night,Mega Man 8,mega Man X4,Shenmue 1 and 2,House of The Dead,and etc. as examples),Hong Kong,Singapure(where most of the anime broadcasted on Animax in Asia get dubbed in English) or Miami(see the initial dub of AICO The Incarnation and season 1 of Gintama),it's going to be a disaster...

Where did any of us say please lie or pretend it was current ? All we are discussing is why you felt the need to source a year old do not work notice and create a whole article about it when there hasn't been an update or new information seems pointless given the case.   Also your point linking to the current active discussions around pay for English dubs in the US also doesn't make much sense since its just a single sentence slapped on the bottom of the article and Ocean is a Canadian production company...   Like if you want to keep highlighting that discussion around pay then fair play please do, but at least try and use current sources.

Its not like the article highlights or adds anything new since more than half is them just coping and pasting the SAG-AFTRA blog post to begin with.

Where did any of us say please lie or pretend it was current ? All we are discussing is why you felt the need to source a year old do not work notice and create a whole article about it when there hasn't been an update or new information seems pointless given the case.   Also your point linking to the current active discussions around pay for English dubs in the US also doesn't make much sense since its just a single sentence slapped on the bottom of the article and Ocean is a Canadian production company...   Like if you want to keep highlighting that discussion around pay then fair play please do, but at least try and use current sources.

It just seemed a bit odd to me since there wasn't any of the follow-up that I would have expected given that the original press release was a year ago.

While the information on its own is interesting given the merger, I think it might help in the future if such information was appended by the note that as such there has still not been a dub announced in English so that people don't think that this is in response to a completely non-union team being announced.

I did consider it embarrassing since this is a pretty big deal but it wouldn't have been my departments that wrote it up when it was current and now it's probably considered too old for news. However, I still think it's important enough that it should have been acknowledged at the time so that, and given the current movement going on within the professional dub community, I asked one of our writers to post something. At least now if something does change there's a paper trail for it.

All we are discussing is why you felt the need to source a year old do not work notice and create a whole article about it when there hasn't been an update or new information seems pointless given the case.   Also your point linking to the current active discussions around pay for English dubs in the US also doesn't make much sense since its just a single sentence slapped on the bottom of the article and Ocean is a Canadian production company...

It just seemed a bit odd to me since there wasn't any of the follow-up that I would have expected given that the original press release was a year ago. Normally I would assume that if something like this is being posted its because there is new information released that was not previously announced or well known.    While the information on its own is interesting given the merger, I think it might help in the future if such information was appended by the note that as such there has still not been a dub announced in English so that people don't think that this is in response to a completely non-union team being announced.

I did consider it embarrassing since this is a pretty big deal but it wouldn't have been my departments that wrote it up when it was current and now it's probably considered too old for news. However, I still think it's important enough that it should have been acknowledged at the time so that, and given the current movement going on within the professional dub community, I asked one of our writers to post something. At least now if something does change there's a paper trail for it.

Where did any of us say please lie or pretend it was current ? All we are discussing is why you felt the need to source a year old do not work notice and create a whole article about it when there hasn't been an update or new information seems pointless given the case.   Also your point linking to the current active discussions around pay for English dubs in the US also doesn't make much sense since its just a single sentence slapped on the bottom of the article and Ocean is a Canadian production company...   Like if you want to keep highlighting that discussion around pay then fair play please do, but at least try and use current sources.

It just seemed a bit odd to me since there wasn't any of the follow-up that I would have expected given that the original press release was a year ago. Normally I would assume that if something like this is being posted its because there is new information released that was not previously announced or well known.    While the information on its own is interesting given the merger, I think it might help in the future if such information was appended by the note that as such there has still not been a dub announced in English so that people don't think that this is in response to a completely non-union team being announced.

You can presume it is as nothing has changed since.     DamianSalazar wrote:    I remember seeing in a comment section about a week ago that mentioned this topic. I also remember one of the head editors of this site asking the user who brought up this topic for more details. It seemed like this slipped past ANN, a bit embarrassing because it's news from familiar territory (North America).            Yeah that was me. I did consider it embarrassing since this is a pretty big deal but it wouldn't have been my departments that wrote it up when it was current and now it's probably considered too old for news. However, I still think it's important enough that it should have been acknowledged at the time so that, and given the current movement going on within the professional dub community, I asked one of our writers to post something. At least now if something does change there's a paper trail for it.
