Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 Episode 24  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of The Case Study of Vanitas (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5            If you needed a reason not to trust cats, this episode might give it to you. Nothing is explicitly stated, but there's an impressively strong implication that Murr, the grumpy fuzzball who has accompanied Noé this whole time, is actually his teacher, Dominique and Louis' grandfather, and Marquis de Sade himself. Although he says that the form Vanitas has met him in before is that of the Comte de Saint Germaine, there's plenty to indicate that he's holding back a very important truth, which we see in three main ways: his eyes are the same colors as Murr's, he calls everyone “kittens,” and in the last scene we see of Murr, he's walking with a black kitten wearing a blue ribbon…after Monsieur le Comte has taken Mikhaïl away with him.    Yes, Mikhaïl turns up again in battered human form to make one last plea for Vanitas to join him, and yes, “mes chatons” isn't outside the realm of possibility for a vaguely unsettling pet name, but it makes so much sense if he's actually Murr. He has to have been following Vanitas' and Noé's every move to step in when he does, influencing them in subtle ways to steer them to the moment of confrontation with Mikhaïl, or at least making sure that they didn't do something silly like die before his plans come to fruition. Whether or not he's been counting on our heroes forming a bond is up in the air, but if he was, he seems to have known Vanitas better than Vanitas knows himself. It's clear that he's playing a long game, even if his true goal remains uncertain.    But if this final confrontation does anything apart from solidifying Noé's and Vanitas' relationship, that would be to finally make Vanitas start moving forward again. The best symbolism of that is in the final ending theme, where rather than stopping to look back, Vanitas keeps moving forward down the beach with Noé, indicating that he has at long last put the past behind him. His hourglass earring also plays a role, as it has this entire season; the close focus on it when Vanitas explains to Mikhaïl that the dead cannot come back is indicative of the fact that he knows that Luna's time has run out. He can't just flip over the hourglass and bring them back, and perhaps keeping the hourglass charm was his way of remembering that. Time comes for us all, and if Vanitas has been devoted to preventing it from running out of curse-bearers' glasses too fast, he does that because of the one whose time ran out too soon. He doesn't have the childish optimism of Mikhaïl. Instead he's been stuck in anger and regret, and it was Noé and Jeanne who helped him out of it, making him feel things he'd relegated to a box in the corner of his heart. It's not that his goal has changed, but rather that he's got a clearer view of it now, and when he takes Noé's hand in the end, that's him accepting that he has to keep moving forward.    Dominique has a similar moment of self-realization when she's stuck in the greyscale confines of her own mind. She could easily have become another Mikhaïl, but instead she makes the choice to finally take a step out of the past. She's back in mourning when we catch a glimpse of her in the dining room with Jeanne, but maybe this time she'll come out of it naturally, as herself rather than as someone who thinks she needs to give her dead twin's life meaning by living for and as him. Domi deserves to be happy, to have people she loves as herself, and to be her own person. As a child she couldn't process Louis' death; as an adult, and with the help of those who love her, she may be able to start living again – as Dominique de Sade rather than as a shadow of her brother.    Do I wish there was more? Yes, of course, but we've caught up with the manga now and I'd rather wait years for a third season that could follow it as faithfully, because this has been both an extraordinarily good adaptation and a strong story that I want to see continue as the author wrote it. For now the sun has risen after the rain and we can feel secure that Noé, Vanitas, Jeanne, and Domi will all keep moving forward. It's a good place to stop – especially since we know that the story is far from over.

Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 Episode 24  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of The Case Study of Vanitas (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5            If you needed a reason not to trust cats, this episode might give it to you. Nothing is explicitly stated, but there's an impressively strong implication that Murr, the grumpy fuzzball who has accompanied Noé this whole time, is actually his teacher, Dominique and Louis' grandfather, and Marquis de Sade himself. Although he says that the form Vanitas has met him in before is that of the Comte de Saint Germaine, there's plenty to indicate that he's holding back a very important truth, which we see in three main ways: his eyes are the same colors as Murr's, he calls everyone “kittens,” and in the last scene we see of Murr, he's walking with a black kitten wearing a blue ribbon…after Monsieur le Comte has taken Mikhaïl away with him.    Yes, Mikhaïl turns up again in battered human form to make one last plea for Vanitas to join him, and yes, “mes chatons” isn't outside the realm of possibility for a vaguely unsettling pet name, but it makes so much sense if he's actually Murr. He has to have been following Vanitas' and Noé's every move to step in when he does, influencing them in subtle ways to steer them to the moment of confrontation with Mikhaïl, or at least making sure that they didn't do something silly like die before his plans come to fruition. Whether or not he's been counting on our heroes forming a bond is up in the air, but if he was, he seems to have known Vanitas better than Vanitas knows himself. It's clear that he's playing a long game, even if his true goal remains uncertain.    But if this final confrontation does anything apart from solidifying Noé's and Vanitas' relationship, that would be to finally make Vanitas start moving forward again. The best symbolism of that is in the final ending theme, where rather than stopping to look back, Vanitas keeps moving forward down the beach with Noé, indicating that he has at long last put the past behind him. His hourglass earring also plays a role, as it has this entire season; the close focus on it when Vanitas explains to Mikhaïl that the dead cannot come back is indicative of the fact that he knows that Luna's time has run out. He can't just flip over the hourglass and bring them back, and perhaps keeping the hourglass charm was his way of remembering that. Time comes for us all, and if Vanitas has been devoted to preventing it from running out of curse-bearers' glasses too fast, he does that because of the one whose time ran out too soon. He doesn't have the childish optimism of Mikhaïl. Instead he's been stuck in anger and regret, and it was Noé and Jeanne who helped him out of it, making him feel things he'd relegated to a box in the corner of his heart. It's not that his goal has changed, but rather that he's got a clearer view of it now, and when he takes Noé's hand in the end, that's him accepting that he has to keep moving forward.    Dominique has a similar moment of self-realization when she's stuck in the greyscale confines of her own mind. She could easily have become another Mikhaïl, but instead she makes the choice to finally take a step out of the past. She's back in mourning when we catch a glimpse of her in the dining room with Jeanne, but maybe this time she'll come out of it naturally, as herself rather than as someone who thinks she needs to give her dead twin's life meaning by living for and as him. Domi deserves to be happy, to have people she loves as herself, and to be her own person. As a child she couldn't process Louis' death; as an adult, and with the help of those who love her, she may be able to start living again – as Dominique de Sade rather than as a shadow of her brother.    Do I wish there was more? Yes, of course, but we've caught up with the manga now and I'd rather wait years for a third season that could follow it as faithfully, because this has been both an extraordinarily good adaptation and a strong story that I want to see continue as the author wrote it. For now the sun has risen after the rain and we can feel secure that Noé, Vanitas, Jeanne, and Domi will all keep moving forward. It's a good place to stop – especially since we know that the story is far from over.

Yes, Mikhaïl turns up again in battered human form to make one last plea for Vanitas to join him, and yes, “mes chatons” isn't outside the realm of possibility for a vaguely unsettling pet name, but it makes so much sense if he's actually Murr. He has to have been following Vanitas' and Noé's every move to step in when he does, influencing them in subtle ways to steer them to the moment of confrontation with Mikhaïl, or at least making sure that they didn't do something silly like die before his plans come to fruition. Whether or not he's been counting on our heroes forming a bond is up in the air, but if he was, he seems to have known Vanitas better than Vanitas knows himself. It's clear that he's playing a long game, even if his true goal remains uncertain.    But if this final confrontation does anything apart from solidifying Noé's and Vanitas' relationship, that would be to finally make Vanitas start moving forward again. The best symbolism of that is in the final ending theme, where rather than stopping to look back, Vanitas keeps moving forward down the beach with Noé, indicating that he has at long last put the past behind him. His hourglass earring also plays a role, as it has this entire season; the close focus on it when Vanitas explains to Mikhaïl that the dead cannot come back is indicative of the fact that he knows that Luna's time has run out. He can't just flip over the hourglass and bring them back, and perhaps keeping the hourglass charm was his way of remembering that. Time comes for us all, and if Vanitas has been devoted to preventing it from running out of curse-bearers' glasses too fast, he does that because of the one whose time ran out too soon. He doesn't have the childish optimism of Mikhaïl. Instead he's been stuck in anger and regret, and it was Noé and Jeanne who helped him out of it, making him feel things he'd relegated to a box in the corner of his heart. It's not that his goal has changed, but rather that he's got a clearer view of it now, and when he takes Noé's hand in the end, that's him accepting that he has to keep moving forward.    Dominique has a similar moment of self-realization when she's stuck in the greyscale confines of her own mind. She could easily have become another Mikhaïl, but instead she makes the choice to finally take a step out of the past. She's back in mourning when we catch a glimpse of her in the dining room with Jeanne, but maybe this time she'll come out of it naturally, as herself rather than as someone who thinks she needs to give her dead twin's life meaning by living for and as him. Domi deserves to be happy, to have people she loves as herself, and to be her own person. As a child she couldn't process Louis' death; as an adult, and with the help of those who love her, she may be able to start living again – as Dominique de Sade rather than as a shadow of her brother.    Do I wish there was more? Yes, of course, but we've caught up with the manga now and I'd rather wait years for a third season that could follow it as faithfully, because this has been both an extraordinarily good adaptation and a strong story that I want to see continue as the author wrote it. For now the sun has risen after the rain and we can feel secure that Noé, Vanitas, Jeanne, and Domi will all keep moving forward. It's a good place to stop – especially since we know that the story is far from over.

Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 Episode 24  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of The Case Study of Vanitas (TV 2) ?

I followed the Japanese version as it aired. It’ll be good to hear Tony Oliver and company do their turn next. I just hope it doesn’t mean the disc release isn’t next year or later. It took Part 5 forever to come out on Blu-Ray.    It’s too bad Lupin doesn’t get good ratings on Toonami, though. I blame unsophisticated viewers.

Toonami’s broadcast of shows does not delay the Blu-ray. While it’s true that there was an entire year of waiting for Toonami to air Part V but that has more to do with the Dub taking so long. Toonami does often have the power to air the Dubs before Streaming services do, but they don’t have the power to alter when the Blu-ray will be released. You could say that Toonami airs the series during the time companies like Discotek, Sentai, etc. haven’t got the okay to release the Blu-ray yet from the Japanese Production companies.

Because who the hell even watches Naruto any more, iv closed the book on that many years ago. I think it has over stayed its welcome. You can say the same for cowboy bebop but since the live action, it sort of sparked the popularity under that show again so that is why its more relevant these days. But naruto needs to go.

Have to remember that Shippuden started in 2014 on Toonami and yet hasn’t finished yet because of how long it is. They want their money’s worth out of it. Cowboy Bebop has just been a staple for Adult Swim’s go to series that they can air as much as they want without some big cost to license it.

I’m all for that as long as Viz allows the dub to finally stream in its entirety on a service available in both US and Canada. As it stands, the choices are either to A) watch Shippuden weekly on Toonami for the next who knows how many years (while maintaining an expensive cable subscription), B) buy the Dvds for something like $1000 (or digital episodes on Microsoft or Amazon video, but it’s almost the same price), C) get a UK VPN and watch it on Funimation, or D) pirate.

While I was always amused by Lupin, it didn't really ""click"" with me until Parts 4 and 5. Part 6 looked really intriguing. I am Team Tony Oliver and Richard Epcar, so no complaints on that front if it's the LA crew.   I'm still checking out Shippuden, as I never finished it, and Toonami's a fun way to watch it.   As for Psycho-Pass, if a Toonami run could get the undubbed material dubbed, it'd be worth it.

I followed the Japanese version as it aired. It’ll be good to hear Tony Oliver and company do their turn next. I just hope it doesn’t mean the disc release isn’t next year or later. It took Part 5 forever to come out on Blu-Ray.    It’s too bad Lupin doesn’t get good ratings on Toonami, though. I blame unsophisticated viewers.

Toonami’s broadcast of shows does not delay the Blu-ray. While it’s true that there was an entire year of waiting for Toonami to air Part V but that has more to do with the Dub taking so long. Toonami does often have the power to air the Dubs before Streaming services do, but they don’t have the power to alter when the Blu-ray will be released. You could say that Toonami airs the series during the time companies like Discotek, Sentai, etc. haven’t got the okay to release the Blu-ray yet from the Japanese Production companies.

Because who the hell even watches Naruto any more, iv closed the book on that many years ago. I think it has over stayed its welcome. You can say the same for cowboy bebop but since the live action, it sort of sparked the popularity under that show again so that is why its more relevant these days. But naruto needs to go.

But naruto needs to go.            Shippuden will leave once Toonami airs the final episode of it. Have to remember that Shippuden started in 2014 on Toonami and yet hasn’t finished yet because of how long it is. They want their money’s worth out of it. Cowboy Bebop has just been a staple for Adult Swim’s go to series that they can air as much as they want without some big cost to license it.

I’m all for that as long as Viz allows the dub to finally stream in its entirety on a service available in both US and Canada. As it stands, the choices are either to A) watch Shippuden weekly on Toonami for the next who knows how many years (while maintaining an expensive cable subscription), B) buy the Dvds for something like $1000 (or digital episodes on Microsoft or Amazon video, but it’s almost the same price), C) get a UK VPN and watch it on Funimation, or D) pirate.

Funimation did something like that in that Dragonball Super filler episode with the Ocean Group Vegeta voice being the villain Vegeta fighting against Sabat’s Vegeta.

While I was always amused by Lupin, it didn't really ""click"" with me until Parts 4 and 5. Part 6 looked really intriguing. I am Team Tony Oliver and Richard Epcar, so no complaints on that front if it's the LA crew.   I'm still checking out Shippuden, as I never finished it, and Toonami's a fun way to watch it.   As for Psycho-Pass, if a Toonami run could get the undubbed material dubbed, it'd be worth it.

I followed the Japanese version as it aired. It’ll be good to hear Tony Oliver and company do their turn next. I just hope it doesn’t mean the disc release isn’t next year or later. It took Part 5 forever to come out on Blu-Ray.    It’s too bad Lupin doesn’t get good ratings on Toonami, though. I blame unsophisticated viewers.

Toonami’s broadcast of shows does not delay the Blu-ray. While it’s true that there was an entire year of waiting for Toonami to air Part V but that has more to do with the Dub taking so long. Toonami does often have the power to air the Dubs before Streaming services do, but they don’t have the power to alter when the Blu-ray will be released. You could say that Toonami airs the series during the time companies like Discotek, Sentai, etc. haven’t got the okay to release the Blu-ray yet from the Japanese Production companies.

Because who the hell even watches Naruto any more, iv closed the book on that many years ago. I think it has over stayed its welcome. You can say the same for cowboy bebop but since the live action, it sort of sparked the popularity under that show again so that is why its more relevant these days. But naruto needs to go.

Have to remember that Shippuden started in 2014 on Toonami and yet hasn’t finished yet because of how long it is. They want their money’s worth out of it. Cowboy Bebop has just been a staple for Adult Swim’s go to series that they can air as much as they want without some big cost to license it.

I’m all for that as long as Viz allows the dub to finally stream in its entirety on a service available in both US and Canada. As it stands, the choices are either to A) watch Shippuden weekly on Toonami for the next who knows how many years (while maintaining an expensive cable subscription), B) buy the Dvds for something like $1000 (or digital episodes on Microsoft or Amazon video, but it’s almost the same price), C) get a UK VPN and watch it on Funimation, or D) pirate.

While I was always amused by Lupin, it didn't really ""click"" with me until Parts 4 and 5. Part 6 looked really intriguing. I am Team Tony Oliver and Richard Epcar, so no complaints on that front if it's the LA crew.   I'm still checking out Shippuden, as I never finished it, and Toonami's a fun way to watch it.   As for Psycho-Pass, if a Toonami run could get the undubbed material dubbed, it'd be worth it.

Because who the hell even watches Naruto any more, iv closed the book on that many years ago. I think it has over stayed its welcome. You can say the same for cowboy bebop but since the live action, it sort of sparked the popularity under that show again so that is why its more relevant these days. But naruto needs to go.

Have to remember that Shippuden started in 2014 on Toonami and yet hasn’t finished yet because of how long it is. They want their money’s worth out of it. Cowboy Bebop has just been a staple for Adult Swim’s go to series that they can air as much as they want without some big cost to license it.

I’m all for that as long as Viz allows the dub to finally stream in its entirety on a service available in both US and Canada. As it stands, the choices are either to A) watch Shippuden weekly on Toonami for the next who knows how many years (while maintaining an expensive cable subscription), B) buy the Dvds for something like $1000 (or digital episodes on Microsoft or Amazon video, but it’s almost the same price), C) get a UK VPN and watch it on Funimation, or D) pirate.

While I was always amused by Lupin, it didn't really ""click"" with me until Parts 4 and 5. Part 6 looked really intriguing. I am Team Tony Oliver and Richard Epcar, so no complaints on that front if it's the LA crew.   I'm still checking out Shippuden, as I never finished it, and Toonami's a fun way to watch it.   As for Psycho-Pass, if a Toonami run could get the undubbed material dubbed, it'd be worth it.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (249 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          14 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr 10, 07:52 14 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (249 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          14 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr 10, 07:52 14 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (249 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          14 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr 10, 07:52 14 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (249 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.

The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving.

There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.

Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic ?                     Community score: 4.6              What is this?   Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are two geniuses who stand atop their prestigious academy's student council, making them the elite among elite. But it's lonely at the top and each has fallen for the other. There's just one huge problem standing in the way of lovey-dovey bliss—they're both too prideful to be the first to confess their romantic feelings and thus become the “loser” in the competition of love.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic is the latest entry in the television anime based on Aka Akasaka's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I can't believe that in one day, two of my favorite romances had new seasons start! Premiere season is tough, but days like this make it worth it. Kaguya-sama: Love is War has returned for a third season, picking right back where the previous season left off, and boy, am I glad to see these kids with all their weird little quirks and foibles again.    I wasn't totally sold on Miko Iino by the end of the previous season, unsure of where she would fit into the group dynamic with rigid prudishness as her primary character trait. So of course, the episode leads with a skit between her and Ishigami, who once upon a time was one of the worst characters but is now one of the best. Miko's strange listening habits, and Ishigami's attempt at taking the fall for her, made her feel more like a little weirdo, and by now, a bit of weirdness is basically a requirement to be a student council member.    This is important because there's a playfulness inherent to Kaguya-sama that Iino's rigidity seemed antithetical to, but ended up on full display for the rest of the episode. Teenagers aren't my area of expertise, but they're still kids, and kids need to play! They need to be awkward and obsess over things like read receipts on messaging apps and boast and set up arm-wrestling tournaments instead of doing their actual work. Their personalities are exaggerated and caricatured, but few comedies capture those special moments where you get a strange idea and just keep going with it.    That playfulness extends to the visual presentation as well. The animation in this season has so far been fairly middle of the road, and thus I haven't commented on it much, but Kaguya-sama has some of the best goddamn direction and animation in the medium. Mamoru Hatakeyama and his team almost always manage to elevate the manga's punchlines into something special, and they held nothing back this episode. From the camel wandering around in the background as Iino studies, to Shirogane's shifting body language as he realizes he has the upper hand on Kaguya over the phone, to making the picture quality look like a VHS transfer – every frame has something joyful and unexpected. Big gags and subtle expressions alike have been animated with equal levels of care.    If you haven't watched Kaguya-sama: Love is War yet… why not? It's seriously one of the best anime comedies ever made. Why deprive yourself?       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               After having watched two full seasons, it's become perfectly clear that Kaguya-sama isn't for me (except in the rare cases where it is). Being mostly a series of short gags—usually involving instant karma as one of the student council members attempts to assert dominance over the others in some way—means that there's not much to further develop the characters or progress the love story between Shinomiya and Shirogane. The episodes of the series I most enjoy tend to be the final few of the season where meaningful things happen and there is real drama and tangible stakes. This season premiere was most certainly not one of those episodes.    Now, that's not to say I don't find the humor of the show funny in its own right. From Ishigami futilely trying to stop Iino from embarrassing herself to Shinomiya's ignorance about the differences between email and texting, there are a ton of great gags in this episode. The final self-contained story about the arm wrestling tournament takes things to a whole other level—especially with its post-credits scene showing that Fujiwara was just talking trash the whole time and couldn't win without cheating.    But what takes all these gags to the next level is the animation that merges what's really going on with what the characters are thinking to create something as funny as it is surreal. From the large camel making noises in Iino's ear to the mountain of bodybuilders supporting Shinomiya, it's all but impossible not to laugh.    So while Kaguya-sama isn't my cup of tea in general, I wouldn't say that this is a bad episode. In fact, it is pretty much the epitome of what Kaguya-sama is at its essence. If you ever need a laugh, Kaguya-sama is eager to deliver—just don't expect anything more.       James Beckett  Rating:               One of the “benefits” of being a teacher is getting to essentially serve as a kind of covert anthropologist that specializes in that most elusive and influential of species: The modern teenager. I'm like Jane Goodall; I live among them, in their native environment, and since they give absolutely zero shits about what I think, I have free reign to study the peculiar social rituals and developmental adaptations that these hormonal and aggressive pack animals undergo. As such, I feel like I can say, with legitimately authoritative expertise, that one of the things that makes Kaguya-sama: Love is War such a smashing success is how well it understands the interior lives of teenagers. Specifically, it has a comprehensive understanding of all the ridiculously dumb shit that teenagers will do to and with one another when left to their own devices. More importantly, it gets that all of this inane tomfoolery, no matter how stupid, will feel to a teenager like the most earth-shatteringly consequential events that will ever occur in their lifetimes.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War –Ultra Romantic– is essentially more of the same, in that regard. The goofy kids of Shuchiin Academy's student council spend their days getting into the most ridiculous of shenanigans, while Kaguya and Miyuki sloooooooowly progress along their romantic destinies with one another. “More of the same” can come across as a backhanded compliment, but that couldn't be further from the truth in the case of an anime like Kaguya-sama, considering that the “same” in question happens to be some of the most consistently hilarious and expertly animated comedy in the business.    Each of the three sketches in this premiere does what Kaguya-sama does best, in that they take painfully relatable, everyday scenarios and crank the intensity so far past the eleven mark that the the dial may as well be ripped clean off. The opening sketch is perhaps the weakest of the three, since it focuses on Yu trying to deal with Miko not realizing that people can hear the weird crap she listens to when she's studying, and neither of these characters are the strongest of the ensemble. The joke about Miko's weird listening habits is also just not terribly funny, though that might be because that my own ADHD has had me go to some truly strange and avant garde places in search of distracting sounds to play when I'm trying to focus.    The other two scenes are golden, though, and they show off a wide variety of Kaguya-sama's strengths. The “Read Receipts” sketch is a masterpiece of observational humor, mining Kaguya's technological naivety and featuring Miyuki in full-on petty-goblin mode. It's one of those bits where the show manages to generate horror movie levels of tension on behalf of these loveably awkward children and their inability to just have a normal conversation. We also get a lot of good Ai content, which is always a bonus.    The “Arm Wrestling” sketch is just as hilarious, mostly because it's one of those showcases that gets the whole cast in on a silly mess-around that allows the artists at A-1 Pictures to really strut their stuff. It would already have been funny to have Chika get so obsessed with putting on an arm- wrestling contest, but Kaguya-sama goes the extra mile by animating the ever-loving hell out of it all. I demand a raise specifically for whoever got to handle the cut where Miyuki's face nearly implodes against the fury of Kaguya's sweat-hands fury (we've all been there, girl, there's no shame in it).    Do you honestly need me to tell you that Kaguya-sama's third season is mandatory viewing for this spring? Of course not. It's proven itself time and time again. Still, in case it needs to be said: Yes, the show is great, and you should absolutely watch it. Duh-doy, Britta.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There really is nothing else quite like Kaguya-sama is there? Even as a self-proclaimed connoisseur of romcoms, it's hard to think of another series that managed to take such a simple premise and spin it into one of the most infectiously hilarious – and consistent – anime comedies of the past decade. But whatever alchemy is happening between the source material and the always exuberant adaptation team is still firing on all cylinders, and they've come back from season two without missing a step.    The series isn't resting on its laurels for this sequel either. It'd be easy to throw us back in with a classic Kaguya vs Shirogane battle, but instead they used the opportunity to demonstrate just how much good the previous season did for the show's weakest characters. Not only are Ishigami and Iino capable of carrying a skit almost entirely on their own, but they're able to do it in a way that capitalizes on all of  Ishigami's growth from the previous arc, going from the show's go-to punching bag to the kind of selfless idiot-genius that butters this show's bread. It's an unconventional way to welcome viewers back, but nonetheless promises to be just as hilarious as always.    From there, it's the same Kaguya-sama that steamrolled through our hearts in the previous seasons. The characters are still a blast, and the direction is as committed as ever to ridiculous, eclectic, and endlessly creative visual gags to sell every joke. It's not doing anything particularly new for the series, but that's a “don't mess with perfection” situation if ever there was one. I can attest to having a stupid smile plastered on my face across the entire premiere, and I busted out laughing as these kids tried to Death Note their way through being left on read, or when an homage to the soundtrack of Over The Top started playing during their arm-wrestling tournament. It's the kind of layered, high-effort joke that sets this show apart from the rest of its subgenre, and it's just so nice to have it back.    If you've missed this runaway train of a show, there probably aren't enough creatively directed romantic mind games in the world to convince you at this point. But if you're already a fan who was just worried the magic might have run out after all this time, you've got nothing to worry about. Kaguya-sama is back and in championship form once again.     discuss this in the forum (249 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          14 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr 10, 07:52 14 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

There's just one huge problem standing in the way of lovey-dovey bliss—they're both too prideful to be the first to confess their romantic feelings and thus become the “loser” in the competition of love.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic is the latest entry in the television anime based on Aka Akasaka's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I can't believe that in one day, two of my favorite romances had new seasons start! Premiere season is tough, but days like this make it worth it. Kaguya-sama: Love is War has returned for a third season, picking right back where the previous season left off, and boy, am I glad to see these kids with all their weird little quirks and foibles again.    I wasn't totally sold on Miko Iino by the end of the previous season, unsure of where she would fit into the group dynamic with rigid prudishness as her primary character trait. So of course, the episode leads with a skit between her and Ishigami, who once upon a time was one of the worst characters but is now one of the best. Miko's strange listening habits, and Ishigami's attempt at taking the fall for her, made her feel more like a little weirdo, and by now, a bit of weirdness is basically a requirement to be a student council member.    This is important because there's a playfulness inherent to Kaguya-sama that Iino's rigidity seemed antithetical to, but ended up on full display for the rest of the episode. Teenagers aren't my area of expertise, but they're still kids, and kids need to play! They need to be awkward and obsess over things like read receipts on messaging apps and boast and set up arm-wrestling tournaments instead of doing their actual work. Their personalities are exaggerated and caricatured, but few comedies capture those special moments where you get a strange idea and just keep going with it.    That playfulness extends to the visual presentation as well. The animation in this season has so far been fairly middle of the road, and thus I haven't commented on it much, but Kaguya-sama has some of the best goddamn direction and animation in the medium. Mamoru Hatakeyama and his team almost always manage to elevate the manga's punchlines into something special, and they held nothing back this episode. From the camel wandering around in the background as Iino studies, to Shirogane's shifting body language as he realizes he has the upper hand on Kaguya over the phone, to making the picture quality look like a VHS transfer – every frame has something joyful and unexpected. Big gags and subtle expressions alike have been animated with equal levels of care.    If you haven't watched Kaguya-sama: Love is War yet… why not? It's seriously one of the best anime comedies ever made. Why deprive yourself?       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               After having watched two full seasons, it's become perfectly clear that Kaguya-sama isn't for me (except in the rare cases where it is). Being mostly a series of short gags—usually involving instant karma as one of the student council members attempts to assert dominance over the others in some way—means that there's not much to further develop the characters or progress the love story between Shinomiya and Shirogane. The episodes of the series I most enjoy tend to be the final few of the season where meaningful things happen and there is real drama and tangible stakes. This season premiere was most certainly not one of those episodes.    Now, that's not to say I don't find the humor of the show funny in its own right. From Ishigami futilely trying to stop Iino from embarrassing herself to Shinomiya's ignorance about the differences between email and texting, there are a ton of great gags in this episode. The final self-contained story about the arm wrestling tournament takes things to a whole other level—especially with its post-credits scene showing that Fujiwara was just talking trash the whole time and couldn't win without cheating.    But what takes all these gags to the next level is the animation that merges what's really going on with what the characters are thinking to create something as funny as it is surreal. From the large camel making noises in Iino's ear to the mountain of bodybuilders supporting Shinomiya, it's all but impossible not to laugh.    So while Kaguya-sama isn't my cup of tea in general, I wouldn't say that this is a bad episode. In fact, it is pretty much the epitome of what Kaguya-sama is at its essence. If you ever need a laugh, Kaguya-sama is eager to deliver—just don't expect anything more.       James Beckett  Rating:               One of the “benefits” of being a teacher is getting to essentially serve as a kind of covert anthropologist that specializes in that most elusive and influential of species: The modern teenager. I'm like Jane Goodall; I live among them, in their native environment, and since they give absolutely zero shits about what I think, I have free reign to study the peculiar social rituals and developmental adaptations that these hormonal and aggressive pack animals undergo. As such, I feel like I can say, with legitimately authoritative expertise, that one of the things that makes Kaguya-sama: Love is War such a smashing success is how well it understands the interior lives of teenagers. Specifically, it has a comprehensive understanding of all the ridiculously dumb shit that teenagers will do to and with one another when left to their own devices. More importantly, it gets that all of this inane tomfoolery, no matter how stupid, will feel to a teenager like the most earth-shatteringly consequential events that will ever occur in their lifetimes.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War –Ultra Romantic– is essentially more of the same, in that regard. The goofy kids of Shuchiin Academy's student council spend their days getting into the most ridiculous of shenanigans, while Kaguya and Miyuki sloooooooowly progress along their romantic destinies with one another. “More of the same” can come across as a backhanded compliment, but that couldn't be further from the truth in the case of an anime like Kaguya-sama, considering that the “same” in question happens to be some of the most consistently hilarious and expertly animated comedy in the business.    Each of the three sketches in this premiere does what Kaguya-sama does best, in that they take painfully relatable, everyday scenarios and crank the intensity so far past the eleven mark that the the dial may as well be ripped clean off. The opening sketch is perhaps the weakest of the three, since it focuses on Yu trying to deal with Miko not realizing that people can hear the weird crap she listens to when she's studying, and neither of these characters are the strongest of the ensemble. The joke about Miko's weird listening habits is also just not terribly funny, though that might be because that my own ADHD has had me go to some truly strange and avant garde places in search of distracting sounds to play when I'm trying to focus.    The other two scenes are golden, though, and they show off a wide variety of Kaguya-sama's strengths. The “Read Receipts” sketch is a masterpiece of observational humor, mining Kaguya's technological naivety and featuring Miyuki in full-on petty-goblin mode. It's one of those bits where the show manages to generate horror movie levels of tension on behalf of these loveably awkward children and their inability to just have a normal conversation. We also get a lot of good Ai content, which is always a bonus.    The “Arm Wrestling” sketch is just as hilarious, mostly because it's one of those showcases that gets the whole cast in on a silly mess-around that allows the artists at A-1 Pictures to really strut their stuff. It would already have been funny to have Chika get so obsessed with putting on an arm- wrestling contest, but Kaguya-sama goes the extra mile by animating the ever-loving hell out of it all. I demand a raise specifically for whoever got to handle the cut where Miyuki's face nearly implodes against the fury of Kaguya's sweat-hands fury (we've all been there, girl, there's no shame in it).    Do you honestly need me to tell you that Kaguya-sama's third season is mandatory viewing for this spring? Of course not. It's proven itself time and time again. Still, in case it needs to be said: Yes, the show is great, and you should absolutely watch it. Duh-doy, Britta.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There really is nothing else quite like Kaguya-sama is there? Even as a self-proclaimed connoisseur of romcoms, it's hard to think of another series that managed to take such a simple premise and spin it into one of the most infectiously hilarious – and consistent – anime comedies of the past decade. But whatever alchemy is happening between the source material and the always exuberant adaptation team is still firing on all cylinders, and they've come back from season two without missing a step.    The series isn't resting on its laurels for this sequel either. It'd be easy to throw us back in with a classic Kaguya vs Shirogane battle, but instead they used the opportunity to demonstrate just how much good the previous season did for the show's weakest characters. Not only are Ishigami and Iino capable of carrying a skit almost entirely on their own, but they're able to do it in a way that capitalizes on all of  Ishigami's growth from the previous arc, going from the show's go-to punching bag to the kind of selfless idiot-genius that butters this show's bread. It's an unconventional way to welcome viewers back, but nonetheless promises to be just as hilarious as always.    From there, it's the same Kaguya-sama that steamrolled through our hearts in the previous seasons. The characters are still a blast, and the direction is as committed as ever to ridiculous, eclectic, and endlessly creative visual gags to sell every joke. It's not doing anything particularly new for the series, but that's a “don't mess with perfection” situation if ever there was one. I can attest to having a stupid smile plastered on my face across the entire premiere, and I busted out laughing as these kids tried to Death Note their way through being left on read, or when an homage to the soundtrack of Over The Top started playing during their arm-wrestling tournament. It's the kind of layered, high-effort joke that sets this show apart from the rest of its subgenre, and it's just so nice to have it back.    If you've missed this runaway train of a show, there probably aren't enough creatively directed romantic mind games in the world to convince you at this point. But if you're already a fan who was just worried the magic might have run out after all this time, you've got nothing to worry about. Kaguya-sama is back and in championship form once again.     discuss this in the forum (249 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          14 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr 10, 07:52 14 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Teenagers aren't my area of expertise, but they're still kids, and kids need to play! They need to be awkward and obsess over things like read receipts on messaging apps and boast and set up arm-wrestling tournaments instead of doing their actual work. Their personalities are exaggerated and caricatured, but few comedies capture those special moments where you get a strange idea and just keep going with it.

The opening sketch is perhaps the weakest of the three, since it focuses on Yu trying to deal with Miko not realizing that people can hear the weird crap she listens to when she's studying, and neither of these characters are the strongest of the ensemble. The joke about Miko's weird listening habits is also just not terribly funny, though that might be because that my own ADHD has had me go to some truly strange and avant garde places in search of distracting sounds to play when I'm trying to focus.    The other two scenes are golden, though, and they show off a wide variety of Kaguya-sama's strengths. The “Read Receipts” sketch is a masterpiece of observational humor, mining Kaguya's technological naivety and featuring Miyuki in full-on petty-goblin mode. It's one of those bits where the show manages to generate horror movie levels of tension on behalf of these loveably awkward children and their inability to just have a normal conversation. We also get a lot of good Ai content, which is always a bonus.    The “Arm Wrestling” sketch is just as hilarious, mostly because it's one of those showcases that gets the whole cast in on a silly mess-around that allows the artists at A-1 Pictures to really strut their stuff. It would already have been funny to have Chika get so obsessed with putting on an arm- wrestling contest, but Kaguya-sama goes the extra mile by animating the ever-loving hell out of it all. I demand a raise specifically for whoever got to handle the cut where Miyuki's face nearly implodes against the fury of Kaguya's sweat-hands fury (we've all been there, girl, there's no shame in it).    Do you honestly need me to tell you that Kaguya-sama's third season is mandatory viewing for this spring? Of course not. It's proven itself time and time again. Still, in case it needs to be said: Yes, the show is great, and you should absolutely watch it. Duh-doy, Britta.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There really is nothing else quite like Kaguya-sama is there? Even as a self-proclaimed connoisseur of romcoms, it's hard to think of another series that managed to take such a simple premise and spin it into one of the most infectiously hilarious – and consistent – anime comedies of the past decade. But whatever alchemy is happening between the source material and the always exuberant adaptation team is still firing on all cylinders, and they've come back from season two without missing a step.    The series isn't resting on its laurels for this sequel either. It'd be easy to throw us back in with a classic Kaguya vs Shirogane battle, but instead they used the opportunity to demonstrate just how much good the previous season did for the show's weakest characters. Not only are Ishigami and Iino capable of carrying a skit almost entirely on their own, but they're able to do it in a way that capitalizes on all of  Ishigami's growth from the previous arc, going from the show's go-to punching bag to the kind of selfless idiot-genius that butters this show's bread. It's an unconventional way to welcome viewers back, but nonetheless promises to be just as hilarious as always.    From there, it's the same Kaguya-sama that steamrolled through our hearts in the previous seasons. The characters are still a blast, and the direction is as committed as ever to ridiculous, eclectic, and endlessly creative visual gags to sell every joke. It's not doing anything particularly new for the series, but that's a “don't mess with perfection” situation if ever there was one. I can attest to having a stupid smile plastered on my face across the entire premiere, and I busted out laughing as these kids tried to Death Note their way through being left on read, or when an homage to the soundtrack of Over The Top started playing during their arm-wrestling tournament. It's the kind of layered, high-effort joke that sets this show apart from the rest of its subgenre, and it's just so nice to have it back.    If you've missed this runaway train of a show, there probably aren't enough creatively directed romantic mind games in the world to convince you at this point. But if you're already a fan who was just worried the magic might have run out after all this time, you've got nothing to worry about. Kaguya-sama is back and in championship form once again.     discuss this in the forum (249 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          14 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr 10, 07:52 14 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic ?                     Community score: 4.6              What is this?   Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are two geniuses who stand atop their prestigious academy's student council, making them the elite among elite. But it's lonely at the top and each has fallen for the other. There's just one huge problem standing in the way of lovey-dovey bliss—they're both too prideful to be the first to confess their romantic feelings and thus become the “loser” in the competition of love.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic is the latest entry in the television anime based on Aka Akasaka's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I can't believe that in one day, two of my favorite romances had new seasons start! Premiere season is tough, but days like this make it worth it. Kaguya-sama: Love is War has returned for a third season, picking right back where the previous season left off, and boy, am I glad to see these kids with all their weird little quirks and foibles again.    I wasn't totally sold on Miko Iino by the end of the previous season, unsure of where she would fit into the group dynamic with rigid prudishness as her primary character trait. So of course, the episode leads with a skit between her and Ishigami, who once upon a time was one of the worst characters but is now one of the best. Miko's strange listening habits, and Ishigami's attempt at taking the fall for her, made her feel more like a little weirdo, and by now, a bit of weirdness is basically a requirement to be a student council member.    This is important because there's a playfulness inherent to Kaguya-sama that Iino's rigidity seemed antithetical to, but ended up on full display for the rest of the episode. Teenagers aren't my area of expertise, but they're still kids, and kids need to play! They need to be awkward and obsess over things like read receipts on messaging apps and boast and set up arm-wrestling tournaments instead of doing their actual work. Their personalities are exaggerated and caricatured, but few comedies capture those special moments where you get a strange idea and just keep going with it.    That playfulness extends to the visual presentation as well. The animation in this season has so far been fairly middle of the road, and thus I haven't commented on it much, but Kaguya-sama has some of the best goddamn direction and animation in the medium. Mamoru Hatakeyama and his team almost always manage to elevate the manga's punchlines into something special, and they held nothing back this episode. From the camel wandering around in the background as Iino studies, to Shirogane's shifting body language as he realizes he has the upper hand on Kaguya over the phone, to making the picture quality look like a VHS transfer – every frame has something joyful and unexpected. Big gags and subtle expressions alike have been animated with equal levels of care.    If you haven't watched Kaguya-sama: Love is War yet… why not? It's seriously one of the best anime comedies ever made. Why deprive yourself?       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               After having watched two full seasons, it's become perfectly clear that Kaguya-sama isn't for me (except in the rare cases where it is). Being mostly a series of short gags—usually involving instant karma as one of the student council members attempts to assert dominance over the others in some way—means that there's not much to further develop the characters or progress the love story between Shinomiya and Shirogane. The episodes of the series I most enjoy tend to be the final few of the season where meaningful things happen and there is real drama and tangible stakes. This season premiere was most certainly not one of those episodes.    Now, that's not to say I don't find the humor of the show funny in its own right. From Ishigami futilely trying to stop Iino from embarrassing herself to Shinomiya's ignorance about the differences between email and texting, there are a ton of great gags in this episode. The final self-contained story about the arm wrestling tournament takes things to a whole other level—especially with its post-credits scene showing that Fujiwara was just talking trash the whole time and couldn't win without cheating.    But what takes all these gags to the next level is the animation that merges what's really going on with what the characters are thinking to create something as funny as it is surreal. From the large camel making noises in Iino's ear to the mountain of bodybuilders supporting Shinomiya, it's all but impossible not to laugh.    So while Kaguya-sama isn't my cup of tea in general, I wouldn't say that this is a bad episode. In fact, it is pretty much the epitome of what Kaguya-sama is at its essence. If you ever need a laugh, Kaguya-sama is eager to deliver—just don't expect anything more.       James Beckett  Rating:               One of the “benefits” of being a teacher is getting to essentially serve as a kind of covert anthropologist that specializes in that most elusive and influential of species: The modern teenager. I'm like Jane Goodall; I live among them, in their native environment, and since they give absolutely zero shits about what I think, I have free reign to study the peculiar social rituals and developmental adaptations that these hormonal and aggressive pack animals undergo. As such, I feel like I can say, with legitimately authoritative expertise, that one of the things that makes Kaguya-sama: Love is War such a smashing success is how well it understands the interior lives of teenagers. Specifically, it has a comprehensive understanding of all the ridiculously dumb shit that teenagers will do to and with one another when left to their own devices. More importantly, it gets that all of this inane tomfoolery, no matter how stupid, will feel to a teenager like the most earth-shatteringly consequential events that will ever occur in their lifetimes.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War –Ultra Romantic– is essentially more of the same, in that regard. The goofy kids of Shuchiin Academy's student council spend their days getting into the most ridiculous of shenanigans, while Kaguya and Miyuki sloooooooowly progress along their romantic destinies with one another. “More of the same” can come across as a backhanded compliment, but that couldn't be further from the truth in the case of an anime like Kaguya-sama, considering that the “same” in question happens to be some of the most consistently hilarious and expertly animated comedy in the business.

More importantly, it gets that all of this inane tomfoolery, no matter how stupid, will feel to a teenager like the most earth-shatteringly consequential events that will ever occur in their lifetimes.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War –Ultra Romantic– is essentially more of the same, in that regard. The goofy kids of Shuchiin Academy's student council spend their days getting into the most ridiculous of shenanigans, while Kaguya and Miyuki sloooooooowly progress along their romantic destinies with one another. “More of the same” can come across as a backhanded compliment, but that couldn't be further from the truth in the case of an anime like Kaguya-sama, considering that the “same” in question happens to be some of the most consistently hilarious and expertly animated comedy in the business.    Each of the three sketches in this premiere does what Kaguya-sama does best, in that they take painfully relatable, everyday scenarios and crank the intensity so far past the eleven mark that the the dial may as well be ripped clean off. The opening sketch is perhaps the weakest of the three, since it focuses on Yu trying to deal with Miko not realizing that people can hear the weird crap she listens to when she's studying, and neither of these characters are the strongest of the ensemble. The joke about Miko's weird listening habits is also just not terribly funny, though that might be because that my own ADHD has had me go to some truly strange and avant garde places in search of distracting sounds to play when I'm trying to focus.    The other two scenes are golden, though, and they show off a wide variety of Kaguya-sama's strengths. The “Read Receipts” sketch is a masterpiece of observational humor, mining Kaguya's technological naivety and featuring Miyuki in full-on petty-goblin mode. It's one of those bits where the show manages to generate horror movie levels of tension on behalf of these loveably awkward children and their inability to just have a normal conversation. We also get a lot of good Ai content, which is always a bonus.    The “Arm Wrestling” sketch is just as hilarious, mostly because it's one of those showcases that gets the whole cast in on a silly mess-around that allows the artists at A-1 Pictures to really strut their stuff. It would already have been funny to have Chika get so obsessed with putting on an arm- wrestling contest, but Kaguya-sama goes the extra mile by animating the ever-loving hell out of it all. I demand a raise specifically for whoever got to handle the cut where Miyuki's face nearly implodes against the fury of Kaguya's sweat-hands fury (we've all been there, girl, there's no shame in it).    Do you honestly need me to tell you that Kaguya-sama's third season is mandatory viewing for this spring? Of course not. It's proven itself time and time again. Still, in case it needs to be said: Yes, the show is great, and you should absolutely watch it. Duh-doy, Britta.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There really is nothing else quite like Kaguya-sama is there? Even as a self-proclaimed connoisseur of romcoms, it's hard to think of another series that managed to take such a simple premise and spin it into one of the most infectiously hilarious – and consistent – anime comedies of the past decade. But whatever alchemy is happening between the source material and the always exuberant adaptation team is still firing on all cylinders, and they've come back from season two without missing a step.    The series isn't resting on its laurels for this sequel either. It'd be easy to throw us back in with a classic Kaguya vs Shirogane battle, but instead they used the opportunity to demonstrate just how much good the previous season did for the show's weakest characters. Not only are Ishigami and Iino capable of carrying a skit almost entirely on their own, but they're able to do it in a way that capitalizes on all of  Ishigami's growth from the previous arc, going from the show's go-to punching bag to the kind of selfless idiot-genius that butters this show's bread. It's an unconventional way to welcome viewers back, but nonetheless promises to be just as hilarious as always.    From there, it's the same Kaguya-sama that steamrolled through our hearts in the previous seasons. The characters are still a blast, and the direction is as committed as ever to ridiculous, eclectic, and endlessly creative visual gags to sell every joke. It's not doing anything particularly new for the series, but that's a “don't mess with perfection” situation if ever there was one. I can attest to having a stupid smile plastered on my face across the entire premiere, and I busted out laughing as these kids tried to Death Note their way through being left on read, or when an homage to the soundtrack of Over The Top started playing during their arm-wrestling tournament. It's the kind of layered, high-effort joke that sets this show apart from the rest of its subgenre, and it's just so nice to have it back.    If you've missed this runaway train of a show, there probably aren't enough creatively directed romantic mind games in the world to convince you at this point. But if you're already a fan who was just worried the magic might have run out after all this time, you've got nothing to worry about. Kaguya-sama is back and in championship form once again.     discuss this in the forum (249 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic ?                     Community score: 4.6              What is this?   Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are two geniuses who stand atop their prestigious academy's student council, making them the elite among elite. But it's lonely at the top and each has fallen for the other. There's just one huge problem standing in the way of lovey-dovey bliss—they're both too prideful to be the first to confess their romantic feelings and thus become the “loser” in the competition of love.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic is the latest entry in the television anime based on Aka Akasaka's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I can't believe that in one day, two of my favorite romances had new seasons start! Premiere season is tough, but days like this make it worth it. Kaguya-sama: Love is War has returned for a third season, picking right back where the previous season left off, and boy, am I glad to see these kids with all their weird little quirks and foibles again.    I wasn't totally sold on Miko Iino by the end of the previous season, unsure of where she would fit into the group dynamic with rigid prudishness as her primary character trait. So of course, the episode leads with a skit between her and Ishigami, who once upon a time was one of the worst characters but is now one of the best. Miko's strange listening habits, and Ishigami's attempt at taking the fall for her, made her feel more like a little weirdo, and by now, a bit of weirdness is basically a requirement to be a student council member.    This is important because there's a playfulness inherent to Kaguya-sama that Iino's rigidity seemed antithetical to, but ended up on full display for the rest of the episode. Teenagers aren't my area of expertise, but they're still kids, and kids need to play! They need to be awkward and obsess over things like read receipts on messaging apps and boast and set up arm-wrestling tournaments instead of doing their actual work. Their personalities are exaggerated and caricatured, but few comedies capture those special moments where you get a strange idea and just keep going with it.    That playfulness extends to the visual presentation as well. The animation in this season has so far been fairly middle of the road, and thus I haven't commented on it much, but Kaguya-sama has some of the best goddamn direction and animation in the medium. Mamoru Hatakeyama and his team almost always manage to elevate the manga's punchlines into something special, and they held nothing back this episode. From the camel wandering around in the background as Iino studies, to Shirogane's shifting body language as he realizes he has the upper hand on Kaguya over the phone, to making the picture quality look like a VHS transfer – every frame has something joyful and unexpected. Big gags and subtle expressions alike have been animated with equal levels of care.    If you haven't watched Kaguya-sama: Love is War yet… why not? It's seriously one of the best anime comedies ever made. Why deprive yourself?       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               After having watched two full seasons, it's become perfectly clear that Kaguya-sama isn't for me (except in the rare cases where it is). Being mostly a series of short gags—usually involving instant karma as one of the student council members attempts to assert dominance over the others in some way—means that there's not much to further develop the characters or progress the love story between Shinomiya and Shirogane. The episodes of the series I most enjoy tend to be the final few of the season where meaningful things happen and there is real drama and tangible stakes. This season premiere was most certainly not one of those episodes.    Now, that's not to say I don't find the humor of the show funny in its own right. From Ishigami futilely trying to stop Iino from embarrassing herself to Shinomiya's ignorance about the differences between email and texting, there are a ton of great gags in this episode. The final self-contained story about the arm wrestling tournament takes things to a whole other level—especially with its post-credits scene showing that Fujiwara was just talking trash the whole time and couldn't win without cheating.    But what takes all these gags to the next level is the animation that merges what's really going on with what the characters are thinking to create something as funny as it is surreal. From the large camel making noises in Iino's ear to the mountain of bodybuilders supporting Shinomiya, it's all but impossible not to laugh.    So while Kaguya-sama isn't my cup of tea in general, I wouldn't say that this is a bad episode. In fact, it is pretty much the epitome of what Kaguya-sama is at its essence. If you ever need a laugh, Kaguya-sama is eager to deliver—just don't expect anything more.       James Beckett  Rating:               One of the “benefits” of being a teacher is getting to essentially serve as a kind of covert anthropologist that specializes in that most elusive and influential of species: The modern teenager. I'm like Jane Goodall; I live among them, in their native environment, and since they give absolutely zero shits about what I think, I have free reign to study the peculiar social rituals and developmental adaptations that these hormonal and aggressive pack animals undergo. As such, I feel like I can say, with legitimately authoritative expertise, that one of the things that makes Kaguya-sama: Love is War such a smashing success is how well it understands the interior lives of teenagers. Specifically, it has a comprehensive understanding of all the ridiculously dumb shit that teenagers will do to and with one another when left to their own devices.

Teenagers aren't my area of expertise, but they're still kids, and kids need to play! They need to be awkward and obsess over things like read receipts on messaging apps and boast and set up arm-wrestling tournaments instead of doing their actual work. Their personalities are exaggerated and caricatured, but few comedies capture those special moments where you get a strange idea and just keep going with it.    That playfulness extends to the visual presentation as well. The animation in this season has so far been fairly middle of the road, and thus I haven't commented on it much, but Kaguya-sama has some of the best goddamn direction and animation in the medium. Mamoru Hatakeyama and his team almost always manage to elevate the manga's punchlines into something special, and they held nothing back this episode. From the camel wandering around in the background as Iino studies, to Shirogane's shifting body language as he realizes he has the upper hand on Kaguya over the phone, to making the picture quality look like a VHS transfer – every frame has something joyful and unexpected. Big gags and subtle expressions alike have been animated with equal levels of care.    If you haven't watched Kaguya-sama: Love is War yet… why not? It's seriously one of the best anime comedies ever made. Why deprive yourself?       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               After having watched two full seasons, it's become perfectly clear that Kaguya-sama isn't for me (except in the rare cases where it is). Being mostly a series of short gags—usually involving instant karma as one of the student council members attempts to assert dominance over the others in some way—means that there's not much to further develop the characters or progress the love story between Shinomiya and Shirogane. The episodes of the series I most enjoy tend to be the final few of the season where meaningful things happen and there is real drama and tangible stakes. This season premiere was most certainly not one of those episodes.    Now, that's not to say I don't find the humor of the show funny in its own right. From Ishigami futilely trying to stop Iino from embarrassing herself to Shinomiya's ignorance about the differences between email and texting, there are a ton of great gags in this episode. The final self-contained story about the arm wrestling tournament takes things to a whole other level—especially with its post-credits scene showing that Fujiwara was just talking trash the whole time and couldn't win without cheating.    But what takes all these gags to the next level is the animation that merges what's really going on with what the characters are thinking to create something as funny as it is surreal. From the large camel making noises in Iino's ear to the mountain of bodybuilders supporting Shinomiya, it's all but impossible not to laugh.    So while Kaguya-sama isn't my cup of tea in general, I wouldn't say that this is a bad episode. In fact, it is pretty much the epitome of what Kaguya-sama is at its essence. If you ever need a laugh, Kaguya-sama is eager to deliver—just don't expect anything more.       James Beckett  Rating:               One of the “benefits” of being a teacher is getting to essentially serve as a kind of covert anthropologist that specializes in that most elusive and influential of species: The modern teenager. I'm like Jane Goodall; I live among them, in their native environment, and since they give absolutely zero shits about what I think, I have free reign to study the peculiar social rituals and developmental adaptations that these hormonal and aggressive pack animals undergo. As such, I feel like I can say, with legitimately authoritative expertise, that one of the things that makes Kaguya-sama: Love is War such a smashing success is how well it understands the interior lives of teenagers. Specifically, it has a comprehensive understanding of all the ridiculously dumb shit that teenagers will do to and with one another when left to their own devices. More importantly, it gets that all of this inane tomfoolery, no matter how stupid, will feel to a teenager like the most earth-shatteringly consequential events that will ever occur in their lifetimes.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War –Ultra Romantic– is essentially more of the same, in that regard. The goofy kids of Shuchiin Academy's student council spend their days getting into the most ridiculous of shenanigans, while Kaguya and Miyuki sloooooooowly progress along their romantic destinies with one another. “More of the same” can come across as a backhanded compliment, but that couldn't be further from the truth in the case of an anime like Kaguya-sama, considering that the “same” in question happens to be some of the most consistently hilarious and expertly animated comedy in the business.    Each of the three sketches in this premiere does what Kaguya-sama does best, in that they take painfully relatable, everyday scenarios and crank the intensity so far past the eleven mark that the the dial may as well be ripped clean off. The opening sketch is perhaps the weakest of the three, since it focuses on Yu trying to deal with Miko not realizing that people can hear the weird crap she listens to when she's studying, and neither of these characters are the strongest of the ensemble. The joke about Miko's weird listening habits is also just not terribly funny, though that might be because that my own ADHD has had me go to some truly strange and avant garde places in search of distracting sounds to play when I'm trying to focus.    The other two scenes are golden, though, and they show off a wide variety of Kaguya-sama's strengths. The “Read Receipts” sketch is a masterpiece of observational humor, mining Kaguya's technological naivety and featuring Miyuki in full-on petty-goblin mode. It's one of those bits where the show manages to generate horror movie levels of tension on behalf of these loveably awkward children and their inability to just have a normal conversation. We also get a lot of good Ai content, which is always a bonus.    The “Arm Wrestling” sketch is just as hilarious, mostly because it's one of those showcases that gets the whole cast in on a silly mess-around that allows the artists at A-1 Pictures to really strut their stuff. It would already have been funny to have Chika get so obsessed with putting on an arm- wrestling contest, but Kaguya-sama goes the extra mile by animating the ever-loving hell out of it all. I demand a raise specifically for whoever got to handle the cut where Miyuki's face nearly implodes against the fury of Kaguya's sweat-hands fury (we've all been there, girl, there's no shame in it).    Do you honestly need me to tell you that Kaguya-sama's third season is mandatory viewing for this spring? Of course not. It's proven itself time and time again. Still, in case it needs to be said: Yes, the show is great, and you should absolutely watch it. Duh-doy, Britta.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There really is nothing else quite like Kaguya-sama is there? Even as a self-proclaimed connoisseur of romcoms, it's hard to think of another series that managed to take such a simple premise and spin it into one of the most infectiously hilarious – and consistent – anime comedies of the past decade. But whatever alchemy is happening between the source material and the always exuberant adaptation team is still firing on all cylinders, and they've come back from season two without missing a step.    The series isn't resting on its laurels for this sequel either. It'd be easy to throw us back in with a classic Kaguya vs Shirogane battle, but instead they used the opportunity to demonstrate just how much good the previous season did for the show's weakest characters. Not only are Ishigami and Iino capable of carrying a skit almost entirely on their own, but they're able to do it in a way that capitalizes on all of  Ishigami's growth from the previous arc, going from the show's go-to punching bag to the kind of selfless idiot-genius that butters this show's bread. It's an unconventional way to welcome viewers back, but nonetheless promises to be just as hilarious as always.    From there, it's the same Kaguya-sama that steamrolled through our hearts in the previous seasons. The characters are still a blast, and the direction is as committed as ever to ridiculous, eclectic, and endlessly creative visual gags to sell every joke. It's not doing anything particularly new for the series, but that's a “don't mess with perfection” situation if ever there was one. I can attest to having a stupid smile plastered on my face across the entire premiere, and I busted out laughing as these kids tried to Death Note their way through being left on read, or when an homage to the soundtrack of Over The Top started playing during their arm-wrestling tournament. It's the kind of layered, high-effort joke that sets this show apart from the rest of its subgenre, and it's just so nice to have it back.    If you've missed this runaway train of a show, there probably aren't enough creatively directed romantic mind games in the world to convince you at this point. But if you're already a fan who was just worried the magic might have run out after all this time, you've got nothing to worry about.

Community score: 4.6              What is this?   Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are two geniuses who stand atop their prestigious academy's student council, making them the elite among elite. But it's lonely at the top and each has fallen for the other.

Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic is the latest entry in the television anime based on Aka Akasaka's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I can't believe that in one day, two of my favorite romances had new seasons start! Premiere season is tough, but days like this make it worth it. Kaguya-sama: Love is War has returned for a third season, picking right back where the previous season left off, and boy, am I glad to see these kids with all their weird little quirks and foibles again.    I wasn't totally sold on Miko Iino by the end of the previous season, unsure of where she would fit into the group dynamic with rigid prudishness as her primary character trait. So of course, the episode leads with a skit between her and Ishigami, who once upon a time was one of the worst characters but is now one of the best.

Community score: 4.6              What is this?   Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are two geniuses who stand atop their prestigious academy's student council, making them the elite among elite. But it's lonely at the top and each has fallen for the other. There's just one huge problem standing in the way of lovey-dovey bliss—they're both too prideful to be the first to confess their romantic feelings and thus become the “loser” in the competition of love.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic is the latest entry in the television anime based on Aka Akasaka's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I can't believe that in one day, two of my favorite romances had new seasons start! Premiere season is tough, but days like this make it worth it. Kaguya-sama: Love is War has returned for a third season, picking right back where the previous season left off, and boy, am I glad to see these kids with all their weird little quirks and foibles again.    I wasn't totally sold on Miko Iino by the end of the previous season, unsure of where she would fit into the group dynamic with rigid prudishness as her primary character trait. So of course, the episode leads with a skit between her and Ishigami, who once upon a time was one of the worst characters but is now one of the best. Miko's strange listening habits, and Ishigami's attempt at taking the fall for her, made her feel more like a little weirdo, and by now, a bit of weirdness is basically a requirement to be a student council member.    This is important because there's a playfulness inherent to Kaguya-sama that Iino's rigidity seemed antithetical to, but ended up on full display for the rest of the episode. Teenagers aren't my area of expertise, but they're still kids, and kids need to play! They need to be awkward and obsess over things like read receipts on messaging apps and boast and set up arm-wrestling tournaments instead of doing their actual work. Their personalities are exaggerated and caricatured, but few comedies capture those special moments where you get a strange idea and just keep going with it.    That playfulness extends to the visual presentation as well. The animation in this season has so far been fairly middle of the road, and thus I haven't commented on it much, but Kaguya-sama has some of the best goddamn direction and animation in the medium. Mamoru Hatakeyama and his team almost always manage to elevate the manga's punchlines into something special, and they held nothing back this episode. From the camel wandering around in the background as Iino studies, to Shirogane's shifting body language as he realizes he has the upper hand on Kaguya over the phone, to making the picture quality look like a VHS transfer – every frame has something joyful and unexpected. Big gags and subtle expressions alike have been animated with equal levels of care.    If you haven't watched Kaguya-sama: Love is War yet… why not? It's seriously one of the best anime comedies ever made. Why deprive yourself?       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               After having watched two full seasons, it's become perfectly clear that Kaguya-sama isn't for me (except in the rare cases where it is). Being mostly a series of short gags—usually involving instant karma as one of the student council members attempts to assert dominance over the others in some way—means that there's not much to further develop the characters or progress the love story between Shinomiya and Shirogane. The episodes of the series I most enjoy tend to be the final few of the season where meaningful things happen and there is real drama and tangible stakes. This season premiere was most certainly not one of those episodes.    Now, that's not to say I don't find the humor of the show funny in its own right. From Ishigami futilely trying to stop Iino from embarrassing herself to Shinomiya's ignorance about the differences between email and texting, there are a ton of great gags in this episode. The final self-contained story about the arm wrestling tournament takes things to a whole other level—especially with its post-credits scene showing that Fujiwara was just talking trash the whole time and couldn't win without cheating.    But what takes all these gags to the next level is the animation that merges what's really going on with what the characters are thinking to create something as funny as it is surreal. From the large camel making noises in Iino's ear to the mountain of bodybuilders supporting Shinomiya, it's all but impossible not to laugh.    So while Kaguya-sama isn't my cup of tea in general, I wouldn't say that this is a bad episode. In fact, it is pretty much the epitome of what Kaguya-sama is at its essence. If you ever need a laugh, Kaguya-sama is eager to deliver—just don't expect anything more.       James Beckett  Rating:               One of the “benefits” of being a teacher is getting to essentially serve as a kind of covert anthropologist that specializes in that most elusive and influential of species: The modern teenager. I'm like Jane Goodall; I live among them, in their native environment, and since they give absolutely zero shits about what I think, I have free reign to study the peculiar social rituals and developmental adaptations that these hormonal and aggressive pack animals undergo. As such, I feel like I can say, with legitimately authoritative expertise, that one of the things that makes Kaguya-sama: Love is War such a smashing success is how well it understands the interior lives of teenagers. Specifically, it has a comprehensive understanding of all the ridiculously dumb shit that teenagers will do to and with one another when left to their own devices. More importantly, it gets that all of this inane tomfoolery, no matter how stupid, will feel to a teenager like the most earth-shatteringly consequential events that will ever occur in their lifetimes.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War –Ultra Romantic– is essentially more of the same, in that regard. The goofy kids of Shuchiin Academy's student council spend their days getting into the most ridiculous of shenanigans, while Kaguya and Miyuki sloooooooowly progress along their romantic destinies with one another. “More of the same” can come across as a backhanded compliment, but that couldn't be further from the truth in the case of an anime like Kaguya-sama, considering that the “same” in question happens to be some of the most consistently hilarious and expertly animated comedy in the business.    Each of the three sketches in this premiere does what Kaguya-sama does best, in that they take painfully relatable, everyday scenarios and crank the intensity so far past the eleven mark that the the dial may as well be ripped clean off. The opening sketch is perhaps the weakest of the three, since it focuses on Yu trying to deal with Miko not realizing that people can hear the weird crap she listens to when she's studying, and neither of these characters are the strongest of the ensemble. The joke about Miko's weird listening habits is also just not terribly funny, though that might be because that my own ADHD has had me go to some truly strange and avant garde places in search of distracting sounds to play when I'm trying to focus.    The other two scenes are golden, though, and they show off a wide variety of Kaguya-sama's strengths. The “Read Receipts” sketch is a masterpiece of observational humor, mining Kaguya's technological naivety and featuring Miyuki in full-on petty-goblin mode. It's one of those bits where the show manages to generate horror movie levels of tension on behalf of these loveably awkward children and their inability to just have a normal conversation. We also get a lot of good Ai content, which is always a bonus.    The “Arm Wrestling” sketch is just as hilarious, mostly because it's one of those showcases that gets the whole cast in on a silly mess-around that allows the artists at A-1 Pictures to really strut their stuff. It would already have been funny to have Chika get so obsessed with putting on an arm- wrestling contest, but Kaguya-sama goes the extra mile by animating the ever-loving hell out of it all. I demand a raise specifically for whoever got to handle the cut where Miyuki's face nearly implodes against the fury of Kaguya's sweat-hands fury (we've all been there, girl, there's no shame in it).    Do you honestly need me to tell you that Kaguya-sama's third season is mandatory viewing for this spring? Of course not. It's proven itself time and time again. Still, in case it needs to be said: Yes, the show is great, and you should absolutely watch it. Duh-doy, Britta.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There really is nothing else quite like Kaguya-sama is there? Even as a self-proclaimed connoisseur of romcoms, it's hard to think of another series that managed to take such a simple premise and spin it into one of the most infectiously hilarious – and consistent – anime comedies of the past decade. But whatever alchemy is happening between the source material and the always exuberant adaptation team is still firing on all cylinders, and they've come back from season two without missing a step.    The series isn't resting on its laurels for this sequel either. It'd be easy to throw us back in with a classic Kaguya vs Shirogane battle, but instead they used the opportunity to demonstrate just how much good the previous season did for the show's weakest characters. Not only are Ishigami and Iino capable of carrying a skit almost entirely on their own, but they're able to do it in a way that capitalizes on all of  Ishigami's growth from the previous arc, going from the show's go-to punching bag to the kind of selfless idiot-genius that butters this show's bread. It's an unconventional way to welcome viewers back, but nonetheless promises to be just as hilarious as always.    From there, it's the same Kaguya-sama that steamrolled through our hearts in the previous seasons. The characters are still a blast, and the direction is as committed as ever to ridiculous, eclectic, and endlessly creative visual gags to sell every joke. It's not doing anything particularly new for the series, but that's a “don't mess with perfection” situation if ever there was one. I can attest to having a stupid smile plastered on my face across the entire premiere, and I busted out laughing as these kids tried to Death Note their way through being left on read, or when an homage to the soundtrack of Over The Top started playing during their arm-wrestling tournament. It's the kind of layered, high-effort joke that sets this show apart from the rest of its subgenre, and it's just so nice to have it back.    If you've missed this runaway train of a show, there probably aren't enough creatively directed romantic mind games in the world to convince you at this point. But if you're already a fan who was just worried the magic might have run out after all this time, you've got nothing to worry about. Kaguya-sama is back and in championship form once again.

News Live-Action Koi ni Mudaguchi Series Unveils Visual, More Cast   posted on 2022-04-08 02:30 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Ryūhei Ueshima, Takigawa Akapen, Mone Akitani join cast; Banjou Ginga narrates    The official website for the live-action series of Ryoko Fukuyama's Koi ni Mudaguchi (Chatter About Love) manga revealed the visual and additional cast for the series on Thursday.     Veteran voice actor Banjou Ginga will narrate the series. Comedian Ryūhei Ueshima, Takigawa Akapen, and Mone Akitani are also joining the cast. Ueshima plays an original character named Morimi, a school janitor who always watches over the four boys from afar. Akapen plays Terakado, the butler of Maya, one of the boys who always wants to solve their problems by throwing money at it. Akitani plays Nakamura, the manga club president, and Ema's confidante that always gives her accurate advice.    The show will star So Okuno, Rintaro Mizusawa, Eito Konishi, and Maito Fujioka as Nishina, Maya, Shiro, and Aoi, respectively. The additional cast members include Yui Oguri as Ema, Rio Teramoto as Meri, Noa Tsurushima as Reika Tsunde, and Rinka Ōtani as Amane.    Natsu Hashimoto, Tomohiro Ōtoshi, and Ruri Hyōdō are writing the scripts, and Junta Yamaguchi, Ayuta Yoshikawa, and Miyako Yasojima are directing the series. KANA-BOON will perform the theme song ""Merry Go Round."" The series will premiere on TV Asahi on April 16, and on ABC TV on April 17. The show will stream on TELASA, TVer, and GYAO! in Japan.    Fukuyama launched the manga in Hakusensha's Hana to Yume magazine in September 2019. Hakusensha published the seventh volume on March 18.    The romantic comedy manga centers on four foolish young men who are wasting their youths. The four young men have only their good looks going for them, and they enroll in a school that used to be an all-girls school. They start a club called the ""Preserving Intangible Cultural Heritage"" club, but its nickname is the ""Pointless Club."" Every day at the club they just sit around idly talking about trivial matters.    Fukuyama launched the Anonymous Noise manga in Hana to Yume in April 2013, and ended the series in January 2019. Viz Media has released the manga in English.    A 12-episode television anime adaptation of the manga premiered in Japan in April 2017. Sentai Filmworks licensed the anime and streamed it on Amazon's now-defunct Anime Strike service in the United States. Crunchyroll streamed the series outside of the United States. Sentai Filmworks released the series on home video with an English dub in June 2018, and HIDIVE began streaming the show's English dub in the same month.    A live-action film adaptation of the manga premiered in Japan in November 2017.    Fukyama also launched the Kikenai Yoru wa Nai (The Unhearing Nights are Dead) manga in Young Animal Zero in September 2019, and the series is ongoing.

News Live-Action Koi ni Mudaguchi Series Unveils Visual, More Cast   posted on 2022-04-08 02:30 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Ryūhei Ueshima, Takigawa Akapen, Mone Akitani join cast; Banjou Ginga narrates    The official website for the live-action series of Ryoko Fukuyama's Koi ni Mudaguchi (Chatter About Love) manga revealed the visual and additional cast for the series on Thursday.     Veteran voice actor Banjou Ginga will narrate the series. Comedian Ryūhei Ueshima, Takigawa Akapen, and Mone Akitani are also joining the cast. Ueshima plays an original character named Morimi, a school janitor who always watches over the four boys from afar. Akapen plays Terakado, the butler of Maya, one of the boys who always wants to solve their problems by throwing money at it. Akitani plays Nakamura, the manga club president, and Ema's confidante that always gives her accurate advice.    The show will star So Okuno, Rintaro Mizusawa, Eito Konishi, and Maito Fujioka as Nishina, Maya, Shiro, and Aoi, respectively. The additional cast members include Yui Oguri as Ema, Rio Teramoto as Meri, Noa Tsurushima as Reika Tsunde, and Rinka Ōtani as Amane.    Natsu Hashimoto, Tomohiro Ōtoshi, and Ruri Hyōdō are writing the scripts, and Junta Yamaguchi, Ayuta Yoshikawa, and Miyako Yasojima are directing the series. KANA-BOON will perform the theme song ""Merry Go Round."" The series will premiere on TV Asahi on April 16, and on ABC TV on April 17. The show will stream on TELASA, TVer, and GYAO! in Japan.    Fukuyama launched the manga in Hakusensha's Hana to Yume magazine in September 2019. Hakusensha published the seventh volume on March 18.    The romantic comedy manga centers on four foolish young men who are wasting their youths. The four young men have only their good looks going for them, and they enroll in a school that used to be an all-girls school. They start a club called the ""Preserving Intangible Cultural Heritage"" club, but its nickname is the ""Pointless Club."" Every day at the club they just sit around idly talking about trivial matters.    Fukuyama launched the Anonymous Noise manga in Hana to Yume in April 2013, and ended the series in January 2019. Viz Media has released the manga in English.    A 12-episode television anime adaptation of the manga premiered in Japan in April 2017. Sentai Filmworks licensed the anime and streamed it on Amazon's now-defunct Anime Strike service in the United States. Crunchyroll streamed the series outside of the United States. Sentai Filmworks released the series on home video with an English dub in June 2018, and HIDIVE began streaming the show's English dub in the same month.    A live-action film adaptation of the manga premiered in Japan in November 2017.    Fukyama also launched the Kikenai Yoru wa Nai (The Unhearing Nights are Dead) manga in Young Animal Zero in September 2019, and the series is ongoing.

Veteran voice actor Banjou Ginga will narrate the series. Comedian Ryūhei Ueshima, Takigawa Akapen, and Mone Akitani are also joining the cast. Ueshima plays an original character named Morimi, a school janitor who always watches over the four boys from afar. Akapen plays Terakado, the butler of Maya, one of the boys who always wants to solve their problems by throwing money at it. Akitani plays Nakamura, the manga club president, and Ema's confidante that always gives her accurate advice.    The show will star So Okuno, Rintaro Mizusawa, Eito Konishi, and Maito Fujioka as Nishina, Maya, Shiro, and Aoi, respectively. The additional cast members include Yui Oguri as Ema, Rio Teramoto as Meri, Noa Tsurushima as Reika Tsunde, and Rinka Ōtani as Amane.    Natsu Hashimoto, Tomohiro Ōtoshi, and Ruri Hyōdō are writing the scripts, and Junta Yamaguchi, Ayuta Yoshikawa, and Miyako Yasojima are directing the series. KANA-BOON will perform the theme song ""Merry Go Round."" The series will premiere on TV Asahi on April 16, and on ABC TV on April 17. The show will stream on TELASA, TVer, and GYAO! in Japan.    Fukuyama launched the manga in Hakusensha's Hana to Yume magazine in September 2019. Hakusensha published the seventh volume on March 18.    The romantic comedy manga centers on four foolish young men who are wasting their youths. The four young men have only their good looks going for them, and they enroll in a school that used to be an all-girls school. They start a club called the ""Preserving Intangible Cultural Heritage"" club, but its nickname is the ""Pointless Club."" Every day at the club they just sit around idly talking about trivial matters.    Fukuyama launched the Anonymous Noise manga in Hana to Yume in April 2013, and ended the series in January 2019. Viz Media has released the manga in English.    A 12-episode television anime adaptation of the manga premiered in Japan in April 2017. Sentai Filmworks licensed the anime and streamed it on Amazon's now-defunct Anime Strike service in the United States. Crunchyroll streamed the series outside of the United States. Sentai Filmworks released the series on home video with an English dub in June 2018, and HIDIVE began streaming the show's English dub in the same month.    A live-action film adaptation of the manga premiered in Japan in November 2017.    Fukyama also launched the Kikenai Yoru wa Nai (The Unhearing Nights are Dead) manga in Young Animal Zero in September 2019, and the series is ongoing.

News Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   posted on 2022-04-09 07:57 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday    Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.       The tagline on the visual reads,  “I'll see you later.”       The film's still shows Suzume from behind, walking to what appears to be a small former hot springs town. ""A ryokan-style inn lies derelict and abandoned, the rooms overrun with curling ivy, signs pitted and rusted…"" The teaser video for the film will debut on the TOHO Movie channel on YouTube on Sunday, April 10 at 8:00 p.m. (7:00 a.m. EDT).    ""We must think about how to close the many doors we left open,"" says Shinkai as he continues work on the film. ""I've bestowed that responsibility upon Suzume as she travels across Japan closing various doors. It is my sincere hope that this film leaves its audiences with big smiles and excitement as they walk out of the theater.""     Shinkai describes Suzume no Tojimari as a modern adventure story, an action film, and a road movie. The story follows Suzume, a 17-year-old girl from a quiet Kyūshū town who meets a young man looking for a door. They find a door within ruins in the mountain, and Suzume opens it. Soon, more doors begin to open around Japan, bringing disasters from the other side. The film depicts Suzume's liberation and growth, as she closes the doors that are causing disaster.    The stars The sunset The morning sky  Within that realm, it was as though all time had melted together in the sky— Drawn in by this mysterious door, Suzume's journey is about to begin.   Shinkai stated that three important points about the film are that it is a road movie around Japan, a story about ""closing doors"" rather than opening them, and a reason to visit the movie theater. He elaborated that closing doors can refer to tying loose ends or finishing something.    Shinkai is directing the film and writing the screenplay. He is also credited with the original story. Masayoshi Tanaka (your name., Weathering With You) is designing the characters. Kenichi Tsuchiya (your name., Garden of Words) is the animation director. Takumi Tanji (Children Who Chase Lost Voices) is the art director. CoMix Wave Films and Story Inc. are producing the movie. TOHO is distributing the film.    The staff planned out the project from January to March of 2020, developed the script from April to August of that year, and drafted the storyboards from September 2020 to December 2021. The actual animation production began in April 20221 and is continuing up to now.    Shinkai's most recent film, Weathering With You, opened in Japan in July 2019. The film became the #7 highest-earning domestic film of all time in Japan (now #8 after Demon Slayer – Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Mugen Train), and was the highest-grossing film in Japan in 2019.    Shinkai's your name. film opened in Japan in August 2016, and has become the fifth highest-grossing film of all time in Japan, the third highest-grossing Japanese film, and the third highest-grossing anime film.    Shinkai's other works include 5 Centimeters Per Second, Voices of a Distant Star, She and Her Cat, The Place Promised in Our Early Days, The Garden of Words, and Children Who Chase Lost Voices.

Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 Episode 12  by James Beckett, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Teasing Master Takagi-san (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.8             Wow. Given how absolutely wonderful this third season of Teasing Master Takagi-san has been, I was trying to keep my expectations as low-key as possible going into this finale. There's a shiny new theatrical release on its way, after all, so I figured that the show would save its biggest romantic revelations for the big screen. Now, it's true that we don't technically get a confession this week, so that Takagi-san movie still has some ammo left in its pocket to work with, but that doesn't prevent “March 14th” from being one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime. Even if we didn't have a movie to look forward to, and this final episode of Season 3 was the last we were ever going to see of Nishikata and Takagi, I would have walked away from Teasing Master Takagi-san feeling completely satisfied. To steal a phrase from New Girl's Schmidt: “No notes!” First of all, it is impossible to understate how gosh darned adorable it is to see Nishikata slowly-but-surely piece together his own feelings for Takagi after Hamaguchi tries to pressure him into confessing to Takagi. At first, of course, Nishikata feels like there is no way that he feels anything other than a friendly (but fierce) rivalry towards the girl who teases him so much, and his elaborately designed “Nishikata Quest” is going to be the ultimate test of Takagi's mental fortitude against his. It's just pure, platonic friendship that is fueling Nishikata's urge to spend inordinate amounts of time arranging elaborate scavenger hunts for the girl he spends nearly every minute of his free time with…right? Sure, he does like hanging out with Takagi, and he can admit that she's pretty cute…and his heart starts to sink when he realizes she's not around to play the usual games with him in class…and he was so excited to see her face when she discovered the game-to-end-all-games that he made just for her… That alone would have been enough to dial my heart's Melt-o-Meter™ to dangerously high levels, but then the show actually goes out of its way to bring back the sneaky love confession that Takagi gave with that book she was teasing Nishikata with all the way back in Episode 2. Nishikata learns that there certainly wasn't an oddly specific and direct love confession for Takagi to read in the text of the book, and if that was Takagi trying to stealthily communicate her true feelings for Nishikata, then maybe the dozens of other times she's pulled similar stunts have also been…. (Dear readers, let me tell you that watching the truth of it all slowly dawn on our precious idiot's face has been one of the anime highlights of the past who-knows-how-long for me. I can only thank the Anime Gods that text reviews are incapable of transmitting the embarrassing noises I was making for half of this episode).  Also, can we talk for a moment about how incredible of a boyfriend Nishikata is going to be once he realizes that he's already been dating Takagi for, like, two years now? Nishikata may have been able to fool himself into thinking that “Nishikata Quest” was nothing more than an attempt to finally one-up his lifelong rival, but you and I (and the Girl Squad!) all know that his insanely elaborate scavenger hunt is one of the most romantic gestures imaginable, and if I had just one completely petty complaint to make about “March 14th”, it is that we have to settle for watching Mina and Co. solve all of the puzzles instead of Takagi herself. Yes, I am fully aware that the sight of Takagi falling in love with Nishikata all over again as she played Nishikata Quest would likely have fully killed me, or at the very least sent me into a shock-induced coma, but dammit, that's a risk I'm willing to take! I need this, Takagi-san! Ah well. I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time. Could I maybe nitpick a little about how some of the running animation looks a little off, or how the general timing of the scene feels just a little bit stretched out? Sure, I could…if I was a monster that hated love and art. I am not a monster, though, so instead I will simply revel in the simple joy that comes from watching two sweet kids get one step closer to expressing how much they love each other. Sure, Nishikata might not say “I love you” in this finale, but he doesn't need to. All Takagi needs to hear is that the boy of her dreams wanted nothing more than to see her, and to give her a small token of appreciation, because she really does mean the world to him.  That's more than enough for me. Whatever comes next for Teasing Master Takagi-san is just icing on the cake. What we've got here, already, is maybe about as close to a perfect anime love story is you can get. Rating:                 Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 is currently streaming on HIDIVE.

Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 Episode 12  by James Beckett, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Teasing Master Takagi-san (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.8             Wow. Given how absolutely wonderful this third season of Teasing Master Takagi-san has been, I was trying to keep my expectations as low-key as possible going into this finale. There's a shiny new theatrical release on its way, after all, so I figured that the show would save its biggest romantic revelations for the big screen. Now, it's true that we don't technically get a confession this week, so that Takagi-san movie still has some ammo left in its pocket to work with, but that doesn't prevent “March 14th” from being one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime. Even if we didn't have a movie to look forward to, and this final episode of Season 3 was the last we were ever going to see of Nishikata and Takagi, I would have walked away from Teasing Master Takagi-san feeling completely satisfied. To steal a phrase from New Girl's Schmidt: “No notes!” First of all, it is impossible to understate how gosh darned adorable it is to see Nishikata slowly-but-surely piece together his own feelings for Takagi after Hamaguchi tries to pressure him into confessing to Takagi. At first, of course, Nishikata feels like there is no way that he feels anything other than a friendly (but fierce) rivalry towards the girl who teases him so much, and his elaborately designed “Nishikata Quest” is going to be the ultimate test of Takagi's mental fortitude against his. It's just pure, platonic friendship that is fueling Nishikata's urge to spend inordinate amounts of time arranging elaborate scavenger hunts for the girl he spends nearly every minute of his free time with…right? Sure, he does like hanging out with Takagi, and he can admit that she's pretty cute…and his heart starts to sink when he realizes she's not around to play the usual games with him in class…and he was so excited to see her face when she discovered the game-to-end-all-games that he made just for her… That alone would have been enough to dial my heart's Melt-o-Meter™ to dangerously high levels, but then the show actually goes out of its way to bring back the sneaky love confession that Takagi gave with that book she was teasing Nishikata with all the way back in Episode 2. Nishikata learns that there certainly wasn't an oddly specific and direct love confession for Takagi to read in the text of the book, and if that was Takagi trying to stealthily communicate her true feelings for Nishikata, then maybe the dozens of other times she's pulled similar stunts have also been…. (Dear readers, let me tell you that watching the truth of it all slowly dawn on our precious idiot's face has been one of the anime highlights of the past who-knows-how-long for me. I can only thank the Anime Gods that text reviews are incapable of transmitting the embarrassing noises I was making for half of this episode).  Also, can we talk for a moment about how incredible of a boyfriend Nishikata is going to be once he realizes that he's already been dating Takagi for, like, two years now? Nishikata may have been able to fool himself into thinking that “Nishikata Quest” was nothing more than an attempt to finally one-up his lifelong rival, but you and I (and the Girl Squad!) all know that his insanely elaborate scavenger hunt is one of the most romantic gestures imaginable, and if I had just one completely petty complaint to make about “March 14th”, it is that we have to settle for watching Mina and Co. solve all of the puzzles instead of Takagi herself. Yes, I am fully aware that the sight of Takagi falling in love with Nishikata all over again as she played Nishikata Quest would likely have fully killed me, or at the very least sent me into a shock-induced coma, but dammit, that's a risk I'm willing to take! I need this, Takagi-san! Ah well. I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time. Could I maybe nitpick a little about how some of the running animation looks a little off, or how the general timing of the scene feels just a little bit stretched out? Sure, I could…if I was a monster that hated love and art. I am not a monster, though, so instead I will simply revel in the simple joy that comes from watching two sweet kids get one step closer to expressing how much they love each other. Sure, Nishikata might not say “I love you” in this finale, but he doesn't need to. All Takagi needs to hear is that the boy of her dreams wanted nothing more than to see her, and to give her a small token of appreciation, because she really does mean the world to him.  That's more than enough for me. Whatever comes next for Teasing Master Takagi-san is just icing on the cake. What we've got here, already, is maybe about as close to a perfect anime love story is you can get. Rating:                 Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 is currently streaming on HIDIVE.

Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 Episode 12  by James Beckett, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Teasing Master Takagi-san (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.8             Wow. Given how absolutely wonderful this third season of Teasing Master Takagi-san has been, I was trying to keep my expectations as low-key as possible going into this finale. There's a shiny new theatrical release on its way, after all, so I figured that the show would save its biggest romantic revelations for the big screen. Now, it's true that we don't technically get a confession this week, so that Takagi-san movie still has some ammo left in its pocket to work with, but that doesn't prevent “March 14th” from being one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime. Even if we didn't have a movie to look forward to, and this final episode of Season 3 was the last we were ever going to see of Nishikata and Takagi, I would have walked away from Teasing Master Takagi-san feeling completely satisfied. To steal a phrase from New Girl's Schmidt: “No notes!” First of all, it is impossible to understate how gosh darned adorable it is to see Nishikata slowly-but-surely piece together his own feelings for Takagi after Hamaguchi tries to pressure him into confessing to Takagi. At first, of course, Nishikata feels like there is no way that he feels anything other than a friendly (but fierce) rivalry towards the girl who teases him so much, and his elaborately designed “Nishikata Quest” is going to be the ultimate test of Takagi's mental fortitude against his. It's just pure, platonic friendship that is fueling Nishikata's urge to spend inordinate amounts of time arranging elaborate scavenger hunts for the girl he spends nearly every minute of his free time with…right? Sure, he does like hanging out with Takagi, and he can admit that she's pretty cute…and his heart starts to sink when he realizes she's not around to play the usual games with him in class…and he was so excited to see her face when she discovered the game-to-end-all-games that he made just for her… That alone would have been enough to dial my heart's Melt-o-Meter™ to dangerously high levels, but then the show actually goes out of its way to bring back the sneaky love confession that Takagi gave with that book she was teasing Nishikata with all the way back in Episode 2. Nishikata learns that there certainly wasn't an oddly specific and direct love confession for Takagi to read in the text of the book, and if that was Takagi trying to stealthily communicate her true feelings for Nishikata, then maybe the dozens of other times she's pulled similar stunts have also been…. (Dear readers, let me tell you that watching the truth of it all slowly dawn on our precious idiot's face has been one of the anime highlights of the past who-knows-how-long for me. I can only thank the Anime Gods that text reviews are incapable of transmitting the embarrassing noises I was making for half of this episode).  Also, can we talk for a moment about how incredible of a boyfriend Nishikata is going to be once he realizes that he's already been dating Takagi for, like, two years now? Nishikata may have been able to fool himself into thinking that “Nishikata Quest” was nothing more than an attempt to finally one-up his lifelong rival, but you and I (and the Girl Squad!) all know that his insanely elaborate scavenger hunt is one of the most romantic gestures imaginable, and if I had just one completely petty complaint to make about “March 14th”, it is that we have to settle for watching Mina and Co. solve all of the puzzles instead of Takagi herself. Yes, I am fully aware that the sight of Takagi falling in love with Nishikata all over again as she played Nishikata Quest would likely have fully killed me, or at the very least sent me into a shock-induced coma, but dammit, that's a risk I'm willing to take! I need this, Takagi-san! Ah well. I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time. Could I maybe nitpick a little about how some of the running animation looks a little off, or how the general timing of the scene feels just a little bit stretched out? Sure, I could…if I was a monster that hated love and art. I am not a monster, though, so instead I will simply revel in the simple joy that comes from watching two sweet kids get one step closer to expressing how much they love each other. Sure, Nishikata might not say “I love you” in this finale, but he doesn't need to. All Takagi needs to hear is that the boy of her dreams wanted nothing more than to see her, and to give her a small token of appreciation, because she really does mean the world to him.  That's more than enough for me. Whatever comes next for Teasing Master Takagi-san is just icing on the cake. What we've got here, already, is maybe about as close to a perfect anime love story is you can get. Rating:                 Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 is currently streaming on HIDIVE.

To steal a phrase from New Girl's Schmidt: “No notes!” First of all, it is impossible to understate how gosh darned adorable it is to see Nishikata slowly-but-surely piece together his own feelings for Takagi after Hamaguchi tries to pressure him into confessing to Takagi. At first, of course, Nishikata feels like there is no way that he feels anything other than a friendly (but fierce) rivalry towards the girl who teases him so much, and his elaborately designed “Nishikata Quest” is going to be the ultimate test of Takagi's mental fortitude against his. It's just pure, platonic friendship that is fueling Nishikata's urge to spend inordinate amounts of time arranging elaborate scavenger hunts for the girl he spends nearly every minute of his free time with…right? Sure, he does like hanging out with Takagi, and he can admit that she's pretty cute…and his heart starts to sink when he realizes she's not around to play the usual games with him in class…and he was so excited to see her face when she discovered the game-to-end-all-games that he made just for her… That alone would have been enough to dial my heart's Melt-o-Meter™ to dangerously high levels, but then the show actually goes out of its way to bring back the sneaky love confession that Takagi gave with that book she was teasing Nishikata with all the way back in Episode 2. Nishikata learns that there certainly wasn't an oddly specific and direct love confession for Takagi to read in the text of the book, and if that was Takagi trying to stealthily communicate her true feelings for Nishikata, then maybe the dozens of other times she's pulled similar stunts have also been…. (Dear readers, let me tell you that watching the truth of it all slowly dawn on our precious idiot's face has been one of the anime highlights of the past who-knows-how-long for me. I can only thank the Anime Gods that text reviews are incapable of transmitting the embarrassing noises I was making for half of this episode).  Also, can we talk for a moment about how incredible of a boyfriend Nishikata is going to be once he realizes that he's already been dating Takagi for, like, two years now? Nishikata may have been able to fool himself into thinking that “Nishikata Quest” was nothing more than an attempt to finally one-up his lifelong rival, but you and I (and the Girl Squad!) all know that his insanely elaborate scavenger hunt is one of the most romantic gestures imaginable, and if I had just one completely petty complaint to make about “March 14th”, it is that we have to settle for watching Mina and Co. solve all of the puzzles instead of Takagi herself. Yes, I am fully aware that the sight of Takagi falling in love with Nishikata all over again as she played Nishikata Quest would likely have fully killed me, or at the very least sent me into a shock-induced coma, but dammit, that's a risk I'm willing to take! I need this, Takagi-san! Ah well. I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time. Could I maybe nitpick a little about how some of the running animation looks a little off, or how the general timing of the scene feels just a little bit stretched out? Sure, I could…if I was a monster that hated love and art. I am not a monster, though, so instead I will simply revel in the simple joy that comes from watching two sweet kids get one step closer to expressing how much they love each other. Sure, Nishikata might not say “I love you” in this finale, but he doesn't need to. All Takagi needs to hear is that the boy of her dreams wanted nothing more than to see her, and to give her a small token of appreciation, because she really does mean the world to him.  That's more than enough for me. Whatever comes next for Teasing Master Takagi-san is just icing on the cake.

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 27th 2022       Soul Eater - The Perfect Edition GN 4-6                      Synopsis:             Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.      Review:         Synopsis:        Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.     Review:            Volume four of The Perfect Edition sees Soul Eater in pure, shonen action mode. It's the classic setup of an evil villain waiting at the end of a gauntlet of enemies, with each of our major characters getting a battle against an established baddie as they duke it out for the fate of the world. The main event is the rematch between Maka, Soul, and the Ragnarok duo, and it's some Grade A shonen fighting goodness. While the various beats it hits are pretty standard, they're delivered with the series' signature style and Ohkubo's exaggerated choreography, and thus land with a ton of impact, especially once “mad” Maka takes over and delivers some of the goofiest creepy-cute faces ever put to page.    Though the fight itself ends on a bit of a let down. Much is made about Maka resonating with Soul and giving into the black blood, but that ends up not mattering much as the fight resolves in a classic power of friendship conclusion. Don't get me wrong: Crona's backstory is emotionally affecting, and Maka reaching out to them with unconditional compassion is probably the best character moment in the series so far. But it doesn't quite match the tension and personal stakes that led up to it, and it leaves the whole black blood storyline feeling anticlimactic when it should be a huge turning point.    But the star of the show here is the Kishin himself, as the rest of the cast predictably fail to prevent his awakening. The sequence of Free and Eruka approaching his resting place is the most palpable horror in the manga so far, and it's followed up by a gloriously gross sequence of body horror as the Kishin literally puts himself back together skin-first. In classic Big Bad fashion he crushes our heroes with barely a whisper, and the only downside is that his fight with Lord Death has to be cut short so we can set up for the next arc. Again, that's predictable for this kind of shonen story, but it's still a tiny bit deflating to close things out with the new, dangerous villain running away. This is also supposed to be a sample of what Lord Death is capable of himself, and it winds up a pretty underwhelming showing for the guy.    Fittingly, Volume 5 is all about establishing the new conflict, introducing new characters on both sides as Ashura's awakening stirs up the rest of the world. On the good guys side, we're introduced to three of Lord Death's other Death Scythe weapons, each with their own quirks and powers. And like much of Ohkubo's extended cast, they're a mixed bag to start, as we initially learn about them through their singular comedic gimmicks. Marie Mjolnir has a great design and likable personality, but she's also obsessed with finding a husband, and that joke gets old fast. Similarly, Justin Law is a great fighter and has an interesting backstory as a solo Demon Weapon who became a Death Scythe at just 13, but his joke about always having his earbuds in wears out its welcome in record time. Azusa Yumi has probably the coolest powers of any Weapon outside Tsubaki, but is defined as the by-the-books straightwoman of the group and doesn't get much to do initially. They're not terrible, but by the end of the volume I was really wishing to see them get serious and stop goofing around. This formula works well with the kids because we already know their personalities beyond the tired gimmicks, but it's a chore to get through with a ton of new people.    The real treats come with the new villains introduced. Ashura himself is still off in the distance, but his resurrection spurs the revival of Arachne, a powerful spider-themed witch who immediately steals any page she's on. Her subordinate weapon, Giriko, leaves a little to be desired, as he initially just feels like a meaner version of Free. But his chainsaw powers make for some wild fights that more than made up for his retread personality. Their diminutive old butler(?) Mr. Mosquito has a striking, cartoony design that makes him stand out among Ohkubo's other villains, and his condescending attitude towards Giriko breathes a lot of life to this new primary villain group. Add in Medusa returning – by possessing the body of an innocent little girl, no less – and we have a great new villain group even before the return of Mifune, who's been forced to fight on their side under threat to Angela's life.    The following volume is more scattered, as we now need to introduce a common goal for the sides to scrap over while Ashura remains a looming hypothetical threat. This comes in the form of a search for the Demon Tools, designed centuries ago by a mysterious sorcerer named Eibon and scattered across the world. Volume 6 is bookended with two different quests for these tools, and makes for some of the best action in the series so far.    Kid's skateboard race against an enchanted train across the desert is a real highlight. It's a fast-paced and unique action setpiece, coupled with a three-way fight between Kid and both Arachne and Medusa's cronies that works as great spectacle and a nice highlight for the main kid who had the least to do in the previous arc. The closing battle in a snowy maelstrom doesn't get a conclusion in this volume, but it's got a lot of great, classic shonen moments for some of the side cast. Sid and his partner Mira, along with Death Scythe Azusa, have a fantastic and tactical fight against Mifune that shows off Ohkubo's improved eye for melee combat, packed with lots of inventive twists involving both the snowy landscape and Sid's zombie body. Meanwhile a secondary team of DWMA students actually get to shine instead of Maka and co, which is always welcome in battle series with huge casts. The big, important fight is of course being saved for our main crew, but it's still nice that Kirikou and his team can show off their stuff for a bit.    Outside of the action, the forces of darkness are still active in other ways. Ashura's awakening is causing a stirring of madness among the general populous, and especially in Dr. Stein, who's slowly being consumed by his inner darkness. But the real kicker is when Medusa slithers back into Crona's life just as they're starting to make friends at DWMA, and convinces her abused child to betray them and become her spy inside the school. After the progress we saw Crona make after their fight with Maka, it's genuinely heartbreaking to see this backslide, retreating into the madness and fear that once defined their entire personhood. It's by far the most affecting character arc right now by miles, easily eclipsing the rather pat teamwork lessons Maka and Black Star deal with during a training chapter here.    Unfortunately there is one big, obnoxious zit on volume six's face, and its name is Excalibur. For reasons I can't comprehend, the story interrupts itself for a full-length comedy chapter about Hero, a total gag character, teaming up with Excalibur to take over the school and get revenge on everyone who looks down on him. As somebody who also loves committing to overlong comedic bits for the sole purpose of annoying the reader, I can at least appreciate the idea behind Excalibur, but that doesn't make his dialogue any less of a chore to sit through. Add in some much un-needed skirt flipping and boob groping jokes and you have a chapter comprising all the worst elements of Soul Eater here, breaking up the rising tension of its story and character arcs. Maybe this would have worked better in the original collected volumes, but with The Perfect Edition's expanded chapter count per-book, it absolutely kills the tension while reading the volume on its own.    Other than that blemish, these volumes represent a solid, if somewhat inconsistent, new arc for Soul Eater's overarching story. The biggest complaint – besides Excalibur – is that the expanding scope of the story leaves Maka and Soul feeling underutilized and out of focus. That's perhaps to be expected as a series with such a huge cast goes on, but after their partnership defined so much of the conflict before this, it feels like the series doesn't quite know what to do with them besides occasionally hinting at the return of the black blood demon. But on its own, this is an effective, often thrilling chunk of storytelling and offers some fantastic highlights.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Story : B+ Art : A  + Entertaining new villains, fantastic action highlights, Crona's arc is the most compelling drama in the series so far − Some anticlimactic finishes, new heroes take some time to warm up to, Excalibur is here            discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Atsushi Ohkubo   Full encyclopedia details aboutSoul Eater (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          14 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr 10, 07:52 14 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 27th 2022       Soul Eater - The Perfect Edition GN 4-6                      Synopsis:             Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.      Review:         Synopsis:        Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.     Review:            Volume four of The Perfect Edition sees Soul Eater in pure, shonen action mode. It's the classic setup of an evil villain waiting at the end of a gauntlet of enemies, with each of our major characters getting a battle against an established baddie as they duke it out for the fate of the world. The main event is the rematch between Maka, Soul, and the Ragnarok duo, and it's some Grade A shonen fighting goodness. While the various beats it hits are pretty standard, they're delivered with the series' signature style and Ohkubo's exaggerated choreography, and thus land with a ton of impact, especially once “mad” Maka takes over and delivers some of the goofiest creepy-cute faces ever put to page.    Though the fight itself ends on a bit of a let down. Much is made about Maka resonating with Soul and giving into the black blood, but that ends up not mattering much as the fight resolves in a classic power of friendship conclusion. Don't get me wrong: Crona's backstory is emotionally affecting, and Maka reaching out to them with unconditional compassion is probably the best character moment in the series so far. But it doesn't quite match the tension and personal stakes that led up to it, and it leaves the whole black blood storyline feeling anticlimactic when it should be a huge turning point.    But the star of the show here is the Kishin himself, as the rest of the cast predictably fail to prevent his awakening. The sequence of Free and Eruka approaching his resting place is the most palpable horror in the manga so far, and it's followed up by a gloriously gross sequence of body horror as the Kishin literally puts himself back together skin-first. In classic Big Bad fashion he crushes our heroes with barely a whisper, and the only downside is that his fight with Lord Death has to be cut short so we can set up for the next arc. Again, that's predictable for this kind of shonen story, but it's still a tiny bit deflating to close things out with the new, dangerous villain running away. This is also supposed to be a sample of what Lord Death is capable of himself, and it winds up a pretty underwhelming showing for the guy.    Fittingly, Volume 5 is all about establishing the new conflict, introducing new characters on both sides as Ashura's awakening stirs up the rest of the world. On the good guys side, we're introduced to three of Lord Death's other Death Scythe weapons, each with their own quirks and powers. And like much of Ohkubo's extended cast, they're a mixed bag to start, as we initially learn about them through their singular comedic gimmicks. Marie Mjolnir has a great design and likable personality, but she's also obsessed with finding a husband, and that joke gets old fast. Similarly, Justin Law is a great fighter and has an interesting backstory as a solo Demon Weapon who became a Death Scythe at just 13, but his joke about always having his earbuds in wears out its welcome in record time. Azusa Yumi has probably the coolest powers of any Weapon outside Tsubaki, but is defined as the by-the-books straightwoman of the group and doesn't get much to do initially. They're not terrible, but by the end of the volume I was really wishing to see them get serious and stop goofing around. This formula works well with the kids because we already know their personalities beyond the tired gimmicks, but it's a chore to get through with a ton of new people.    The real treats come with the new villains introduced. Ashura himself is still off in the distance, but his resurrection spurs the revival of Arachne, a powerful spider-themed witch who immediately steals any page she's on. Her subordinate weapon, Giriko, leaves a little to be desired, as he initially just feels like a meaner version of Free. But his chainsaw powers make for some wild fights that more than made up for his retread personality. Their diminutive old butler(?) Mr. Mosquito has a striking, cartoony design that makes him stand out among Ohkubo's other villains, and his condescending attitude towards Giriko breathes a lot of life to this new primary villain group. Add in Medusa returning – by possessing the body of an innocent little girl, no less – and we have a great new villain group even before the return of Mifune, who's been forced to fight on their side under threat to Angela's life.    The following volume is more scattered, as we now need to introduce a common goal for the sides to scrap over while Ashura remains a looming hypothetical threat. This comes in the form of a search for the Demon Tools, designed centuries ago by a mysterious sorcerer named Eibon and scattered across the world. Volume 6 is bookended with two different quests for these tools, and makes for some of the best action in the series so far.    Kid's skateboard race against an enchanted train across the desert is a real highlight. It's a fast-paced and unique action setpiece, coupled with a three-way fight between Kid and both Arachne and Medusa's cronies that works as great spectacle and a nice highlight for the main kid who had the least to do in the previous arc. The closing battle in a snowy maelstrom doesn't get a conclusion in this volume, but it's got a lot of great, classic shonen moments for some of the side cast. Sid and his partner Mira, along with Death Scythe Azusa, have a fantastic and tactical fight against Mifune that shows off Ohkubo's improved eye for melee combat, packed with lots of inventive twists involving both the snowy landscape and Sid's zombie body. Meanwhile a secondary team of DWMA students actually get to shine instead of Maka and co, which is always welcome in battle series with huge casts. The big, important fight is of course being saved for our main crew, but it's still nice that Kirikou and his team can show off their stuff for a bit.    Outside of the action, the forces of darkness are still active in other ways. Ashura's awakening is causing a stirring of madness among the general populous, and especially in Dr. Stein, who's slowly being consumed by his inner darkness. But the real kicker is when Medusa slithers back into Crona's life just as they're starting to make friends at DWMA, and convinces her abused child to betray them and become her spy inside the school. After the progress we saw Crona make after their fight with Maka, it's genuinely heartbreaking to see this backslide, retreating into the madness and fear that once defined their entire personhood. It's by far the most affecting character arc right now by miles, easily eclipsing the rather pat teamwork lessons Maka and Black Star deal with during a training chapter here.    Unfortunately there is one big, obnoxious zit on volume six's face, and its name is Excalibur. For reasons I can't comprehend, the story interrupts itself for a full-length comedy chapter about Hero, a total gag character, teaming up with Excalibur to take over the school and get revenge on everyone who looks down on him. As somebody who also loves committing to overlong comedic bits for the sole purpose of annoying the reader, I can at least appreciate the idea behind Excalibur, but that doesn't make his dialogue any less of a chore to sit through. Add in some much un-needed skirt flipping and boob groping jokes and you have a chapter comprising all the worst elements of Soul Eater here, breaking up the rising tension of its story and character arcs. Maybe this would have worked better in the original collected volumes, but with The Perfect Edition's expanded chapter count per-book, it absolutely kills the tension while reading the volume on its own.    Other than that blemish, these volumes represent a solid, if somewhat inconsistent, new arc for Soul Eater's overarching story. The biggest complaint – besides Excalibur – is that the expanding scope of the story leaves Maka and Soul feeling underutilized and out of focus. That's perhaps to be expected as a series with such a huge cast goes on, but after their partnership defined so much of the conflict before this, it feels like the series doesn't quite know what to do with them besides occasionally hinting at the return of the black blood demon. But on its own, this is an effective, often thrilling chunk of storytelling and offers some fantastic highlights.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Story : B+ Art : A  + Entertaining new villains, fantastic action highlights, Crona's arc is the most compelling drama in the series so far − Some anticlimactic finishes, new heroes take some time to warm up to, Excalibur is here            discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Atsushi Ohkubo   Full encyclopedia details aboutSoul Eater (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          14 comments       Makoto Shinkai Unveils New Anime Film Suzume no Tojimari's Heroine, November 11 Opening   Apr 10, 07:52 14 comments                 anime    Still also posted before teaser's debut on Sunday ― Makoto Shinkai (your name., Weathering With You) revealed the title heroine's visual, a still, and the November 11 opening for his first new film in three years, Suzume no Tojimari (literally, Suzume's Door-Locking), on Saturday.

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 27th 2022       Soul Eater - The Perfect Edition GN 4-6                      Synopsis:             Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.      Review:         Synopsis:        Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.     Review:            Volume four of The Perfect Edition sees Soul Eater in pure, shonen action mode. It's the classic setup of an evil villain waiting at the end of a gauntlet of enemies, with each of our major characters getting a battle against an established baddie as they duke it out for the fate of the world. The main event is the rematch between Maka, Soul, and the Ragnarok duo, and it's some Grade A shonen fighting goodness. While the various beats it hits are pretty standard, they're delivered with the series' signature style and Ohkubo's exaggerated choreography, and thus land with a ton of impact, especially once “mad” Maka takes over and delivers some of the goofiest creepy-cute faces ever put to page.    Though the fight itself ends on a bit of a let down. Much is made about Maka resonating with Soul and giving into the black blood, but that ends up not mattering much as the fight resolves in a classic power of friendship conclusion. Don't get me wrong: Crona's backstory is emotionally affecting, and Maka reaching out to them with unconditional compassion is probably the best character moment in the series so far. But it doesn't quite match the tension and personal stakes that led up to it, and it leaves the whole black blood storyline feeling anticlimactic when it should be a huge turning point.    But the star of the show here is the Kishin himself, as the rest of the cast predictably fail to prevent his awakening. The sequence of Free and Eruka approaching his resting place is the most palpable horror in the manga so far, and it's followed up by a gloriously gross sequence of body horror as the Kishin literally puts himself back together skin-first. In classic Big Bad fashion he crushes our heroes with barely a whisper, and the only downside is that his fight with Lord Death has to be cut short so we can set up for the next arc. Again, that's predictable for this kind of shonen story, but it's still a tiny bit deflating to close things out with the new, dangerous villain running away. This is also supposed to be a sample of what Lord Death is capable of himself, and it winds up a pretty underwhelming showing for the guy.    Fittingly, Volume 5 is all about establishing the new conflict, introducing new characters on both sides as Ashura's awakening stirs up the rest of the world. On the good guys side, we're introduced to three of Lord Death's other Death Scythe weapons, each with their own quirks and powers. And like much of Ohkubo's extended cast, they're a mixed bag to start, as we initially learn about them through their singular comedic gimmicks. Marie Mjolnir has a great design and likable personality, but she's also obsessed with finding a husband, and that joke gets old fast. Similarly, Justin Law is a great fighter and has an interesting backstory as a solo Demon Weapon who became a Death Scythe at just 13, but his joke about always having his earbuds in wears out its welcome in record time. Azusa Yumi has probably the coolest powers of any Weapon outside Tsubaki, but is defined as the by-the-books straightwoman of the group and doesn't get much to do initially. They're not terrible, but by the end of the volume I was really wishing to see them get serious and stop goofing around. This formula works well with the kids because we already know their personalities beyond the tired gimmicks, but it's a chore to get through with a ton of new people.    The real treats come with the new villains introduced. Ashura himself is still off in the distance, but his resurrection spurs the revival of Arachne, a powerful spider-themed witch who immediately steals any page she's on. Her subordinate weapon, Giriko, leaves a little to be desired, as he initially just feels like a meaner version of Free. But his chainsaw powers make for some wild fights that more than made up for his retread personality. Their diminutive old butler(?) Mr. Mosquito has a striking, cartoony design that makes him stand out among Ohkubo's other villains, and his condescending attitude towards Giriko breathes a lot of life to this new primary villain group. Add in Medusa returning – by possessing the body of an innocent little girl, no less – and we have a great new villain group even before the return of Mifune, who's been forced to fight on their side under threat to Angela's life.    The following volume is more scattered, as we now need to introduce a common goal for the sides to scrap over while Ashura remains a looming hypothetical threat. This comes in the form of a search for the Demon Tools, designed centuries ago by a mysterious sorcerer named Eibon and scattered across the world. Volume 6 is bookended with two different quests for these tools, and makes for some of the best action in the series so far.    Kid's skateboard race against an enchanted train across the desert is a real highlight. It's a fast-paced and unique action setpiece, coupled with a three-way fight between Kid and both Arachne and Medusa's cronies that works as great spectacle and a nice highlight for the main kid who had the least to do in the previous arc. The closing battle in a snowy maelstrom doesn't get a conclusion in this volume, but it's got a lot of great, classic shonen moments for some of the side cast. Sid and his partner Mira, along with Death Scythe Azusa, have a fantastic and tactical fight against Mifune that shows off Ohkubo's improved eye for melee combat, packed with lots of inventive twists involving both the snowy landscape and Sid's zombie body. Meanwhile a secondary team of DWMA students actually get to shine instead of Maka and co, which is always welcome in battle series with huge casts. The big, important fight is of course being saved for our main crew, but it's still nice that Kirikou and his team can show off their stuff for a bit.    Outside of the action, the forces of darkness are still active in other ways. Ashura's awakening is causing a stirring of madness among the general populous, and especially in Dr. Stein, who's slowly being consumed by his inner darkness. But the real kicker is when Medusa slithers back into Crona's life just as they're starting to make friends at DWMA, and convinces her abused child to betray them and become her spy inside the school. After the progress we saw Crona make after their fight with Maka, it's genuinely heartbreaking to see this backslide, retreating into the madness and fear that once defined their entire personhood. It's by far the most affecting character arc right now by miles, easily eclipsing the rather pat teamwork lessons Maka and Black Star deal with during a training chapter here.    Unfortunately there is one big, obnoxious zit on volume six's face, and its name is Excalibur. For reasons I can't comprehend, the story interrupts itself for a full-length comedy chapter about Hero, a total gag character, teaming up with Excalibur to take over the school and get revenge on everyone who looks down on him. As somebody who also loves committing to overlong comedic bits for the sole purpose of annoying the reader, I can at least appreciate the idea behind Excalibur, but that doesn't make his dialogue any less of a chore to sit through. Add in some much un-needed skirt flipping and boob groping jokes and you have a chapter comprising all the worst elements of Soul Eater here, breaking up the rising tension of its story and character arcs. Maybe this would have worked better in the original collected volumes, but with The Perfect Edition's expanded chapter count per-book, it absolutely kills the tension while reading the volume on its own.    Other than that blemish, these volumes represent a solid, if somewhat inconsistent, new arc for Soul Eater's overarching story. The biggest complaint – besides Excalibur – is that the expanding scope of the story leaves Maka and Soul feeling underutilized and out of focus. That's perhaps to be expected as a series with such a huge cast goes on, but after their partnership defined so much of the conflict before this, it feels like the series doesn't quite know what to do with them besides occasionally hinting at the return of the black blood demon. But on its own, this is an effective, often thrilling chunk of storytelling and offers some fantastic highlights.
