Project Owners of AON Projects may offer their services as Rewards in exchange for Pledges, provided that such services do not involve Objectionable Content.  TOM may decline to provide any such services in its sole discretion.

A Project Owner may request that TOM administers the delivery of the applicable Rewards to, and/or otherwise provides necessary liaison services with, Backers in connection with its Projects.  The specific terms that relate to such services will be set forth in a separate written agreement between TOM and each such Project Owner.Backers.

Fees take effect once they are accessible through the link set forth in the first sentence of this Section 10.6.Cancellation. In cases where TOM is not the Project Owner, TOM reserves the right in its sole discretion to require a Project Owner to cancel any of its Projects for any or no reason upon notice, including, without limitation, in cases where the Project Owner has breached these Terms.  Upon any cancellation under this Section 10.7, the applicable Project Owner must promptly arrange for Pledges to be refunded to Backers.Disclaimer. THE FOLLOWING TERMS APPLY TO ANY PROJECT IN WHICH TOM IS NOT THE PROJECT OWNER: TOM MERELY PROVIDES A TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM THAT HELPS FACILITATE PROJECTS.

In the interest of resolving disputes between you and TOM in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and TOM agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Services will be resolved by binding arbitration.  Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.  Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.  This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Services, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.  YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND TOM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 19.1 above, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and TOM will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, ""AAA Rules"") of the American Arbitration Association (""AAA""), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.  The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting TOM.  The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by Mail (""Notice"").  TOM’s address for Notice is: Tokyo Otaku Mode Co. Ltd., Nagatacho GRID 2-5-3 Hirakawa-cho, Chiyoda-ku Tokyo, Japan 102-0093, Attn: Chief Executive Officer.  The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (""Demand"").  The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, then you or TOM may commence an arbitration proceeding.  During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or TOM must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.  If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor with a monetary award that exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by TOM prior to selection of an arbitrator, TOM will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by TOM in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $15,000.Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, then TOM will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.  Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Tokyo, Japan, but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, then you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.  If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse TOM for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.  Each party agrees that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award.  The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.No Class Actions. YOU AND TOM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  Further, unless both you and TOM agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, if TOM makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to TOM’s address for Notice, then you may reject the change by sending TOM written notice within 30 days of the change to TOM’s address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and TOM.Enforceability. If Section 19.6 above is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 19 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 19 will be null and void.MISCELLANEOUSGoverning Law; Entire Agreement. This is the entire agreement between you and TOM relating to the subject matter herein and supersedes all previous communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between the parties with respect to said subject matter.  These Terms shall not be modified except in a writing, signed by both parties, or by a change to these Terms made by TOM as authorized in these Terms.  These Terms will be governed solely by the laws of Japan, without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.  Waiver. A provision of these Terms may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the party entitled to the benefit of such provision.  The failure of TOM to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.Severability. If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Assignment. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by TOM without restriction.  Any assignment attempted to be made by you in violation of these Terms shall be void.  These Terms will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, and permitted successors and assigns.No Agency. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and TOM as a result of these Terms or use of the Services.Survival. The provisions of these Terms that are intended to survive the termination of these Terms by their nature will survive the termination of these Terms, including, but not limited to, Sections 4 (Privacy), 5 (Service Security), 7.4(d) (Survival of Rights for Removed User Content); 7.2-7.4 (Licenses), 8 (Monitoring and Removing Content; Reliance on User Content), 10 (Crowd-Sourced Projects), 11 (Prohibited Activities), 12 (Disclaimer of Content, Including User Content), 13 (Links to Third Party Sites), 14 (Indemnity), 15 (Additional Disclaimers), 16 (Limitations), 17 (Term and Termination), 19 (Dispute Resolution), and 20 (Miscellaneous).

Project Owners of AON Projects may offer their services as Rewards in exchange for Pledges, provided that such services do not involve Objectionable Content.

A Project Owner may request that TOM administers the delivery of the applicable Rewards to, and/or otherwise provides necessary liaison services with, Backers in connection with its Projects.  The specific terms that relate to such services will be set forth in a separate written agreement between TOM and each such Project Owner.Backers.

Fees take effect once they are accessible through the link set forth in the first sentence of this Section 10.6.Cancellation. In cases where TOM is not the Project Owner, TOM reserves the right in its sole discretion to require a Project Owner to cancel any of its Projects for any or no reason upon notice, including, without limitation, in cases where the Project Owner has breached these Terms.  Upon any cancellation under this Section 10.7, the applicable Project Owner must promptly arrange for Pledges to be refunded to Backers.Disclaimer. THE FOLLOWING TERMS APPLY TO ANY PROJECT IN WHICH TOM IS NOT THE PROJECT OWNER: TOM MERELY PROVIDES A TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM THAT HELPS FACILITATE PROJECTS.

In the interest of resolving disputes between you and TOM in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and TOM agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Services will be resolved by binding arbitration.  Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.  Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.  This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Services, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.  YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND TOM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 19.1 above, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and TOM will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, ""AAA Rules"") of the American Arbitration Association (""AAA""), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.  The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting TOM.  The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by Mail (""Notice"").  TOM’s address for Notice is: Tokyo Otaku Mode Co. Ltd., Nagatacho GRID 2-5-3 Hirakawa-cho, Chiyoda-ku Tokyo, Japan 102-0093, Attn: Chief Executive Officer.  The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (""Demand"").  The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, then you or TOM may commence an arbitration proceeding.  During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or TOM must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.  If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor with a monetary award that exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by TOM prior to selection of an arbitrator, TOM will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by TOM in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $15,000.Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, then TOM will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.  Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Tokyo, Japan, but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, then you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.  If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse TOM for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.  Each party agrees that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award.  The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.No Class Actions. YOU AND TOM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  Further, unless both you and TOM agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, if TOM makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to TOM’s address for Notice, then you may reject the change by sending TOM written notice within 30 days of the change to TOM’s address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and TOM.Enforceability. If Section 19.6 above is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 19 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 19 will be null and void.MISCELLANEOUSGoverning Law; Entire Agreement. This is the entire agreement between you and TOM relating to the subject matter herein and supersedes all previous communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between the parties with respect to said subject matter.  These Terms shall not be modified except in a writing, signed by both parties, or by a change to these Terms made by TOM as authorized in these Terms.  These Terms will be governed solely by the laws of Japan, without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.  Waiver. A provision of these Terms may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the party entitled to the benefit of such provision.  The failure of TOM to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.Severability. If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Assignment. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by TOM without restriction.  Any assignment attempted to be made by you in violation of these Terms shall be void.  These Terms will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, and permitted successors and assigns.No Agency. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and TOM as a result of these Terms or use of the Services.Survival. The provisions of these Terms that are intended to survive the termination of these Terms by their nature will survive the termination of these Terms, including, but not limited to, Sections 4 (Privacy), 5 (Service Security), 7.4(d) (Survival of Rights for Removed User Content); 7.2-7.4 (Licenses), 8 (Monitoring and Removing Content; Reliance on User Content), 10 (Crowd-Sourced Projects), 11 (Prohibited Activities), 12 (Disclaimer of Content, Including User Content), 13 (Links to Third Party Sites), 14 (Indemnity), 15 (Additional Disclaimers), 16 (Limitations), 17 (Term and Termination), 19 (Dispute Resolution), and 20 (Miscellaneous).

The specific terms that relate to such services will be set forth in a separate written agreement between TOM and each such Project Owner.Backers.

In cases where TOM is not the Project Owner, TOM reserves the right in its sole discretion to require a Project Owner to cancel any of its Projects for any or no reason upon notice, including, without limitation, in cases where the Project Owner has breached these Terms.  Upon any cancellation under this Section 10.7, the applicable Project Owner must promptly arrange for Pledges to be refunded to Backers.Disclaimer.

In the interest of resolving disputes between you and TOM in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and TOM agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Services will be resolved by binding arbitration.  Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.  Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.  This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Services, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.  YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND TOM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 19.1 above, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and TOM will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, ""AAA Rules"") of the American Arbitration Association (""AAA""), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.  The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting TOM.  The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by Mail (""Notice"").  TOM’s address for Notice is: Tokyo Otaku Mode Co. Ltd., Nagatacho GRID 2-5-3 Hirakawa-cho, Chiyoda-ku Tokyo, Japan 102-0093, Attn: Chief Executive Officer.  The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (""Demand"").  The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, then you or TOM may commence an arbitration proceeding.  During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or TOM must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.  If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor with a monetary award that exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by TOM prior to selection of an arbitrator, TOM will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by TOM in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $15,000.Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, then TOM will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.  Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Tokyo, Japan, but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, then you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.  If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse TOM for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.  Each party agrees that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award.  The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.No Class Actions. YOU AND TOM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  Further, unless both you and TOM agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, if TOM makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to TOM’s address for Notice, then you may reject the change by sending TOM written notice within 30 days of the change to TOM’s address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and TOM.Enforceability. If Section 19.6 above is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 19 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 19 will be null and void.MISCELLANEOUSGoverning Law; Entire Agreement. This is the entire agreement between you and TOM relating to the subject matter herein and supersedes all previous communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between the parties with respect to said subject matter.  These Terms shall not be modified except in a writing, signed by both parties, or by a change to these Terms made by TOM as authorized in these Terms.  These Terms will be governed solely by the laws of Japan, without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.  Waiver. A provision of these Terms may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the party entitled to the benefit of such provision.  The failure of TOM to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.Severability. If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Assignment. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by TOM without restriction.  Any assignment attempted to be made by you in violation of these Terms shall be void.  These Terms will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, and permitted successors and assigns.No Agency. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and TOM as a result of these Terms or use of the Services.Survival. The provisions of these Terms that are intended to survive the termination of these Terms by their nature will survive the termination of these Terms, including, but not limited to, Sections 4 (Privacy), 5 (Service Security), 7.4(d) (Survival of Rights for Removed User Content); 7.2-7.4 (Licenses), 8 (Monitoring and Removing Content; Reliance on User Content), 10 (Crowd-Sourced Projects), 11 (Prohibited Activities), 12 (Disclaimer of Content, Including User Content), 13 (Links to Third Party Sites), 14 (Indemnity), 15 (Additional Disclaimers), 16 (Limitations), 17 (Term and Termination), 19 (Dispute Resolution), and 20 (Miscellaneous).

A warning will be displayed before any spoilers are mentioned, so rest assured that you can read this article even if you haven’t watched it yet!Fantasy anime  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba has taken not only Japan, but the entire world by storm. On October 16, 2020, a sequel,  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train, was released in Japan. In just 10 days, it earned over 100 billion yen in box office revenues, the fastest movie to have ever done so in Japan, and the two month mark saw it go past a whopping 300 million yen. If that wasn't enough, it even overtook  Studio Ghibli's  Spirited Away, previously the highest-grossing film in Japanese history - yet another record set at blazing speeds!Along with this wave of popularity, manga volumes and general  KnY merchandise has been selling out everywhere. Regardless of age and gender, the franchise has truly attracted passionate fans far and wide.Penned by a TOM Staff member and true  KnY fan who’s gone to see  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train an unbelievable 16 times, this article will introduce nine of its highlights - in other words, nine reasons to go and watch it when it's available where you are. Get ready to engage in some Total Concentration Reading!First, let’s talk about the background behind  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train. The original manga,  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba, tells the story of Tanjiro Kamado, a boy who embarks on a quest to heal his sister Nezuko, who has been transformed into a demon. During this journey, he and his companions must face intense battles against evil demons.  Mugen Train covers the 7th and 8th volumes of the manga. In terms of the TV anime series, the movie follows on from the story of the 26th and last episode, “New Mission.” If you haven’t seen the TV anime yet, I recommend watching it first. For some quick information on the plot, setting, and key vocab, check out our guide to Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba!Now, watch closely… and pay attention to these highlights! 1. Unbelievably Beautiful VisualsWhen it first came out, the TV anime's stunning animation and breathtaking battle scenes went viral. Of course, these high standards were maintained in the movie as well. Seeing those amazing battle scenes on the big screen was particularly overwhelming! The sheer speed made me feel like I was running through the screen with Tanjiro and the others, while the ominous figures of their enemies, the demons, had me shivering… From the first scene of the advancing Mugen Train to the credits, you can dive right into the world of  KnY through the spectacular animation. And it’s not just the battle scenes – charming country landscapes, the train’s striking interior, snowy mountains, the Rengoku family’s traditional Japanese house… There’s just so much to enjoy in this amazing movie, produced by ufotable, a studio whose animation of katana and Japanese architechture has been well received in anime like  Touken Ranbu and much more. Be sure to look out for the backgrounds, too! Here’s a tip: each of the fusuma, or sliding doors, have especially elaborate designs.  2. The Flame Hashira: The One and Only Kyojuro RengokuOne thing I want – or actually, need you to pay attention to is the second protagonist of Mugen Train: Kyojuro Rengoku, the Demon Slayer Corps’ Flame Hashira. Many people may have been surprised at Kyojuro’s first appearance in the anime series – the moment he lays eyes upon Nezuko, already a demon, and Tanjiro, who brought her, he orders that she be decapitated. This paints him as quite an unreasonable person who won’t even stop for an explanation first, but we go on to learn so much more about him. A son of the Rengoku family and its historic Fire Hashira lineage, we see his gentle soul, strength, and unwavering heart and convictions, as well as the loneliness that follows a man of his nature. All of this is sure to draw you to him as a character. At the beginning of Episode 24 of the anime series, Kyojuro is seen talking with Shinobu Kocho (the Insect Hashira) about his upcoming mission on the Mugen Train. He didn’t receive any battle scenes during the series, so the movie is the first time we actually get to see him and his Flame Breathing techniques in action. The flames that roar through the train, his unbelievably swift reactions, the movement of his cape, his intense red eyes that seem to see through all…Everything. Is. Way. Too. Cool.Seriously, everything about him is just so cool… How am I meant to deal with this… (I mean, I don’t have to.) The moment he began his Flame Breathing First Form: Shiranui, I realized, “Oh, I’ve pretty much spent nothing on this movie… This is already worth the ticket…”From his sword techniques to his mere presence and words, every part of Rengoku Kyojuro is priceless. Honestly, this movie leaves you no time to even blink. Everything is something to look out for. I don’t want you to let even a tenth of a second escape your attention, so be sure to use plenty of eye drops before it starts 3. The Mugen Train and its Real-Life OriginsLet’s take a look at a certain train otaku favorite in Japan, SL Hitoyoshi, which features an 8620 Class steam locomotive. Commonly known as “hachiroku"" (meaning ""86”), it’s none other than the locomotive that inspired the appearance of the Mugen Train! From the beginning of the movie, we get plenty of glimpses at Japan in the Taisho Era (1912-1926), from the design of the station and passenger cars to the fashion of the passengers themselves. Through the animation, we also experience its sheer speed, as well as the actual sensation of being swayed as we ride in the heavy carriages. It’s downright awesome!Here in Japan, we actually got to see a collaboration between SL Hitoyoshi and  KnY, where the locomotive was transformed into a real-life Mugen Train for a limited run. Naturally, it was so popular that it was practically impossible to get your hands on tickets. (Yup, I didn’t manage to snag any either…) It quickly became a viral topic on social media, with people excited to see a “real-life Mugen Train” even in photos and videos.  4. Tanjiro’s Feelings For His FamilyKnY’s story begins with a powerful theme: family. We also see its importance in the movie, which beautifully illustrates Tanjiro’s feelings for his family. He’s already lost so many people important to him, but no matter how much he wants to return to those happy days, there’s no going back – he'll never be able to see his loved ones again. This movie’s depiction of Tanjiro’s family, entangled in memories both happy and sad, but never to be restored, will have your eyes streaming with tears. 5. And Of Course, the Funny Scenes!Another great element that we get to see again are the hilarious moments between Inosuke and Zenitsu! You’ll also find yourself chuckling at Rengoku as he scarfs down his ekiben (bento lunches bought at train stations). Another heads up – at first Zenitsu’s dream sequence will probably just seem funny, but if you pay attention to where it’s set, that smile might turn into tears… (This is especially aimed at anyone who’s already read the manga up to the Mugen Train arc – I want you to think long and hard about where he is in that dream!) Spoiler Alert!From here, I’ll be introducing specific details about the movie, so please stop reading if you want to avoid spoilers.↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓Alright! Let’s keep going with more highlights, including actual scenes from the movie! 6. An Unprecedented Battle of IntellectTanjiro’s new foe, and the demon controlling the Mugen Train is Enmu, Lower Rank One in the Twelve Kizuki. Before the events of the movie, Muzan himself took a liking to Enmu and gifted him with Muzan’s blood. Having gained power with this infusion, Enmu decides to enlist the help of humans – or rather, use them as a means for his plan. Thus, the lives of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, Nezuko, and their mission companion, Rengoku, as well as the train’s many regular passengers, are Enmu’s next targets. His gentle and calm manner of speaking and friendly smile prove to make him an even more sinister character. Carrying out his plan with meticulous care, Enmu attempts to put Tanjiro and the other humans to sleep forever through his Blood Demon Art, a style of attack that they’ve never faced before. How will Tanjiro and his fellow Demon Slayers wake themselves up from Enmu’s eternal dreams? 7. The Sudden Appearance of Upper Rank Three, AkazaThe last part of the movie takes a huge turn with the sudden appearance of Akaza (Upper Rank Three) and his fierce battle against Rengoku. Just before dawn, Tanjiro and the others finally get the chance to breathe a sigh of relief, having defeated Enmu and checked that the passengers are safe. But this only lasts for a moment, with the Demon Slayers gathered facing the dreaded Upper Rank Three for the first time. The sudden roaring sound signals the appearance of something... but then dies down, leaving an eerie silence. Then, a pair of eyes glisten in the darkness. This frightening sense of anticipation crosses the screen to weigh down on you, causing you to instinctively clench your fists in suspense…Despite Akaza being a favorite among  KnY’s many demons, we didn’t get any information on his voice actor, or even still images until the movie’s official release. As a result, fans speculated that the movie might only cover Enmu’s arc and stop before showing Akaza, or that the anime series would continue with his story. However, the movie’s premiere date came and the cat was finally let out of the bag. We now know that Akaza’s voice actor is Akira Ishida, famous for roles like Kaworu Nagisa in  Neon Genesis Evangelion! This casting was a huge yet welcome surprise for fans. If you’re watching the movie with Japanese audio, be sure to soak up every moment of Akaza’s malevolence, madness and despair through Ishida’s formidable voice acting!One more highlight is the overwhelming energy of Rengoku and Akaza in their battle scenes, yet another part where you can’t afford to blink. If IMAX screenings are available near you, take advantage of them and experience the fight’s sheer power at full volume. It goes without saying that you can still experience plenty at normal theaters, but I urge you to go and feel the huge impact behind each and every hit at IMAX volume levels! The depiction of the snowflake patterns in Akaza’s Technique Deployment ability is also a highlight. In the original manga’s 18th volume, we learn about Akaza’s past. Despite being a ruthless demon with numerous victims, the sorrows of his life as a human capture the pity of readers. Personally, he’s one of my favorite characters. After watching the movie, I also recommend going right to the rest of the manga to continue the story! 8. Tears of FrustrationAt the end of the battle, Tanjiro and his companions are overwhelmed by the realization that they are still too weak, no matter how much work they put in or how hard they train. Sneering down with their seemingly infinite power are the demons. Haunted by the thought that they couldn’t do anything, that they had to be protected by others, the young humans have faced frustration, sadness, and uncontrollable tears. For the sake of their slain family members and beloved people they still had to protect, they’ve trained over and over, fought to survive the Final Selection, narrowly escaped death every night, and made huge progress. Yet their power was still nowhere near enough. And now, the man they had followed has fallen victim to their enemies. No matter how many times you watch the movie, this realization will tear your heart to shreds. In the face of such a tragedy, Inosuke offers some words that are deeply touching. His upbringing among wild boars may have given him less experience with other people, but we can see that he’s grown yet again as a human.  9. Rengoku’s Explosive Battle Through LifeFans who have already read the manga will know what I’m talking about. In any case, I won’t elaborate too much, but I urge you to burn his battles and his way of life into your mind – why he risks his life in battle, why he tries to protect humans. His crystal-clear beliefs and promises will also give you an insight into the loneliness he must bear. Protect the weak. Respect one’s duty and values. In what light will you see these warriors and hear their words as they fight to protect others? If you have the chance, please find out on the big screen. Finally, let me leave you with these words: “Keep your heart burning!” (And don’t forget a handkerchief!)This is a Tokyo Otaku Mode original article with text and illustrations by HER.--Need some more quality time with the KnY crew?

Commonly known as “hachiroku"" (meaning ""86”), it’s none other than the locomotive that inspired the appearance of the Mugen Train! From the beginning of the movie, we get plenty of glimpses at Japan in the Taisho Era (1912-1926), from the design of the station and passenger cars to the fashion of the passengers themselves. Through the animation, we also experience its sheer speed, as well as the actual sensation of being swayed as we ride in the heavy carriages. It’s downright awesome!Here in Japan, we actually got to see a collaboration between SL Hitoyoshi and  KnY, where the locomotive was transformed into a real-life Mugen Train for a limited run. Naturally, it was so popular that it was practically impossible to get your hands on tickets. (Yup, I didn’t manage to snag any either…) It quickly became a viral topic on social media, with people excited to see a “real-life Mugen Train” even in photos and videos.  4. Tanjiro’s Feelings For His FamilyKnY’s story begins with a powerful theme: family. We also see its importance in the movie, which beautifully illustrates Tanjiro’s feelings for his family. He’s already lost so many people important to him, but no matter how much he wants to return to those happy days, there’s no going back – he'll never be able to see his loved ones again. This movie’s depiction of Tanjiro’s family, entangled in memories both happy and sad, but never to be restored, will have your eyes streaming with tears. 5. And Of Course, the Funny Scenes!Another great element that we get to see again are the hilarious moments between Inosuke and Zenitsu! You’ll also find yourself chuckling at Rengoku as he scarfs down his ekiben (bento lunches bought at train stations). Another heads up – at first Zenitsu’s dream sequence will probably just seem funny, but if you pay attention to where it’s set, that smile might turn into tears… (This is especially aimed at anyone who’s already read the manga up to the Mugen Train arc – I want you to think long and hard about where he is in that dream!) Spoiler Alert!From here, I’ll be introducing specific details about the movie, so please stop reading if you want to avoid spoilers.↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓Alright! Let’s keep going with more highlights, including actual scenes from the movie! 6. An Unprecedented Battle of IntellectTanjiro’s new foe, and the demon controlling the Mugen Train is Enmu, Lower Rank One in the Twelve Kizuki. Before the events of the movie, Muzan himself took a liking to Enmu and gifted him with Muzan’s blood. Having gained power with this infusion, Enmu decides to enlist the help of humans – or rather, use them as a means for his plan. Thus, the lives of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, Nezuko, and their mission companion, Rengoku, as well as the train’s many regular passengers, are Enmu’s next targets. His gentle and calm manner of speaking and friendly smile prove to make him an even more sinister character. Carrying out his plan with meticulous care, Enmu attempts to put Tanjiro and the other humans to sleep forever through his Blood Demon Art, a style of attack that they’ve never faced before. How will Tanjiro and his fellow Demon Slayers wake themselves up from Enmu’s eternal dreams? 7. The Sudden Appearance of Upper Rank Three, AkazaThe last part of the movie takes a huge turn with the sudden appearance of Akaza (Upper Rank Three) and his fierce battle against Rengoku. Just before dawn, Tanjiro and the others finally get the chance to breathe a sigh of relief, having defeated Enmu and checked that the passengers are safe. But this only lasts for a moment, with the Demon Slayers gathered facing the dreaded Upper Rank Three for the first time. The sudden roaring sound signals the appearance of something... but then dies down, leaving an eerie silence. Then, a pair of eyes glisten in the darkness. This frightening sense of anticipation crosses the screen to weigh down on you, causing you to instinctively clench your fists in suspense…Despite Akaza being a favorite among  KnY’s many demons, we didn’t get any information on his voice actor, or even still images until the movie’s official release. As a result, fans speculated that the movie might only cover Enmu’s arc and stop before showing Akaza, or that the anime series would continue with his story. However, the movie’s premiere date came and the cat was finally let out of the bag. We now know that Akaza’s voice actor is Akira Ishida, famous for roles like Kaworu Nagisa in  Neon Genesis Evangelion! This casting was a huge yet welcome surprise for fans. If you’re watching the movie with Japanese audio, be sure to soak up every moment of Akaza’s malevolence, madness and despair through Ishida’s formidable voice acting!One more highlight is the overwhelming energy of Rengoku and Akaza in their battle scenes, yet another part where you can’t afford to blink. If IMAX screenings are available near you, take advantage of them and experience the fight’s sheer power at full volume. It goes without saying that you can still experience plenty at normal theaters, but I urge you to go and feel the huge impact behind each and every hit at IMAX volume levels! The depiction of the snowflake patterns in Akaza’s Technique Deployment ability is also a highlight. In the original manga’s 18th volume, we learn about Akaza’s past. Despite being a ruthless demon with numerous victims, the sorrows of his life as a human capture the pity of readers. Personally, he’s one of my favorite characters. After watching the movie, I also recommend going right to the rest of the manga to continue the story! 8. Tears of FrustrationAt the end of the battle, Tanjiro and his companions are overwhelmed by the realization that they are still too weak, no matter how much work they put in or how hard they train. Sneering down with their seemingly infinite power are the demons. Haunted by the thought that they couldn’t do anything, that they had to be protected by others, the young humans have faced frustration, sadness, and uncontrollable tears. For the sake of their slain family members and beloved people they still had to protect, they’ve trained over and over, fought to survive the Final Selection, narrowly escaped death every night, and made huge progress. Yet their power was still nowhere near enough. And now, the man they had followed has fallen victim to their enemies. No matter how many times you watch the movie, this realization will tear your heart to shreds. In the face of such a tragedy, Inosuke offers some words that are deeply touching. His upbringing among wild boars may have given him less experience with other people, but we can see that he’s grown yet again as a human.  9. Rengoku’s Explosive Battle Through LifeFans who have already read the manga will know what I’m talking about. In any case, I won’t elaborate too much, but I urge you to burn his battles and his way of life into your mind – why he risks his life in battle, why he tries to protect humans. His crystal-clear beliefs and promises will also give you an insight into the loneliness he must bear. Protect the weak. Respect one’s duty and values. In what light will you see these warriors and hear their words as they fight to protect others? If you have the chance, please find out on the big screen.

A warning will be displayed before any spoilers are mentioned, so rest assured that you can read this article even if you haven’t watched it yet!Fantasy anime  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba has taken not only Japan, but the entire world by storm. On October 16, 2020, a sequel,  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train, was released in Japan. In just 10 days, it earned over 100 billion yen in box office revenues, the fastest movie to have ever done so in Japan, and the two month mark saw it go past a whopping 300 million yen. If that wasn't enough, it even overtook  Studio Ghibli's  Spirited Away, previously the highest-grossing film in Japanese history - yet another record set at blazing speeds!Along with this wave of popularity, manga volumes and general  KnY merchandise has been selling out everywhere. Regardless of age and gender, the franchise has truly attracted passionate fans far and wide.Penned by a TOM Staff member and true  KnY fan who’s gone to see  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train an unbelievable 16 times, this article will introduce nine of its highlights - in other words, nine reasons to go and watch it when it's available where you are. Get ready to engage in some Total Concentration Reading!First, let’s talk about the background behind  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train. The original manga,  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba, tells the story of Tanjiro Kamado, a boy who embarks on a quest to heal his sister Nezuko, who has been transformed into a demon. During this journey, he and his companions must face intense battles against evil demons.  Mugen Train covers the 7th and 8th volumes of the manga. In terms of the TV anime series, the movie follows on from the story of the 26th and last episode, “New Mission.” If you haven’t seen the TV anime yet, I recommend watching it first. For some quick information on the plot, setting, and key vocab, check out our guide to Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba!Now, watch closely… and pay attention to these highlights! 1. Unbelievably Beautiful VisualsWhen it first came out, the TV anime's stunning animation and breathtaking battle scenes went viral. Of course, these high standards were maintained in the movie as well. Seeing those amazing battle scenes on the big screen was particularly overwhelming! The sheer speed made me feel like I was running through the screen with Tanjiro and the others, while the ominous figures of their enemies, the demons, had me shivering… From the first scene of the advancing Mugen Train to the credits, you can dive right into the world of  KnY through the spectacular animation. And it’s not just the battle scenes – charming country landscapes, the train’s striking interior, snowy mountains, the Rengoku family’s traditional Japanese house… There’s just so much to enjoy in this amazing movie, produced by ufotable, a studio whose animation of katana and Japanese architechture has been well received in anime like  Touken Ranbu and much more. Be sure to look out for the backgrounds, too! Here’s a tip: each of the fusuma, or sliding doors, have especially elaborate designs.  2. The Flame Hashira: The One and Only Kyojuro RengokuOne thing I want – or actually, need you to pay attention to is the second protagonist of Mugen Train: Kyojuro Rengoku, the Demon Slayer Corps’ Flame Hashira. Many people may have been surprised at Kyojuro’s first appearance in the anime series – the moment he lays eyes upon Nezuko, already a demon, and Tanjiro, who brought her, he orders that she be decapitated. This paints him as quite an unreasonable person who won’t even stop for an explanation first, but we go on to learn so much more about him. A son of the Rengoku family and its historic Fire Hashira lineage, we see his gentle soul, strength, and unwavering heart and convictions, as well as the loneliness that follows a man of his nature. All of this is sure to draw you to him as a character. At the beginning of Episode 24 of the anime series, Kyojuro is seen talking with Shinobu Kocho (the Insect Hashira) about his upcoming mission on the Mugen Train. He didn’t receive any battle scenes during the series, so the movie is the first time we actually get to see him and his Flame Breathing techniques in action. The flames that roar through the train, his unbelievably swift reactions, the movement of his cape, his intense red eyes that seem to see through all…Everything. Is. Way. Too. Cool.Seriously, everything about him is just so cool… How am I meant to deal with this… (I mean, I don’t have to.) The moment he began his Flame Breathing First Form: Shiranui, I realized, “Oh, I’ve pretty much spent nothing on this movie… This is already worth the ticket…”From his sword techniques to his mere presence and words, every part of Rengoku Kyojuro is priceless. Honestly, this movie leaves you no time to even blink. Everything is something to look out for. I don’t want you to let even a tenth of a second escape your attention, so be sure to use plenty of eye drops before it starts 3. The Mugen Train and its Real-Life OriginsLet’s take a look at a certain train otaku favorite in Japan, SL Hitoyoshi, which features an 8620 Class steam locomotive.

An Unprecedented Battle of IntellectTanjiro’s new foe, and the demon controlling the Mugen Train is Enmu, Lower Rank One in the Twelve Kizuki.

The Sudden Appearance of Upper Rank Three, AkazaThe last part of the movie takes a huge turn with the sudden appearance of Akaza (Upper Rank Three) and his fierce battle against Rengoku. Just before dawn, Tanjiro and the others finally get the chance to breathe a sigh of relief, having defeated Enmu and checked that the passengers are safe. But this only lasts for a moment, with the Demon Slayers gathered facing the dreaded Upper Rank Three for the first time. The sudden roaring sound signals the appearance of something... but then dies down, leaving an eerie silence. Then, a pair of eyes glisten in the darkness. This frightening sense of anticipation crosses the screen to weigh down on you, causing you to instinctively clench your fists in suspense…Despite Akaza being a favorite among  KnY’s many demons, we didn’t get any information on his voice actor, or even still images until the movie’s official release. As a result, fans speculated that the movie might only cover Enmu’s arc and stop before showing Akaza, or that the anime series would continue with his story. However, the movie’s premiere date came and the cat was finally let out of the bag. We now know that Akaza’s voice actor is Akira Ishida, famous for roles like Kaworu Nagisa in  Neon Genesis Evangelion! This casting was a huge yet welcome surprise for fans. If you’re watching the movie with Japanese audio, be sure to soak up every moment of Akaza’s malevolence, madness and despair through Ishida’s formidable voice acting!One more highlight is the overwhelming energy of Rengoku and Akaza in their battle scenes, yet another part where you can’t afford to blink. If IMAX screenings are available near you, take advantage of them and experience the fight’s sheer power at full volume. It goes without saying that you can still experience plenty at normal theaters, but I urge you to go and feel the huge impact behind each and every hit at IMAX volume levels! The depiction of the snowflake patterns in Akaza’s Technique Deployment ability is also a highlight. In the original manga’s 18th volume, we learn about Akaza’s past. Despite being a ruthless demon with numerous victims, the sorrows of his life as a human capture the pity of readers. Personally, he’s one of my favorite characters. After watching the movie, I also recommend going right to the rest of the manga to continue the story! 8. Tears of FrustrationAt the end of the battle, Tanjiro and his companions are overwhelmed by the realization that they are still too weak, no matter how much work they put in or how hard they train. Sneering down with their seemingly infinite power are the demons. Haunted by the thought that they couldn’t do anything, that they had to be protected by others, the young humans have faced frustration, sadness, and uncontrollable tears. For the sake of their slain family members and beloved people they still had to protect, they’ve trained over and over, fought to survive the Final Selection, narrowly escaped death every night, and made huge progress. Yet their power was still nowhere near enough. And now, the man they had followed has fallen victim to their enemies. No matter how many times you watch the movie, this realization will tear your heart to shreds. In the face of such a tragedy, Inosuke offers some words that are deeply touching. His upbringing among wild boars may have given him less experience with other people, but we can see that he’s grown yet again as a human.  9. Rengoku’s Explosive Battle Through LifeFans who have already read the manga will know what I’m talking about. In any case, I won’t elaborate too much, but I urge you to burn his battles and his way of life into your mind – why he risks his life in battle, why he tries to protect humans. His crystal-clear beliefs and promises will also give you an insight into the loneliness he must bear. Protect the weak. Respect one’s duty and values. In what light will you see these warriors and hear their words as they fight to protect others? If you have the chance, please find out on the big screen. Finally, let me leave you with these words: “Keep your heart burning!” (And don’t forget a handkerchief!)This is a Tokyo Otaku Mode original article with text and illustrations by HER.--Need some more quality time with the KnY crew?
