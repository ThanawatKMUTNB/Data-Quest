Review   by Caitlin Moore, Apr 18th 2022       The Orbital Children Streaming                     Synopsis:             Years ago, the most intelligent AI of all time, Seven, calculated that humanity had to be reduced by a third in order to prevent disaster. By the time the UN euthanized him, he had left behind a poem prophesying the future and a cult of followers known as John Doe. Also remaining were the seemingly defective implants he had designed to allow children born in space to survive past infancy. One of those children, Touya, is currently facing his own mortality at the age of 14 and harbors a deep resentment towards the people on Earth who destroyed the only being who could have understood how to repair the implant that may be slowly killing him. And now, he's supposed to play host to three teenagers who won a contest to come stay at the hotel/research facility where he lives.      Review:         Synopsis:        Years ago, the most intelligent AI of all time, Seven, calculated that humanity had to be reduced by a third in order to prevent disaster. By the time the UN euthanized him, he had left behind a poem prophesying the future and a cult of followers known as John Doe. Also remaining were the seemingly defective implants he had designed to allow children born in space to survive past infancy. One of those children, Touya, is currently facing his own mortality at the age of 14 and harbors a deep resentment towards the people on Earth who destroyed the only being who could have understood how to repair the implant that may be slowly killing him. And now, he's supposed to play host to three teenagers who won a contest to come stay at the hotel/research facility where he lives.     Review:            Fifteen years ago, the skilled animator Mitsuo Iso helmed Den-noh Coil, a science fiction tale about children interacting with and exploring the world through augmented reality glasses. It was the first time he was able to show off his incredible storytelling chops, and the show garnered a cult following that excitedly waited for his follow-up. And waited. And waited. And when it seemed like that next project would never come, The Orbital Children was announced. When it finally made its premiere, all those patient fans, myself included, gathered to see if it would live up to its predecessor. Although I can only speak for myself, I found Iso's sophomore series to be an overall worthy, if somewhat weaker, successor to his first great success.    In Orbital Children, Iso revisits many of Den-noh Coil's most prominent themes, particularly the way children interact with technology, and how technology interacts with human existence. The technology, including super-intelligent AI systems and space travel, is considerably more advanced, but the core ideas remain similar. Touya, an intelligent and troubled teenager, has lived his whole life in space and only survived infancy thanks to an implant designed by the super-intelligent AI being known as Seven. He appears apathetic towards other humans, actively resentful of the Earthlings who he feels signed his death warrant when they eliminated Seven – leaving a seemingly defective implant in his head –  and has more interest in playing with and experimenting on the AIs that help run the space station/hotel where he lives with his uncle.    It's a heavy subject and Orbital Children dives right in, immediately introducing the audience to Touya and his issues, alongside his fellow space-born child Konoha and Nasa Houston, the ship's doctor who is trying to figure out how to extend their lives. Their world gets shaken up by a trio of teenage contest winners arriving on their station, the Anshin, followed shortly by a meteor impact that cuts off most of their power and isolates them from most of the adults who run the Anshin as the station leaks air.    Although Netflix has the series split into six episodes, it was also planned as two movies, which divides the series tidily into a two-act structure. The first half plays out as a well-made space disaster movie, with a group of adolescents cut off from their guardians trying to figure out how to cooperate and survive on their own with limited resources or guidance. Cast chemistry is essential to these scenarios, as the way the characters play off each other is the main source of both tension and relief. Orbital Children does well here, with its core cast of four adolescents and one young adult. The misanthropic Touya plays well off of Taiyou, an over-eager young white-hat hacker, and their immediate rivalry is fun and nails how two 14-year-olds with competing interests and no adult supervision would behave in their situation.    The second group – made up of the spacetuber Mina livestreaming the experience, her younger brother Hiroshi, Nasa, and Konoha – is somewhat less dynamic, and doesn't really come alive until they join back up with Taiyou and Touya. Mina is a lot of fun as a teenage influencer obsessed with gaining views, but Hiroshi doesn't really get a lot to do narratively and Konoha is mostly there to be ethereal and act as a plot device in the second half.    In the latter half, Orbital Children shifts away from a straightforward space survival story and toward the metaphysical, exploring the nature of AI and just what happened when Seven entered its lunatic phase, composed the Song of Seven, and was subsequently euthanized. One of the reasons it was taken offline was because it called for over a third of humanity to be eliminated to ensure the planet and its species' survival. Iso does not shy away from asking difficult and relevant questions: are “human” and “humanity” separate concepts? Must we sacrifice humans to save humanity?    These themes have been present in fiction for a long time, and have only felt more sharply relevant as time has gone on, so it's no wonder Iso wanted to explore them in his own way. It's honestly very interesting, especially tied in with the concept of “lunatic” artificial intelligence that is so advanced that it becomes almost godlike. However, there are certain elements that pulled me out a bit. I found myself frustrated that Konoha never really came into her own as a character, especially surrounded by big personalities like Touya, Taiyou, and Mina. Certain elements wrapped up too conveniently, essentially robbing the characters of their free will that weakened, rather than strengthened, the story. I can't help but think the story would have been stronger as a full-length TV series, giving the story and characters more time to play in the space that has been created for them, even if it weren't as tightly plotted.    Technically, it's still a strong effort. One of my favorite things about Den-noh Coil was how the characters were written and animated like actual children their age, and that has carried through to Orbital Children as well. Each character has a sense of physicality distinct from the others, but still within believability for their age group. The animation looks great, including even the space station setting, with a lot of thought put into just what a tourist-friendly space station would look like. There's some clunky CG that doesn't quite blend with the hand-drawn elements, but that's a relatively minor issue that doesn't come up as often as one would think.    As is often the case with Netflix releases, the series is available both in its original Japanese and dubbed into a number of languages. I can only speak to the Japanese and English versions, but both are strong and viewers should pick according to their preferences, though Cassandra Lee Morris is more or less wasted as the soft-spoken Konoha.    Despite its flaws, The Orbital Children is an excellent series, far and away one of the best anime series of the year so far. It's a must-watch for fans of Den-noh Coil, and a strong recommendation to pretty much everyone else. Now to start waiting for Iso's third series!

Review   by Caitlin Moore, Apr 18th 2022       The Orbital Children Streaming                     Synopsis:             Years ago, the most intelligent AI of all time, Seven, calculated that humanity had to be reduced by a third in order to prevent disaster. By the time the UN euthanized him, he had left behind a poem prophesying the future and a cult of followers known as John Doe. Also remaining were the seemingly defective implants he had designed to allow children born in space to survive past infancy. One of those children, Touya, is currently facing his own mortality at the age of 14 and harbors a deep resentment towards the people on Earth who destroyed the only being who could have understood how to repair the implant that may be slowly killing him. And now, he's supposed to play host to three teenagers who won a contest to come stay at the hotel/research facility where he lives.      Review:         Synopsis:        Years ago, the most intelligent AI of all time, Seven, calculated that humanity had to be reduced by a third in order to prevent disaster. By the time the UN euthanized him, he had left behind a poem prophesying the future and a cult of followers known as John Doe. Also remaining were the seemingly defective implants he had designed to allow children born in space to survive past infancy. One of those children, Touya, is currently facing his own mortality at the age of 14 and harbors a deep resentment towards the people on Earth who destroyed the only being who could have understood how to repair the implant that may be slowly killing him. And now, he's supposed to play host to three teenagers who won a contest to come stay at the hotel/research facility where he lives.     Review:            Fifteen years ago, the skilled animator Mitsuo Iso helmed Den-noh Coil, a science fiction tale about children interacting with and exploring the world through augmented reality glasses. It was the first time he was able to show off his incredible storytelling chops, and the show garnered a cult following that excitedly waited for his follow-up. And waited. And waited. And when it seemed like that next project would never come, The Orbital Children was announced. When it finally made its premiere, all those patient fans, myself included, gathered to see if it would live up to its predecessor. Although I can only speak for myself, I found Iso's sophomore series to be an overall worthy, if somewhat weaker, successor to his first great success.    In Orbital Children, Iso revisits many of Den-noh Coil's most prominent themes, particularly the way children interact with technology, and how technology interacts with human existence. The technology, including super-intelligent AI systems and space travel, is considerably more advanced, but the core ideas remain similar. Touya, an intelligent and troubled teenager, has lived his whole life in space and only survived infancy thanks to an implant designed by the super-intelligent AI being known as Seven. He appears apathetic towards other humans, actively resentful of the Earthlings who he feels signed his death warrant when they eliminated Seven – leaving a seemingly defective implant in his head –  and has more interest in playing with and experimenting on the AIs that help run the space station/hotel where he lives with his uncle.    It's a heavy subject and Orbital Children dives right in, immediately introducing the audience to Touya and his issues, alongside his fellow space-born child Konoha and Nasa Houston, the ship's doctor who is trying to figure out how to extend their lives. Their world gets shaken up by a trio of teenage contest winners arriving on their station, the Anshin, followed shortly by a meteor impact that cuts off most of their power and isolates them from most of the adults who run the Anshin as the station leaks air.    Although Netflix has the series split into six episodes, it was also planned as two movies, which divides the series tidily into a two-act structure. The first half plays out as a well-made space disaster movie, with a group of adolescents cut off from their guardians trying to figure out how to cooperate and survive on their own with limited resources or guidance. Cast chemistry is essential to these scenarios, as the way the characters play off each other is the main source of both tension and relief. Orbital Children does well here, with its core cast of four adolescents and one young adult. The misanthropic Touya plays well off of Taiyou, an over-eager young white-hat hacker, and their immediate rivalry is fun and nails how two 14-year-olds with competing interests and no adult supervision would behave in their situation.    The second group – made up of the spacetuber Mina livestreaming the experience, her younger brother Hiroshi, Nasa, and Konoha – is somewhat less dynamic, and doesn't really come alive until they join back up with Taiyou and Touya. Mina is a lot of fun as a teenage influencer obsessed with gaining views, but Hiroshi doesn't really get a lot to do narratively and Konoha is mostly there to be ethereal and act as a plot device in the second half.    In the latter half, Orbital Children shifts away from a straightforward space survival story and toward the metaphysical, exploring the nature of AI and just what happened when Seven entered its lunatic phase, composed the Song of Seven, and was subsequently euthanized. One of the reasons it was taken offline was because it called for over a third of humanity to be eliminated to ensure the planet and its species' survival. Iso does not shy away from asking difficult and relevant questions: are “human” and “humanity” separate concepts? Must we sacrifice humans to save humanity?    These themes have been present in fiction for a long time, and have only felt more sharply relevant as time has gone on, so it's no wonder Iso wanted to explore them in his own way. It's honestly very interesting, especially tied in with the concept of “lunatic” artificial intelligence that is so advanced that it becomes almost godlike. However, there are certain elements that pulled me out a bit. I found myself frustrated that Konoha never really came into her own as a character, especially surrounded by big personalities like Touya, Taiyou, and Mina. Certain elements wrapped up too conveniently, essentially robbing the characters of their free will that weakened, rather than strengthened, the story. I can't help but think the story would have been stronger as a full-length TV series, giving the story and characters more time to play in the space that has been created for them, even if it weren't as tightly plotted.    Technically, it's still a strong effort. One of my favorite things about Den-noh Coil was how the characters were written and animated like actual children their age, and that has carried through to Orbital Children as well. Each character has a sense of physicality distinct from the others, but still within believability for their age group. The animation looks great, including even the space station setting, with a lot of thought put into just what a tourist-friendly space station would look like. There's some clunky CG that doesn't quite blend with the hand-drawn elements, but that's a relatively minor issue that doesn't come up as often as one would think.    As is often the case with Netflix releases, the series is available both in its original Japanese and dubbed into a number of languages. I can only speak to the Japanese and English versions, but both are strong and viewers should pick according to their preferences, though Cassandra Lee Morris is more or less wasted as the soft-spoken Konoha.    Despite its flaws, The Orbital Children is an excellent series, far and away one of the best anime series of the year so far. It's a must-watch for fans of Den-noh Coil, and a strong recommendation to pretty much everyone else. Now to start waiting for Iso's third series!

Review   by Caitlin Moore, Apr 18th 2022       The Orbital Children Streaming                     Synopsis:             Years ago, the most intelligent AI of all time, Seven, calculated that humanity had to be reduced by a third in order to prevent disaster. By the time the UN euthanized him, he had left behind a poem prophesying the future and a cult of followers known as John Doe. Also remaining were the seemingly defective implants he had designed to allow children born in space to survive past infancy. One of those children, Touya, is currently facing his own mortality at the age of 14 and harbors a deep resentment towards the people on Earth who destroyed the only being who could have understood how to repair the implant that may be slowly killing him. And now, he's supposed to play host to three teenagers who won a contest to come stay at the hotel/research facility where he lives.

One of those children, Touya, is currently facing his own mortality at the age of 14 and harbors a deep resentment towards the people on Earth who destroyed the only being who could have understood how to repair the implant that may be slowly killing him. And now, he's supposed to play host to three teenagers who won a contest to come stay at the hotel/research facility where he lives.     Review:            Fifteen years ago, the skilled animator Mitsuo Iso helmed Den-noh Coil, a science fiction tale about children interacting with and exploring the world through augmented reality glasses. It was the first time he was able to show off his incredible storytelling chops, and the show garnered a cult following that excitedly waited for his follow-up. And waited. And waited. And when it seemed like that next project would never come, The Orbital Children was announced. When it finally made its premiere, all those patient fans, myself included, gathered to see if it would live up to its predecessor. Although I can only speak for myself, I found Iso's sophomore series to be an overall worthy, if somewhat weaker, successor to his first great success.    In Orbital Children, Iso revisits many of Den-noh Coil's most prominent themes, particularly the way children interact with technology, and how technology interacts with human existence. The technology, including super-intelligent AI systems and space travel, is considerably more advanced, but the core ideas remain similar. Touya, an intelligent and troubled teenager, has lived his whole life in space and only survived infancy thanks to an implant designed by the super-intelligent AI being known as Seven. He appears apathetic towards other humans, actively resentful of the Earthlings who he feels signed his death warrant when they eliminated Seven – leaving a seemingly defective implant in his head –  and has more interest in playing with and experimenting on the AIs that help run the space station/hotel where he lives with his uncle.    It's a heavy subject and Orbital Children dives right in, immediately introducing the audience to Touya and his issues, alongside his fellow space-born child Konoha and Nasa Houston, the ship's doctor who is trying to figure out how to extend their lives. Their world gets shaken up by a trio of teenage contest winners arriving on their station, the Anshin, followed shortly by a meteor impact that cuts off most of their power and isolates them from most of the adults who run the Anshin as the station leaks air.    Although Netflix has the series split into six episodes, it was also planned as two movies, which divides the series tidily into a two-act structure. The first half plays out as a well-made space disaster movie, with a group of adolescents cut off from their guardians trying to figure out how to cooperate and survive on their own with limited resources or guidance. Cast chemistry is essential to these scenarios, as the way the characters play off each other is the main source of both tension and relief. Orbital Children does well here, with its core cast of four adolescents and one young adult. The misanthropic Touya plays well off of Taiyou, an over-eager young white-hat hacker, and their immediate rivalry is fun and nails how two 14-year-olds with competing interests and no adult supervision would behave in their situation.    The second group – made up of the spacetuber Mina livestreaming the experience, her younger brother Hiroshi, Nasa, and Konoha – is somewhat less dynamic, and doesn't really come alive until they join back up with Taiyou and Touya. Mina is a lot of fun as a teenage influencer obsessed with gaining views, but Hiroshi doesn't really get a lot to do narratively and Konoha is mostly there to be ethereal and act as a plot device in the second half.    In the latter half, Orbital Children shifts away from a straightforward space survival story and toward the metaphysical, exploring the nature of AI and just what happened when Seven entered its lunatic phase, composed the Song of Seven, and was subsequently euthanized. One of the reasons it was taken offline was because it called for over a third of humanity to be eliminated to ensure the planet and its species' survival. Iso does not shy away from asking difficult and relevant questions: are “human” and “humanity” separate concepts? Must we sacrifice humans to save humanity?    These themes have been present in fiction for a long time, and have only felt more sharply relevant as time has gone on, so it's no wonder Iso wanted to explore them in his own way. It's honestly very interesting, especially tied in with the concept of “lunatic” artificial intelligence that is so advanced that it becomes almost godlike. However, there are certain elements that pulled me out a bit. I found myself frustrated that Konoha never really came into her own as a character, especially surrounded by big personalities like Touya, Taiyou, and Mina. Certain elements wrapped up too conveniently, essentially robbing the characters of their free will that weakened, rather than strengthened, the story. I can't help but think the story would have been stronger as a full-length TV series, giving the story and characters more time to play in the space that has been created for them, even if it weren't as tightly plotted.    Technically, it's still a strong effort. One of my favorite things about Den-noh Coil was how the characters were written and animated like actual children their age, and that has carried through to Orbital Children as well. Each character has a sense of physicality distinct from the others, but still within believability for their age group. The animation looks great, including even the space station setting, with a lot of thought put into just what a tourist-friendly space station would look like. There's some clunky CG that doesn't quite blend with the hand-drawn elements, but that's a relatively minor issue that doesn't come up as often as one would think.    As is often the case with Netflix releases, the series is available both in its original Japanese and dubbed into a number of languages. I can only speak to the Japanese and English versions, but both are strong and viewers should pick according to their preferences, though Cassandra Lee Morris is more or less wasted as the soft-spoken Konoha.    Despite its flaws, The Orbital Children is an excellent series, far and away one of the best anime series of the year so far. It's a must-watch for fans of Den-noh Coil, and a strong recommendation to pretty much everyone else. Now to start waiting for Iso's third series!

Review   by Caitlin Moore, Apr 18th 2022       The Orbital Children Streaming                     Synopsis:             Years ago, the most intelligent AI of all time, Seven, calculated that humanity had to be reduced by a third in order to prevent disaster. By the time the UN euthanized him, he had left behind a poem prophesying the future and a cult of followers known as John Doe. Also remaining were the seemingly defective implants he had designed to allow children born in space to survive past infancy. One of those children, Touya, is currently facing his own mortality at the age of 14 and harbors a deep resentment towards the people on Earth who destroyed the only being who could have understood how to repair the implant that may be slowly killing him. And now, he's supposed to play host to three teenagers who won a contest to come stay at the hotel/research facility where he lives.

One of those children, Touya, is currently facing his own mortality at the age of 14 and harbors a deep resentment towards the people on Earth who destroyed the only being who could have understood how to repair the implant that may be slowly killing him. And now, he's supposed to play host to three teenagers who won a contest to come stay at the hotel/research facility where he lives.     Review:            Fifteen years ago, the skilled animator Mitsuo Iso helmed Den-noh Coil, a science fiction tale about children interacting with and exploring the world through augmented reality glasses. It was the first time he was able to show off his incredible storytelling chops, and the show garnered a cult following that excitedly waited for his follow-up. And waited. And waited. And when it seemed like that next project would never come, The Orbital Children was announced. When it finally made its premiere, all those patient fans, myself included, gathered to see if it would live up to its predecessor. Although I can only speak for myself, I found Iso's sophomore series to be an overall worthy, if somewhat weaker, successor to his first great success.    In Orbital Children, Iso revisits many of Den-noh Coil's most prominent themes, particularly the way children interact with technology, and how technology interacts with human existence. The technology, including super-intelligent AI systems and space travel, is considerably more advanced, but the core ideas remain similar. Touya, an intelligent and troubled teenager, has lived his whole life in space and only survived infancy thanks to an implant designed by the super-intelligent AI being known as Seven. He appears apathetic towards other humans, actively resentful of the Earthlings who he feels signed his death warrant when they eliminated Seven – leaving a seemingly defective implant in his head –  and has more interest in playing with and experimenting on the AIs that help run the space station/hotel where he lives with his uncle.    It's a heavy subject and Orbital Children dives right in, immediately introducing the audience to Touya and his issues, alongside his fellow space-born child Konoha and Nasa Houston, the ship's doctor who is trying to figure out how to extend their lives. Their world gets shaken up by a trio of teenage contest winners arriving on their station, the Anshin, followed shortly by a meteor impact that cuts off most of their power and isolates them from most of the adults who run the Anshin as the station leaks air.    Although Netflix has the series split into six episodes, it was also planned as two movies, which divides the series tidily into a two-act structure. The first half plays out as a well-made space disaster movie, with a group of adolescents cut off from their guardians trying to figure out how to cooperate and survive on their own with limited resources or guidance. Cast chemistry is essential to these scenarios, as the way the characters play off each other is the main source of both tension and relief. Orbital Children does well here, with its core cast of four adolescents and one young adult. The misanthropic Touya plays well off of Taiyou, an over-eager young white-hat hacker, and their immediate rivalry is fun and nails how two 14-year-olds with competing interests and no adult supervision would behave in their situation.    The second group – made up of the spacetuber Mina livestreaming the experience, her younger brother Hiroshi, Nasa, and Konoha – is somewhat less dynamic, and doesn't really come alive until they join back up with Taiyou and Touya. Mina is a lot of fun as a teenage influencer obsessed with gaining views, but Hiroshi doesn't really get a lot to do narratively and Konoha is mostly there to be ethereal and act as a plot device in the second half.    In the latter half, Orbital Children shifts away from a straightforward space survival story and toward the metaphysical, exploring the nature of AI and just what happened when Seven entered its lunatic phase, composed the Song of Seven, and was subsequently euthanized. One of the reasons it was taken offline was because it called for over a third of humanity to be eliminated to ensure the planet and its species' survival. Iso does not shy away from asking difficult and relevant questions: are “human” and “humanity” separate concepts? Must we sacrifice humans to save humanity?    These themes have been present in fiction for a long time, and have only felt more sharply relevant as time has gone on, so it's no wonder Iso wanted to explore them in his own way. It's honestly very interesting, especially tied in with the concept of “lunatic” artificial intelligence that is so advanced that it becomes almost godlike. However, there are certain elements that pulled me out a bit. I found myself frustrated that Konoha never really came into her own as a character, especially surrounded by big personalities like Touya, Taiyou, and Mina. Certain elements wrapped up too conveniently, essentially robbing the characters of their free will that weakened, rather than strengthened, the story. I can't help but think the story would have been stronger as a full-length TV series, giving the story and characters more time to play in the space that has been created for them, even if it weren't as tightly plotted.    Technically, it's still a strong effort. One of my favorite things about Den-noh Coil was how the characters were written and animated like actual children their age, and that has carried through to Orbital Children as well. Each character has a sense of physicality distinct from the others, but still within believability for their age group. The animation looks great, including even the space station setting, with a lot of thought put into just what a tourist-friendly space station would look like. There's some clunky CG that doesn't quite blend with the hand-drawn elements, but that's a relatively minor issue that doesn't come up as often as one would think.    As is often the case with Netflix releases, the series is available both in its original Japanese and dubbed into a number of languages. I can only speak to the Japanese and English versions, but both are strong and viewers should pick according to their preferences, though Cassandra Lee Morris is more or less wasted as the soft-spoken Konoha.    Despite its flaws, The Orbital Children is an excellent series, far and away one of the best anime series of the year so far. It's a must-watch for fans of Den-noh Coil, and a strong recommendation to pretty much everyone else. Now to start waiting for Iso's third series!

Each character has a sense of physicality distinct from the others, but still within believability for their age group. The animation looks great, including even the space station setting, with a lot of thought put into just what a tourist-friendly space station would look like. There's some clunky CG that doesn't quite blend with the hand-drawn elements, but that's a relatively minor issue that doesn't come up as often as one would think.    As is often the case with Netflix releases, the series is available both in its original Japanese and dubbed into a number of languages. I can only speak to the Japanese and English versions, but both are strong and viewers should pick according to their preferences, though Cassandra Lee Morris is more or less wasted as the soft-spoken Konoha.    Despite its flaws, The Orbital Children is an excellent series, far and away one of the best anime series of the year so far. It's a must-watch for fans of Den-noh Coil, and a strong recommendation to pretty much everyone else. Now to start waiting for Iso's third series!

And now, he's supposed to play host to three teenagers who won a contest to come stay at the hotel/research facility where he lives.     Review:            Fifteen years ago, the skilled animator Mitsuo Iso helmed Den-noh Coil, a science fiction tale about children interacting with and exploring the world through augmented reality glasses. It was the first time he was able to show off his incredible storytelling chops, and the show garnered a cult following that excitedly waited for his follow-up. And waited. And waited. And when it seemed like that next project would never come, The Orbital Children was announced. When it finally made its premiere, all those patient fans, myself included, gathered to see if it would live up to its predecessor. Although I can only speak for myself, I found Iso's sophomore series to be an overall worthy, if somewhat weaker, successor to his first great success.    In Orbital Children, Iso revisits many of Den-noh Coil's most prominent themes, particularly the way children interact with technology, and how technology interacts with human existence. The technology, including super-intelligent AI systems and space travel, is considerably more advanced, but the core ideas remain similar. Touya, an intelligent and troubled teenager, has lived his whole life in space and only survived infancy thanks to an implant designed by the super-intelligent AI being known as Seven. He appears apathetic towards other humans, actively resentful of the Earthlings who he feels signed his death warrant when they eliminated Seven – leaving a seemingly defective implant in his head –  and has more interest in playing with and experimenting on the AIs that help run the space station/hotel where he lives with his uncle.    It's a heavy subject and Orbital Children dives right in, immediately introducing the audience to Touya and his issues, alongside his fellow space-born child Konoha and Nasa Houston, the ship's doctor who is trying to figure out how to extend their lives. Their world gets shaken up by a trio of teenage contest winners arriving on their station, the Anshin, followed shortly by a meteor impact that cuts off most of their power and isolates them from most of the adults who run the Anshin as the station leaks air.    Although Netflix has the series split into six episodes, it was also planned as two movies, which divides the series tidily into a two-act structure. The first half plays out as a well-made space disaster movie, with a group of adolescents cut off from their guardians trying to figure out how to cooperate and survive on their own with limited resources or guidance. Cast chemistry is essential to these scenarios, as the way the characters play off each other is the main source of both tension and relief. Orbital Children does well here, with its core cast of four adolescents and one young adult. The misanthropic Touya plays well off of Taiyou, an over-eager young white-hat hacker, and their immediate rivalry is fun and nails how two 14-year-olds with competing interests and no adult supervision would behave in their situation.    The second group – made up of the spacetuber Mina livestreaming the experience, her younger brother Hiroshi, Nasa, and Konoha – is somewhat less dynamic, and doesn't really come alive until they join back up with Taiyou and Touya. Mina is a lot of fun as a teenage influencer obsessed with gaining views, but Hiroshi doesn't really get a lot to do narratively and Konoha is mostly there to be ethereal and act as a plot device in the second half.    In the latter half, Orbital Children shifts away from a straightforward space survival story and toward the metaphysical, exploring the nature of AI and just what happened when Seven entered its lunatic phase, composed the Song of Seven, and was subsequently euthanized. One of the reasons it was taken offline was because it called for over a third of humanity to be eliminated to ensure the planet and its species' survival. Iso does not shy away from asking difficult and relevant questions: are “human” and “humanity” separate concepts? Must we sacrifice humans to save humanity?    These themes have been present in fiction for a long time, and have only felt more sharply relevant as time has gone on, so it's no wonder Iso wanted to explore them in his own way. It's honestly very interesting, especially tied in with the concept of “lunatic” artificial intelligence that is so advanced that it becomes almost godlike. However, there are certain elements that pulled me out a bit. I found myself frustrated that Konoha never really came into her own as a character, especially surrounded by big personalities like Touya, Taiyou, and Mina. Certain elements wrapped up too conveniently, essentially robbing the characters of their free will that weakened, rather than strengthened, the story. I can't help but think the story would have been stronger as a full-length TV series, giving the story and characters more time to play in the space that has been created for them, even if it weren't as tightly plotted.    Technically, it's still a strong effort. One of my favorite things about Den-noh Coil was how the characters were written and animated like actual children their age, and that has carried through to Orbital Children as well. Each character has a sense of physicality distinct from the others, but still within believability for their age group. The animation looks great, including even the space station setting, with a lot of thought put into just what a tourist-friendly space station would look like. There's some clunky CG that doesn't quite blend with the hand-drawn elements, but that's a relatively minor issue that doesn't come up as often as one would think.

Touya, an intelligent and troubled teenager, has lived his whole life in space and only survived infancy thanks to an implant designed by the super-intelligent AI being known as Seven. He appears apathetic towards other humans, actively resentful of the Earthlings who he feels signed his death warrant when they eliminated Seven – leaving a seemingly defective implant in his head –  and has more interest in playing with and experimenting on the AIs that help run the space station/hotel where he lives with his uncle.    It's a heavy subject and Orbital Children dives right in, immediately introducing the audience to Touya and his issues, alongside his fellow space-born child Konoha and Nasa Houston, the ship's doctor who is trying to figure out how to extend their lives. Their world gets shaken up by a trio of teenage contest winners arriving on their station, the Anshin, followed shortly by a meteor impact that cuts off most of their power and isolates them from most of the adults who run the Anshin as the station leaks air.    Although Netflix has the series split into six episodes, it was also planned as two movies, which divides the series tidily into a two-act structure. The first half plays out as a well-made space disaster movie, with a group of adolescents cut off from their guardians trying to figure out how to cooperate and survive on their own with limited resources or guidance. Cast chemistry is essential to these scenarios, as the way the characters play off each other is the main source of both tension and relief. Orbital Children does well here, with its core cast of four adolescents and one young adult. The misanthropic Touya plays well off of Taiyou, an over-eager young white-hat hacker, and their immediate rivalry is fun and nails how two 14-year-olds with competing interests and no adult supervision would behave in their situation.    The second group – made up of the spacetuber Mina livestreaming the experience, her younger brother Hiroshi, Nasa, and Konoha – is somewhat less dynamic, and doesn't really come alive until they join back up with Taiyou and Touya. Mina is a lot of fun as a teenage influencer obsessed with gaining views, but Hiroshi doesn't really get a lot to do narratively and Konoha is mostly there to be ethereal and act as a plot device in the second half.    In the latter half, Orbital Children shifts away from a straightforward space survival story and toward the metaphysical, exploring the nature of AI and just what happened when Seven entered its lunatic phase, composed the Song of Seven, and was subsequently euthanized. One of the reasons it was taken offline was because it called for over a third of humanity to be eliminated to ensure the planet and its species' survival. Iso does not shy away from asking difficult and relevant questions: are “human” and “humanity” separate concepts? Must we sacrifice humans to save humanity?    These themes have been present in fiction for a long time, and have only felt more sharply relevant as time has gone on, so it's no wonder Iso wanted to explore them in his own way. It's honestly very interesting, especially tied in with the concept of “lunatic” artificial intelligence that is so advanced that it becomes almost godlike. However, there are certain elements that pulled me out a bit. I found myself frustrated that Konoha never really came into her own as a character, especially surrounded by big personalities like Touya, Taiyou, and Mina. Certain elements wrapped up too conveniently, essentially robbing the characters of their free will that weakened, rather than strengthened, the story. I can't help but think the story would have been stronger as a full-length TV series, giving the story and characters more time to play in the space that has been created for them, even if it weren't as tightly plotted.    Technically, it's still a strong effort. One of my favorite things about Den-noh Coil was how the characters were written and animated like actual children their age, and that has carried through to Orbital Children as well. Each character has a sense of physicality distinct from the others, but still within believability for their age group. The animation looks great, including even the space station setting, with a lot of thought put into just what a tourist-friendly space station would look like. There's some clunky CG that doesn't quite blend with the hand-drawn elements, but that's a relatively minor issue that doesn't come up as often as one would think.    As is often the case with Netflix releases, the series is available both in its original Japanese and dubbed into a number of languages. I can only speak to the Japanese and English versions, but both are strong and viewers should pick according to their preferences, though Cassandra Lee Morris is more or less wasted as the soft-spoken Konoha.    Despite its flaws, The Orbital Children is an excellent series, far and away one of the best anime series of the year so far. It's a must-watch for fans of Den-noh Coil, and a strong recommendation to pretty much everyone else. Now to start waiting for Iso's third series!

Manga Artist Donates Film Rights Fee to Marriage For All Japan   posted on 2022-04-15 05:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Live-action film based on Yū Toyota's boys-love manga opened last Friday    Cherry Magic! Thirty Years of Virginity Can Make You a Wizard?! (30-sai Dōtei da to Mahō Tsukai ni Nareru Rashii) manga creator Yū Toyota announced on her Twitter account last Wednesday that she has donated part of the film/adaptation rights fee to Marriage For All Japan, an organization which advocates same-sex marriage in Japan.    ""I hope that our society can become a place where people can love each other in the form they desire regardless of gender,"" she wrote.    CheriMaho the Movie ~30-sai Dōtei da to Mahō Tsukai ni Nareru Rashii~ (Cherry Magic! the Movie: Thirty Years of Virginity Can Make You a Wizard?!), the film sequel to the live-action television series based on Toyota's manga opened in Japan last Friday.    Square Enix Manga & Books licensed the manga, and it describes the story:  Adachi, a thirty-year-old virgin, has developed the power to read people's minds by touching them. After a brush with his very handsome colleague, Adachi realizes he has a raging crush on none other than Adachi himself!  The manga began serialization on pixiv's Gangan pixiv service in 2018, and the manga's eighth compiled book volume shipped in Japan on October 21. Square Enix Manga released the second volume on September 8, and it is the first boys-love manga that the company has published in English.    The television series premiered on TV Tokyo on October 9, 2020, and it also streamed on the Tsutaya Premium service. Crunchyroll began streaming the series outside Japan in December 2020. The television series already inspired a two-episode net spinoff that debuted on the Tsutaya Premium streaming service on December 2020.

Manga Artist Donates Film Rights Fee to Marriage For All Japan   posted on 2022-04-15 05:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Live-action film based on Yū Toyota's boys-love manga opened last Friday    Cherry Magic! Thirty Years of Virginity Can Make You a Wizard?! (30-sai Dōtei da to Mahō Tsukai ni Nareru Rashii) manga creator Yū Toyota announced on her Twitter account last Wednesday that she has donated part of the film/adaptation rights fee to Marriage For All Japan, an organization which advocates same-sex marriage in Japan.    ""I hope that our society can become a place where people can love each other in the form they desire regardless of gender,"" she wrote.    CheriMaho the Movie ~30-sai Dōtei da to Mahō Tsukai ni Nareru Rashii~ (Cherry Magic! the Movie: Thirty Years of Virginity Can Make You a Wizard?!), the film sequel to the live-action television series based on Toyota's manga opened in Japan last Friday.    Square Enix Manga & Books licensed the manga, and it describes the story:  Adachi, a thirty-year-old virgin, has developed the power to read people's minds by touching them. After a brush with his very handsome colleague, Adachi realizes he has a raging crush on none other than Adachi himself!  The manga began serialization on pixiv's Gangan pixiv service in 2018, and the manga's eighth compiled book volume shipped in Japan on October 21. Square Enix Manga released the second volume on September 8, and it is the first boys-love manga that the company has published in English.    The television series premiered on TV Tokyo on October 9, 2020, and it also streamed on the Tsutaya Premium service. Crunchyroll began streaming the series outside Japan in December 2020. The television series already inspired a two-episode net spinoff that debuted on the Tsutaya Premium streaming service on December 2020.

I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!  phpBB 2 Issues Who wrote this bulletin board? Why isn't X feature available? Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.Back to top            Private Messaging    I cannot send private messages!You are probably not registered and/or not logged on.Back to top        I keep getting unwanted private messages!In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system. For now, though, if you keep receiving unwanted private messages from someone, inform the board administrator -- they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages at all.Back to top        I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!We are sorry to hear that. The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try to track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received and it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email). They can then take action.Back to top            phpBB 2 Issues    Who wrote this bulletin board?This software (in its unmodified form) is produced, released and is copyrighted phpBB Group.

I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!  phpBB 2 Issues Who wrote this bulletin board? Why isn't X feature available? Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.Back to top            Private Messaging    I cannot send private messages!You are probably not registered and/or not logged on.Back to top        I keep getting unwanted private messages!In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system. For now, though, if you keep receiving unwanted private messages from someone, inform the board administrator -- they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages at all.Back to top        I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!We are sorry to hear that. The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try to track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received and it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email). They can then take action.Back to top            phpBB 2 Issues    Who wrote this bulletin board?This software (in its unmodified form) is produced, released and is copyrighted phpBB Group.

GN 1   Apr 19, 00:00                 manga    This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula. ― Stop me if you've heard this one before: a mopey, socially anxious teenager just can't find the courage to make friends.

I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!  phpBB 2 Issues Who wrote this bulletin board? Why isn't X feature available? Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.Back to top            Private Messaging    I cannot send private messages!You are probably not registered and/or not logged on.Back to top        I keep getting unwanted private messages!In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system.

The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try to track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received and it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email).

I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!  phpBB 2 Issues Who wrote this bulletin board? Why isn't X feature available? Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.Back to top            Private Messaging    I cannot send private messages!You are probably not registered and/or not logged on.Back to top        I keep getting unwanted private messages!In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system. For now, though, if you keep receiving unwanted private messages from someone, inform the board administrator -- they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages at all.Back to top        I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!We are sorry to hear that. The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try to track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received and it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email).

This comment is a bit shortsighted because it implies another culture is inherently inferior because they lack some historical or religious basis for maintaining their overall position on this aspect.  Im not saying accept whatever basis makes homosexuality abhorrent to Japanese but it is strongly tied to their culture and it does have historical groundings in fact.  Im not going to speculate about it but I do want to advise not to respond to intolerance with more intolerance.

Japan historically never had the stigma to homosexuality vs the Christian-influenced West, and historic art in Japan is full of depictions of such relationships, as well as what we know of Japan's past contradicts your point, so your comment about it being 'abhorrent' historically and culturally doesn't make any sense. So if you want to prove your point, what facts exactly?

I think to limit it in terms such as history and religion only is in itself ingenious and insensitive.  There are other complex cultural aspects at play.

Sem sex marriage advocates are mostly rich people's pretending hobby in Japan and support of some audience doesn't really matter.           Of course it won't change if you give up from the get go. The discussion has to start from somewhere before it leads to change. Just because you say it will be impossible doesn't mean it will, how were the views on same sex marriage in the West 50 years ago? Look how far we've gone, and it's largely thanks to small campaigns like this, pushing back the mostly religious agenda at the time.   Also, claiming same sex advocacy is only a rich people hobby is a ridiculous statement, marriage infers various legal rights, and people's sexual orientation doesn't change with age, rich OR poor. It's simply a question of fairness.

This comment is a bit shortsighted because it implies another culture is inherently inferior because they lack some historical or religious basis for maintaining their overall position on this aspect.  Im not saying accept whatever basis makes homosexuality abhorrent to Japanese but it is strongly tied to their culture and it does have historical groundings in fact.  Im not going to speculate about it but I do want to advise not to respond to intolerance with more intolerance.

Japan historically never had the stigma to homosexuality vs the Christian-influenced West, and historic art in Japan is full of depictions of such relationships, as well as what we know of Japan's past contradicts your point, so your comment about it being 'abhorrent' historically and culturally doesn't make any sense. So if you want to prove your point, what facts exactly?

I think to limit it in terms such as history and religion only is in itself ingenious and insensitive.  There are other complex cultural aspects at play.

Sem sex marriage advocates are mostly rich people's pretending hobby in Japan and support of some audience doesn't really matter.           Of course it won't change if you give up from the get go. The discussion has to start from somewhere before it leads to change. Just because you say it will be impossible doesn't mean it will, how were the views on same sex marriage in the West 50 years ago? Look how far we've gone, and it's largely thanks to small campaigns like this, pushing back the mostly religious agenda at the time.   Also, claiming same sex advocacy is only a rich people hobby is a ridiculous statement, marriage infers various legal rights, and people's sexual orientation doesn't change with age, rich OR poor. It's simply a question of fairness.

This comment is a bit shortsighted because it implies another culture is inherently inferior because they lack some historical or religious basis for maintaining their overall position on this aspect.  Im not saying accept whatever basis makes homosexuality abhorrent to Japanese but it is strongly tied to their culture and it does have historical groundings in fact.  Im not going to speculate about it but I do want to advise not to respond to intolerance with more intolerance.

Japan historically never had the stigma to homosexuality vs the Christian-influenced West, and historic art in Japan is full of depictions of such relationships, as well as what we know of Japan's past contradicts your point, so your comment about it being 'abhorrent' historically and culturally doesn't make any sense. So if you want to prove your point, what facts exactly?

I think to limit it in terms such as history and religion only is in itself ingenious and insensitive.  There are other complex cultural aspects at play.

Sem sex marriage advocates are mostly rich people's pretending hobby in Japan and support of some audience doesn't really matter.           Of course it won't change if you give up from the get go. The discussion has to start from somewhere before it leads to change. Just because you say it will be impossible doesn't mean it will, how were the views on same sex marriage in the West 50 years ago? Look how far we've gone, and it's largely thanks to small campaigns like this, pushing back the mostly religious agenda at the time.   Also, claiming same sex advocacy is only a rich people hobby is a ridiculous statement, marriage infers various legal rights, and people's sexual orientation doesn't change with age, rich OR poor. It's simply a question of fairness.

This comment is a bit shortsighted because it implies another culture is inherently inferior because they lack some historical or religious basis for maintaining their overall position on this aspect.  Im not saying accept whatever basis makes homosexuality abhorrent to Japanese but it is strongly tied to their culture and it does have historical groundings in fact.  Im not going to speculate about it but I do want to advise not to respond to intolerance with more intolerance.

Japan historically never had the stigma to homosexuality vs the Christian-influenced West, and historic art in Japan is full of depictions of such relationships, as well as what we know of Japan's past contradicts your point, so your comment about it being 'abhorrent' historically and culturally doesn't make any sense. So if you want to prove your point, what facts exactly?

I think to limit it in terms such as history and religion only is in itself ingenious and insensitive.  There are other complex cultural aspects at play.

Same sex marriage will be impossible in Japan for next 50 years. More you become old more people gives priority to economy and security instead of such things. Sem sex marriage advocates are mostly rich people's pretending hobby in Japan and support of some audience doesn't really matter.

Sem sex marriage advocates are mostly rich people's pretending hobby in Japan and support of some audience doesn't really matter.           Of course it won't change if you give up from the get go. The discussion has to start from somewhere before it leads to change. Just because you say it will be impossible doesn't mean it will, how were the views on same sex marriage in the West 50 years ago? Look how far we've gone, and it's largely thanks to small campaigns like this, pushing back the mostly religious agenda at the time.   Also, claiming same sex advocacy is only a rich people hobby is a ridiculous statement, marriage infers various legal rights, and people's sexual orientation doesn't change with age, rich OR poor. It's simply a question of fairness.

News Key, Ryukishi07's Loopers Kinetic Novel Launches for Switch on June 2   posted on 2022-04-15 20:15 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra          Visual Arts, Key launched game for PC in Japan in May 2021    Prototype began streaming the opening movie for the Nintendo Switch release of Visual Arts and Key's LOOPERS kinetic novel on Friday. The video reveals that the Nintendo Switch version will launch on June 2.      sana (sajou no hana) performs the theme song ""Senya Ichiya VORTEX"" (A Thousand Nights One Night Vortex).    The game will be priced at US$24.99 in the United States, CA$33.24 in Canada, and €24.99 in Europe. The release will feature Japanese voices and text in Japanese, English, and Simplified Chinese.    Visual Arts and Key released the all-ages game on PC in May 2021, and stated later that month that the game will get an overseas release. Prototype announced the Nintendo Switch version on February 3. A smartphone version of the game is also in development.    Ryukishi07 (Higurashi: When They Cry, Umineko - When They Cry franchises) wrote the scenario for the game, and Kei Mochizuki was in charge of illustration. Kazuma Takata directed the game. The companies revealed the kinetic novel along with two other novels in October 2020. Visual Arts and Key describe the story of LOOPERS:   Let's set out to find a real treasure. Tyler is a high school student who is obsessed with geocaching, a GPS-based treasure hunting game. One day during summer vacation, Tyler and his friends get drawn into a mysterious incident while out treasure-hunting. The real and imagined become interconnected. Thoughts are thrown into chaos. Tomorrow becomes today.   Swallowed up by a time vortex, they are trapped in a never-ending time loop, repeating ""today"" again and again.    Then they meet other ""loopers."" Simon, the leader, and the mysterious girl Mia. If they join forces, will they be able to break out from this eternal prison...?   The game stars: Sayaka Kaneko as Mia, Tomohito Takatsuka as Tyler, Hiyori Kono as Hilda, Shiori Izawa as Leona, Ryohei Kimura as Simon, Yōsuke Etō as Joe, Hina Kino as Holly, and Anna Yamaki as Ritapon.

News Key, Ryukishi07's Loopers Kinetic Novel Launches for Switch on June 2   posted on 2022-04-15 20:15 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra          Visual Arts, Key launched game for PC in Japan in May 2021    Prototype began streaming the opening movie for the Nintendo Switch release of Visual Arts and Key's LOOPERS kinetic novel on Friday. The video reveals that the Nintendo Switch version will launch on June 2.      sana (sajou no hana) performs the theme song ""Senya Ichiya VORTEX"" (A Thousand Nights One Night Vortex).    The game will be priced at US$24.99 in the United States, CA$33.24 in Canada, and €24.99 in Europe. The release will feature Japanese voices and text in Japanese, English, and Simplified Chinese.    Visual Arts and Key released the all-ages game on PC in May 2021, and stated later that month that the game will get an overseas release. Prototype announced the Nintendo Switch version on February 3. A smartphone version of the game is also in development.    Ryukishi07 (Higurashi: When They Cry, Umineko - When They Cry franchises) wrote the scenario for the game, and Kei Mochizuki was in charge of illustration. Kazuma Takata directed the game. The companies revealed the kinetic novel along with two other novels in October 2020. Visual Arts and Key describe the story of LOOPERS:   Let's set out to find a real treasure. Tyler is a high school student who is obsessed with geocaching, a GPS-based treasure hunting game. One day during summer vacation, Tyler and his friends get drawn into a mysterious incident while out treasure-hunting. The real and imagined become interconnected. Thoughts are thrown into chaos. Tomorrow becomes today.   Swallowed up by a time vortex, they are trapped in a never-ending time loop, repeating ""today"" again and again.    Then they meet other ""loopers."" Simon, the leader, and the mysterious girl Mia. If they join forces, will they be able to break out from this eternal prison...?   The game stars: Sayaka Kaneko as Mia, Tomohito Takatsuka as Tyler, Hiyori Kono as Hilda, Shiori Izawa as Leona, Ryohei Kimura as Simon, Yōsuke Etō as Joe, Hina Kino as Holly, and Anna Yamaki as Ritapon.
