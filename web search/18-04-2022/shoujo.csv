The premise of a world occupied only by lesbians might sound silly on the surface, but 'Yuri Except for Me'  is a genuine attempt at creating a narrative arc for our main characters. ― I must say, the title and initial premise of this two-volume series did have me wondering just how much the story would fall back on gay panic or other stereotypes for the s...                    review                Soul Eater - The Perfect Edition GN 4-6   Mar 27, 00:00                 manga    The shonen action series enters Crona's arc, adding the most compelling drama in the series so far. ― Volume four of The Perfect Edition sees Soul Eater in pure, shonen action mode.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade.

Successfully combining the two into a compelling narrative, therefore, isn't necessarily an easy feat.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium.
