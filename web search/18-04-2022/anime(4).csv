REVIEW: Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        Kirki    Joined: 11 Jun 2019 		    Posts: 213       Posted: Sun Apr 17, 2022 2:43 am            Maybe it's just a personal preference but words can't explain how much I love this series, both the old one and this new one now that it grew on me. I'd argue that the story is much better in anime form than in the light novels, which seemed to be stepping on some serious breaks from the 4th novel onwards. I did not see that in the series at all, instead, it zoomed with relentless speed right up to its finale.    Politicking is number one in LotGH, but small character moments are of equal importance and don't let you get bored through the series 'history documentary' phase. There is so much meat in every episode, from Julian's friend realizing he survived his first battle, Reuenthal's backstory where his mother was essentially bought by his (in name) father and the consequences that resulted into, Mittermeyer's family bringing his future wife purposely into his house, and his goof with the yellow roses, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's friendship (seriously was the tacky torture scene plucked right out of a BL fanfic or something? So entertaining though!) Oberstein's affection for dogs, Yang refusing to acknowledge the danger he might be into.    I think that what I love the most about this series is that everything just clicks. Everything that's happening will have meaning and severe consequences later on. It just fascinates me that what the audience doesn't realize yet how truly important it was that Kempff was selected to guide the attack at Iserlohn. Eveything, from strategic planning to explaining some aspects of the character's motivations, has or will gain importance. Also keep an eye on Frederica.    Lastly, shout out to the new anime addition of the girl hyping for Reinhard's reforms because she would finally be able to publish her book. ""Honey it wasn't the cencorship's fault in the first place."" Says the husband while feeding their baby. Ouch. Did that guy graduate from University of Savageness or something.

REVIEW: Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        Kirki    Joined: 11 Jun 2019 		    Posts: 213       Posted: Sun Apr 17, 2022 2:43 am            Maybe it's just a personal preference but words can't explain how much I love this series, both the old one and this new one now that it grew on me. I'd argue that the story is much better in anime form than in the light novels, which seemed to be stepping on some serious breaks from the 4th novel onwards. I did not see that in the series at all, instead, it zoomed with relentless speed right up to its finale.    Politicking is number one in LotGH, but small character moments are of equal importance and don't let you get bored through the series 'history documentary' phase. There is so much meat in every episode, from Julian's friend realizing he survived his first battle, Reuenthal's backstory where his mother was essentially bought by his (in name) father and the consequences that resulted into, Mittermeyer's family bringing his future wife purposely into his house, and his goof with the yellow roses, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's friendship (seriously was the tacky torture scene plucked right out of a BL fanfic or something? So entertaining though!) Oberstein's affection for dogs, Yang refusing to acknowledge the danger he might be into.    I think that what I love the most about this series is that everything just clicks. Everything that's happening will have meaning and severe consequences later on. It just fascinates me that what the audience doesn't realize yet how truly important it was that Kempff was selected to guide the attack at Iserlohn. Eveything, from strategic planning to explaining some aspects of the character's motivations, has or will gain importance. Also keep an eye on Frederica.    Lastly, shout out to the new anime addition of the girl hyping for Reinhard's reforms because she would finally be able to publish her book. ""Honey it wasn't the cencorship's fault in the first place."" Says the husband while feeding their baby. Ouch. Did that guy graduate from University of Savageness or something.

REVIEW: Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        Kirki    Joined: 11 Jun 2019 		    Posts: 213       Posted: Sun Apr 17, 2022 2:43 am            Maybe it's just a personal preference but words can't explain how much I love this series, both the old one and this new one now that it grew on me. I'd argue that the story is much better in anime form than in the light novels, which seemed to be stepping on some serious breaks from the 4th novel onwards. I did not see that in the series at all, instead, it zoomed with relentless speed right up to its finale.    Politicking is number one in LotGH, but small character moments are of equal importance and don't let you get bored through the series 'history documentary' phase. There is so much meat in every episode, from Julian's friend realizing he survived his first battle, Reuenthal's backstory where his mother was essentially bought by his (in name) father and the consequences that resulted into, Mittermeyer's family bringing his future wife purposely into his house, and his goof with the yellow roses, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's friendship (seriously was the tacky torture scene plucked right out of a BL fanfic or something? So entertaining though!) Oberstein's affection for dogs, Yang refusing to acknowledge the danger he might be into.    I think that what I love the most about this series is that everything just clicks. Everything that's happening will have meaning and severe consequences later on. It just fascinates me that what the audience doesn't realize yet how truly important it was that Kempff was selected to guide the attack at Iserlohn. Eveything, from strategic planning to explaining some aspects of the character's motivations, has or will gain importance. Also keep an eye on Frederica.    Lastly, shout out to the new anime addition of the girl hyping for Reinhard's reforms because she would finally be able to publish her book. ""Honey it wasn't the cencorship's fault in the first place."" Says the husband while feeding their baby. Ouch. Did that guy graduate from University of Savageness or something.

I'd argue that the story is much better in anime form than in the light novels, which seemed to be stepping on some serious breaks from the 4th novel onwards. I did not see that in the series at all, instead, it zoomed with relentless speed right up to its finale.    Politicking is number one in LotGH, but small character moments are of equal importance and don't let you get bored through the series 'history documentary' phase. There is so much meat in every episode, from Julian's friend realizing he survived his first battle, Reuenthal's backstory where his mother was essentially bought by his (in name) father and the consequences that resulted into, Mittermeyer's family bringing his future wife purposely into his house, and his goof with the yellow roses, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's friendship (seriously was the tacky torture scene plucked right out of a BL fanfic or something? So entertaining though!) Oberstein's affection for dogs, Yang refusing to acknowledge the danger he might be into.    I think that what I love the most about this series is that everything just clicks. Everything that's happening will have meaning and severe consequences later on. It just fascinates me that what the audience doesn't realize yet how truly important it was that Kempff was selected to guide the attack at Iserlohn. Eveything, from strategic planning to explaining some aspects of the character's motivations, has or will gain importance. Also keep an eye on Frederica.    Lastly, shout out to the new anime addition of the girl hyping for Reinhard's reforms because she would finally be able to publish her book.

I'd argue that the story is much better in anime form than in the light novels, which seemed to be stepping on some serious breaks from the 4th novel onwards. I did not see that in the series at all, instead, it zoomed with relentless speed right up to its finale.    Politicking is number one in LotGH, but small character moments are of equal importance and don't let you get bored through the series 'history documentary' phase. There is so much meat in every episode, from Julian's friend realizing he survived his first battle, Reuenthal's backstory where his mother was essentially bought by his (in name) father and the consequences that resulted into, Mittermeyer's family bringing his future wife purposely into his house, and his goof with the yellow roses, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's friendship (seriously was the tacky torture scene plucked right out of a BL fanfic or something? So entertaining though!) Oberstein's affection for dogs, Yang refusing to acknowledge the danger he might be into.    I think that what I love the most about this series is that everything just clicks. Everything that's happening will have meaning and severe consequences later on. It just fascinates me that what the audience doesn't realize yet how truly important it was that Kempff was selected to guide the attack at Iserlohn. Eveything, from strategic planning to explaining some aspects of the character's motivations, has or will gain importance. Also keep an eye on Frederica.    Lastly, shout out to the new anime addition of the girl hyping for Reinhard's reforms because she would finally be able to publish her book.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Apr  1st 2022          Adblock+ breaks this page, consider whitelisting ANN   Welcome to Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Preview Guide! Here's how it goes: our team of critics write up their impressions instantly, to be posted here as they go along. Each critic will cover as many shows as they can handle, giving you alternate takes on most every show.    The guide is ongoing, organized by series and updated multiple times a day. Throughout the next week or two, we'll be updating as often as possible with new perspectives on new episodes from our team of critics. New reviews will be posted as soon as they're written, with each critic's name being added to the roster beneath the show's title. Check back a couple of times every day during the guide, and you're likely to see new shows pop up with multiple takes to enjoy!    Please remember that this is a preview guide. It is designed to give you a taste of the first episode of a show with a preliminary opinion and a few thoughts on whether or not the show has potential. These are not intended to be blanket judgments of these series as a whole. All reviews use the same ratings scale: 1-5, with 1 being the lowest.    Click on the survey at the top of each show's page to vote for your personal score and see how other people scored the show!   You can also check out this season's Trailer Watch Party with Lynzee Loveridge, Jacki Jing, and YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement) first impression of the season's shows.

Here's how it goes: our team of critics write up their impressions instantly, to be posted here as they go along. Each critic will cover as many shows as they can handle, giving you alternate takes on most every show.    The guide is ongoing, organized by series and updated multiple times a day. Throughout the next week or two, we'll be updating as often as possible with new perspectives on new episodes from our team of critics. New reviews will be posted as soon as they're written, with each critic's name being added to the roster beneath the show's title. Check back a couple of times every day during the guide, and you're likely to see new shows pop up with multiple takes to enjoy!    Please remember that this is a preview guide. It is designed to give you a taste of the first episode of a show with a preliminary opinion and a few thoughts on whether or not the show has potential. These are not intended to be blanket judgments of these series as a whole. All reviews use the same ratings scale: 1-5, with 1 being the lowest.

But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 04:30 18 comments                 anime    In Slow Loop's naturally gentle way, an empty photo album becomes a perfect way to hint at a new adventure: picking out pictures from the past few seasons together to fill the album with not just as sisters, but as friends.                    ep. review          77 comments       Princess Connect!

Like Vanitas' hourglass, all the sand is in one section.

Then, all of a sudden, here comes Teasing Master Takagi-san, hell-bent on getting my grinchy ol' heart to grow three sizes in the middle of freaking March.                    ep. review          31 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 03:30 31 comments                 anime    I'm thoroughly convinced it's Megistus who is the secret sauce. The dude is basically the walking embodiment of a single great joke, that of a villainous commander actually being an excellent, caring boss.

But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 04:30 18 comments                 anime    In Slow Loop's naturally gentle way, an empty photo album becomes a perfect way to hint at a new adventure: picking out pictures from the past few seasons together to fill the album with not just as sisters, but as friends.                    ep. review          77 comments       Princess Connect!

Like Vanitas' hourglass, all the sand is in one section.

Then, all of a sudden, here comes Teasing Master Takagi-san, hell-bent on getting my grinchy ol' heart to grow three sizes in the middle of freaking March.                    ep. review          31 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 03:30 31 comments                 anime    I'm thoroughly convinced it's Megistus who is the secret sauce. The dude is basically the walking embodiment of a single great joke, that of a villainous commander actually being an excellent, caring boss.

But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ SEASON FINALE   Mar 30, 04:30 18 comments                 anime    In Slow Loop's naturally gentle way, an empty photo album becomes a perfect way to hint at a new adventure: picking out pictures from the past few seasons together to fill the album with not just as sisters, but as friends.                    ep. review          77 comments       Princess Connect!

Like Vanitas' hourglass, all the sand is in one section.

I've been half-joking that the bad guys were evil feminists all along, but the show is tantalizingly close to making that its explicit reality.                    ep. review          27 comments       Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 ‒ Episode 10   Mar 15, 01:30 27 comments                 anime    This week's episode was great but it just didn't melt my heart into a puddle of pure syrup to be poured into a batter baked into a seven-layer “Dawwwwwwwwww” cake. There are much worse problems to have.                    ep. review          36 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 9   Mar 15, 00:30 36 comments                 anime    The curtain to the show's prevailing mysteries are finally starting to be pulled back, and some of the revelations we get this episode are very intriguing.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ Episode 10   Mar 14, 23:30 45 comments                 anime    Cayna's characterization in recent episodes have brought out the quirky, doting motherly side that I think Leadale has always been trying to show but got lost in her unjustified anger-filled outbursts.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 21   Mar 12, 03:30 95 comments                 anime    Louis' death affected more people than just him, and one other very, very specifically: Dominique, his sister.                    ep. review          177 comments       Ranking of Kings ‒ Episodes 20-21   Mar 12, 02:30 177 comments                 anime    I don't think it's an exaggeration to say this series, and this episode in particular, will serve as inspiration for years to come.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 9   Mar 12, 01:30 47 comments                 anime    It's time for another action-centric episode of Arifureta. Say what you want, but this is where the story really gets to show off.                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 22   Mar 12, 00:30 107 comments                 anime    Yoneda and his interminably stupid Genius Atheist shtick has sucked up every molecule of oxygen in this show since he first opened his mouth.                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 9   Mar 11, 03:30 19 comments                 anime    The show finally digs into something really, really cool: Ojiro and Kazuki's backstory, which was thuddingly hinted at in the final moments of episode 8.                    ep. review          16 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 9   Mar 11, 02:30 16 comments                 anime    Where the present-day story of Tokyo 24th Ward has been about extreme expressions of socio-politics informed by technology, this flashback sees the characters more directly grappling with tech's impact on that society.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ Episode 9   Mar 10, 02:30 89 comments                 anime    Wein is, by design, an overpowering presence in the story. He is smarter and more skilled than everyone else. However, that's not to say he doesn't have weaknesses.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ Episode 9   Mar 10, 01:31 51 comments                 anime    Sometimes, when putting a story together, you just want to riff on the final act of Terminator 2, and that's valid. Sabikui Bisco certainly wears its influences on its sleeve as it catapults into yet another climax.                    ep. review          48 comments       Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout ‒ Episodes 8-9   Mar 10, 00:30 48 comments                 anime    While there are a few funny moments or chuckle-worthy faces hidden in there, the first half of the episode is just one big joke about how Shen is totally trying to assault Jinguuji, and it's a rough sit.                    ep. review          58 comments       Sasaki and Miyano ‒ Episode 9   Mar  9, 05:30 58 comments                 anime    What started off as largely obligation has become a chance for Miyano to explore his own anxieties about his appearance in a relatively safe – yet still public – situation.                    ep. review          77 comments       Princess Connect!

Given that we're also talking about an isekai with harem elements, I was basically in full Brace For Impact mode when this episode started.                    ep. review          168 comments       Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ‒ Episode 84   Mar  8, 09:30 168 comments                 anime    Jean's betrayal of Floch and the Jeagerists doesn't just make for a convenient way to get the different characters in one place; it is a culmination of his entire character arc.                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 08:30 18 comments                 anime    The series continues to be incredibly charming, and reminds me that sometimes, slowing down and enjoying the ebb and flow of life – and maybe having some good fish – is the way to go.                    ep. review          45 comments       Requiem of the Rose King ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 07:30 45 comments                 anime    Richard tries to make a sacrifice to prevent familial slaughter but it may not be enough to circumvent this slow-motion tragedy.                    ep. review          101 comments       World's End Harem ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 06:30 101 comments                 anime    No, the site didn't glitch out on you. That thumbnail is an actual screencap from World’s End Harem, and it's far from the worst example I could have chosen.                    ep. review          40 comments       Delicious Party Precure ‒ Episode 5   Mar  8, 05:30 40 comments                 anime    This week's episode focuses on the team member's feelings, whether its shyness or overall feeling out of place.                    ep. review          27 comments       Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 04:30 27 comments                 anime    I can't remember the last time that Christmas actually felt like Christmas.

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            interview                I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   Apr 18, 21:00                 live-action    This isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work, but his role as the eponymous Aono-kun is something a little different– he's a ghost.

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            interview                I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   Apr 18, 21:00                 live-action    This isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work, but his role as the eponymous Aono-kun is something a little different– he's a ghost.

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            interview                I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   Apr 18, 21:00                 live-action    This isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work, but his role as the eponymous Aono-kun is something a little different– he's a ghost.

Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            interview                I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   Apr 18, 21:00                 live-action    This isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work, but his role as the eponymous Aono-kun is something a little different– he's a ghost.

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company.

It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-ingram-73542921/': 1}"

Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line.

And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-ingram-73542921/': 1}"

Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll.
