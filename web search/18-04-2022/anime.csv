Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Hello, Melancholic!

Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Hello, Melancholic!

Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series.

Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Hello, Melancholic!

Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series.

Episodes 1-3  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.    Any other concerns for how this show might trend forward are firmly questions for the future. I'm not even entirely opposed to the idea of some adversarial elements. Mia, the rival musician introduced in the second episode, has her propensity for Dick Datastardly-style antics which I pretty well enjoy. Plus, come on, this is a show where the opening features everyone dancing around to ""Chikichiki Banban"" (in what's got to be a contender for opener of the year) – things are probably going to work out generally nicely overall. For now, these are opening episodes that immediately make the conceptual hooks clear for Ya Boy Kongming, a series that can seem like an oddly askew gimmick at first pass, but which I've kind of utterly fallen for by this point in its efforts of establishing itself.

Episodes 1-3  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.    Any other concerns for how this show might trend forward are firmly questions for the future. I'm not even entirely opposed to the idea of some adversarial elements. Mia, the rival musician introduced in the second episode, has her propensity for Dick Datastardly-style antics which I pretty well enjoy. Plus, come on, this is a show where the opening features everyone dancing around to ""Chikichiki Banban"" (in what's got to be a contender for opener of the year) – things are probably going to work out generally nicely overall. For now, these are opening episodes that immediately make the conceptual hooks clear for Ya Boy Kongming, a series that can seem like an oddly askew gimmick at first pass, but which I've kind of utterly fallen for by this point in its efforts of establishing itself.

Episodes 1-3  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.    Any other concerns for how this show might trend forward are firmly questions for the future. I'm not even entirely opposed to the idea of some adversarial elements. Mia, the rival musician introduced in the second episode, has her propensity for Dick Datastardly-style antics which I pretty well enjoy. Plus, come on, this is a show where the opening features everyone dancing around to ""Chikichiki Banban"" (in what's got to be a contender for opener of the year) – things are probably going to work out generally nicely overall. For now, these are opening episodes that immediately make the conceptual hooks clear for Ya Boy Kongming, a series that can seem like an oddly askew gimmick at first pass, but which I've kind of utterly fallen for by this point in its efforts of establishing itself.

Episodes 1-3  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.    Any other concerns for how this show might trend forward are firmly questions for the future. I'm not even entirely opposed to the idea of some adversarial elements. Mia, the rival musician introduced in the second episode, has her propensity for Dick Datastardly-style antics which I pretty well enjoy. Plus, come on, this is a show where the opening features everyone dancing around to ""Chikichiki Banban"" (in what's got to be a contender for opener of the year) – things are probably going to work out generally nicely overall. For now, these are opening episodes that immediately make the conceptual hooks clear for Ya Boy Kongming, a series that can seem like an oddly askew gimmick at first pass, but which I've kind of utterly fallen for by this point in its efforts of establishing itself.

Episodes 1-3  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.

Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.    Any other concerns for how this show might trend forward are firmly questions for the future. I'm not even entirely opposed to the idea of some adversarial elements. Mia, the rival musician introduced in the second episode, has her propensity for Dick Datastardly-style antics which I pretty well enjoy. Plus, come on, this is a show where the opening features everyone dancing around to ""Chikichiki Banban"" (in what's got to be a contender for opener of the year) – things are probably going to work out generally nicely overall. For now, these are opening episodes that immediately make the conceptual hooks clear for Ya Boy Kongming, a series that can seem like an oddly askew gimmick at first pass, but which I've kind of utterly fallen for by this point in its efforts of establishing itself.

Was it a failure in terms of sales towards the end?   Normally, successful projects like this are run for many years, sometimes even for more than a decade. And they do not become bad or dragged just because they are long.   E.g. One Piece and Naruto had the main story planned for many years ahead of writing/drawing the chapters, they were not invented on the spot just to prolong the mangas. (Unlike Bleach where ""plot"" of a team member being kidnapped is just endlessly repeated and beaten to death, which had a drastic consequence for sales of the manga as it was obviously aimlessly dragged without any actual thought behind this.)   Or was it the author's actual intent to make this story relatively short?

Ridiculous. It’s hilarious to me how so many people still jump on a Naruto hate bandwagon in 2022 after years of time to understand the story. While I wouldn’t call the final arc a masterpiece or thoroughly planned because there are numerous flaws and missed opportunities, it certainly was not horrible.

Was it a failure in terms of sales towards the end?       Nope. While Demon Slayer wasn't a huge hit before the anime it was selling just fine. It just wasn't built to run indefinitely and had already started its final arc around the time the anime released and sales started exploding. They could have theoretically extended it - introduce new enemies or a threat bigger than Muzan or something - but I think the creator and everyone involved recognized that would just drag it out too long, so they finished it up at just over 200 chapters. I think the era of super-long running shonen jump hits is mostly over, One Piece notwithstanding. Nowadays editorial - and the actual manga creators - seem to value the prospect of ending a series when it's ready instead of dragging it out endlessly.

You have to be the only person on earth who thinks Demon Slayer, one of the most successful mangas in the last years, that most of the time even surpassed One Piece as the No. 1 manga seller in the world, with the most successful anime movie of all time and with the anime show being milked through the years by released like 10+ episodes at at time, and which ended naturally upon the mangaka's wishes, ended because it was a fAiLuRe iN tErMs oF sAlEs tOwArDs tHe eNd.   I hope youre just a troll, because you can't be this disconnected from reality.

Look on the bright side, if something blows up and becomes really big, there are always other opportunities to capitalize on that with spin-offs and original short stories, original OVAs and films that can be just as good in the same universe leveraging its other cast members and none of that dilutes the strength of the original source material.   If the author decides there was other untapped potential there, they can always come back to do a few more original stories.

And they do not become bad or dragged just because they are long.   E.g. One Piece and Naruto had the main story planned for many years ahead of writing/drawing the chapters, they were not invented on the spot just to prolong the mangas.

Or was it the author's actual intent to make this story relatively short?            crazy how you put naruto and "" a story that was planned for many years ahead and not invented on the spot"" on the same sentence, and gives it as an example for a story that did not become bad.  naruto's last arc was horrible writing. the ending was garbage. in fact half way into part 2 of the manga the story started to go down hill, the last arc was just the peak of its bad writing.            Ridiculous. It’s hilarious to me how so many people still jump on a Naruto hate bandwagon in 2022 after years of time to understand the story. While I wouldn’t call the final arc a masterpiece or thoroughly planned because there are numerous flaws and missed opportunities, it certainly was not horrible. The ending is an all time favorite of mine.            Yeah, Kaguya totally has been set up as the final boss. Totally not because Kishimoto accidentally made Madara too strong so he had to make another villain to upstate Madara. Oh and let not forget all the story themes and messages that got toss aside along the way and how most side characters got sidelined (who is Tenten anyway?)

I'd love to known what the main story of One Piece is, since every arc give 50 new characters to remember then mostly discarded when they move to the next island.

We are rolling quickly towards the finale.    As for people saying Demon Slayer manga was a failure, be aware if you are a decently long running battle shonen in Weekly Shonen Jump, you are more or less at the top of the food chain for series. Jump is a huge brand in japan and like in every Family Mart. You are nearly guaranteed a decently competent studio to handle your production. Only slip up i think was tokyo ghoul re but I don't think it is that bad.   Ufotable really wasn't considering taking that big of a risk. If they wanted to take risks, they would try to adapt a relatively obscure series from Kadokawa.

Who was even more stronger than Madara and couldn’t be defeated under practical circumstances.      KarlFranz wrote:      Oh and let not forget all the story themes and messages that got toss aside along the way and how most side characters got sidelined (who is Tenten anyway?)            I mean let’s not pretend that TenTen ever had as much relevance and importance as Neji & Lee. Like the only memorable thing she did was get squashed off screen by Temari who later joined her village years later. While it is true that Naruto did undercut’s it’s supporting characters by barely using them in the story. It’s been demonstrated that trying to give your supporting characters too much focus in parts of the story where they’re not needed can also be an issue as Bleach infamously demonstrated numerous times.

That's not really ""maximizing profits"" so much as it's prioritizing short-term profits over long term. JJK and Demon Slayer have certain maid bank, DS especially, but their lifetime sales are still less than half of One Piece's.

Was it a failure in terms of sales towards the end?       Nope. While Demon Slayer wasn't a huge hit before the anime it was selling just fine. It just wasn't built to run indefinitely and had already started its final arc around the time the anime released and sales started exploding. They could have theoretically extended it - introduce new enemies or a threat bigger than Muzan or something - but I think the creator and everyone involved recognized that would just drag it out too long, so they finished it up at just over 200 chapters. I think the era of super-long running shonen jump hits is mostly over, One Piece notwithstanding. Nowadays editorial - and the actual manga creators - seem to value the prospect of ending a series when it's ready instead of dragging it out endlessly.

You have to be the only person on earth who thinks Demon Slayer, one of the most successful mangas in the last years, that most of the time even surpassed One Piece as the No. 1 manga seller in the world, with the most successful anime movie of all time and with the anime show being milked through the years by released like 10+ episodes at at time, and which ended naturally upon the mangaka's wishes, ended because it was a fAiLuRe iN tErMs oF sAlEs tOwArDs tHe eNd.   I hope youre just a troll, because you can't be this disconnected from reality.

Look on the bright side, if something blows up and becomes really big, there are always other opportunities to capitalize on that with spin-offs and original short stories, original OVAs and films that can be just as good in the same universe leveraging its other cast members and none of that dilutes the strength of the original source material.   If the author decides there was other untapped potential there, they can always come back to do a few more original stories.

Totally not because Kishimoto accidentally made Madara too strong so he had to make another villain to upstate Madara.

We are rolling quickly towards the finale.    As for people saying Demon Slayer manga was a failure, be aware if you are a decently long running battle shonen in Weekly Shonen Jump, you are more or less at the top of the food chain for series. Jump is a huge brand in japan and like in every Family Mart. You are nearly guaranteed a decently competent studio to handle your production. Only slip up i think was tokyo ghoul re but I don't think it is that bad.   Ufotable really wasn't considering taking that big of a risk. If they wanted to take risks, they would try to adapt a relatively obscure series from Kadokawa.

Which was solved by dusting off Kaguya who despite what people think wasn’t created in part 2 as she was mentioned/referred to all the way back in part 1. Who was even more stronger than Madara and couldn’t be defeated under practical circumstances.      KarlFranz wrote:      Oh and let not forget all the story themes and messages that got toss aside along the way and how most side characters got sidelined (who is Tenten anyway?)            I mean let’s not pretend that TenTen ever had as much relevance and importance as Neji & Lee. Like the only memorable thing she did was get squashed off screen by Temari who later joined her village years later. While it is true that Naruto did undercut’s it’s supporting characters by barely using them in the story. It’s been demonstrated that trying to give your supporting characters too much focus in parts of the story where they’re not needed can also be an issue as Bleach infamously demonstrated numerous times.

That's not really ""maximizing profits"" so much as it's prioritizing short-term profits over long term. JJK and Demon Slayer have certain maid bank, DS especially, but their lifetime sales are still less than half of One Piece's.
