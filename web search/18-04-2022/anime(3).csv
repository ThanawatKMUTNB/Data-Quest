The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4              What is this?   Yūko Yoshida is a 15-year-old girl who awakens one morning with demonic power, and is tasked with defeating a local magical girl. She has horns and a tail, but truthfully less power than an ordinary girl. She struggles to lift the ""curse of a 40,000 yen (about US$365) per month living."" (from manga)   The Demon Girl Next Door is based on Izumo Ito's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                So, here's a funny story: I somehow got The Demon Girl Next Door confused with last year's The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!. Once I realized my initial mix-up, I spent some time scouring wikis to give myself a crash course on the basic premise, but honestly, I was nowhere near as lost as I feared I would be. If you ever needed proof that The Preview Guide sometimes works in mysterious ways, it turns out that I loved every second of this sequel, and it is easily the best premiere I've seen all week.    I'm sure there are plenty of in-jokes and callbacks I missed, but it's easy enough to get the gist: It's a world of magical girls and demons living in modern Japan, and wacky shenanigans are going to ensue when they try to get along. Yuko (aka Shamiko) is a fiesty but but well-meaning demon; Momo is a reserved and somewhat awkward magical girl; Lilith is Shamiko's ancestor that looks like a cartoon mascot sex toy for some reason; Shamiko's father is a literal cardboard box called Daddy Box, and her family uses him as a kitchen appliance and dining table.    You know. Your everyday sort of stuff!    Here's the thing: If an anime manages to make me laugh, it's already earned a hell of a lot of goodwill in my book, and The Demon Girl Next Door had me absolutely cackling. Even better, all of the jokes were rooted in surprisingly strong and deliberate writing, so I was able to catch up on a lot of the character dynamics and backstory. I learned that Lilith is a charming little gremlin, that Mikan loves putting lemons in food, and that Momo is almost certainly the best girl of the series and also definitely in love with her rival Shamiko.    I know that this one will likely fly under the radar since it's only streaming on HIDIVE, but if you take only a single thing away from my Preview Guide dispatches this spring, let it be this: this one episode of The Demon Girl Next Door made me into a convert, and catching up on Season 1 is going to become a top priority. It's that good. Do yourself a favor and give the series a shot.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            interview                I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   Apr 18, 21:00                 live-action    This isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work, but his role as the eponymous Aono-kun is something a little different– he's a ghost.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4              What is this?   Yūko Yoshida is a 15-year-old girl who awakens one morning with demonic power, and is tasked with defeating a local magical girl. She has horns and a tail, but truthfully less power than an ordinary girl. She struggles to lift the ""curse of a 40,000 yen (about US$365) per month living."" (from manga)   The Demon Girl Next Door is based on Izumo Ito's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                So, here's a funny story: I somehow got The Demon Girl Next Door confused with last year's The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!. Once I realized my initial mix-up, I spent some time scouring wikis to give myself a crash course on the basic premise, but honestly, I was nowhere near as lost as I feared I would be. If you ever needed proof that The Preview Guide sometimes works in mysterious ways, it turns out that I loved every second of this sequel, and it is easily the best premiere I've seen all week.    I'm sure there are plenty of in-jokes and callbacks I missed, but it's easy enough to get the gist: It's a world of magical girls and demons living in modern Japan, and wacky shenanigans are going to ensue when they try to get along. Yuko (aka Shamiko) is a fiesty but but well-meaning demon; Momo is a reserved and somewhat awkward magical girl; Lilith is Shamiko's ancestor that looks like a cartoon mascot sex toy for some reason; Shamiko's father is a literal cardboard box called Daddy Box, and her family uses him as a kitchen appliance and dining table.    You know. Your everyday sort of stuff!    Here's the thing: If an anime manages to make me laugh, it's already earned a hell of a lot of goodwill in my book, and The Demon Girl Next Door had me absolutely cackling. Even better, all of the jokes were rooted in surprisingly strong and deliberate writing, so I was able to catch up on a lot of the character dynamics and backstory. I learned that Lilith is a charming little gremlin, that Mikan loves putting lemons in food, and that Momo is almost certainly the best girl of the series and also definitely in love with her rival Shamiko.    I know that this one will likely fly under the radar since it's only streaming on HIDIVE, but if you take only a single thing away from my Preview Guide dispatches this spring, let it be this: this one episode of The Demon Girl Next Door made me into a convert, and catching up on Season 1 is going to become a top priority. It's that good. Do yourself a favor and give the series a shot.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            interview                I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   Apr 18, 21:00                 live-action    This isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work, but his role as the eponymous Aono-kun is something a little different– he's a ghost.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4              What is this?   Yūko Yoshida is a 15-year-old girl who awakens one morning with demonic power, and is tasked with defeating a local magical girl. She has horns and a tail, but truthfully less power than an ordinary girl. She struggles to lift the ""curse of a 40,000 yen (about US$365) per month living."" (from manga)   The Demon Girl Next Door is based on Izumo Ito's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                So, here's a funny story: I somehow got The Demon Girl Next Door confused with last year's The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!. Once I realized my initial mix-up, I spent some time scouring wikis to give myself a crash course on the basic premise, but honestly, I was nowhere near as lost as I feared I would be. If you ever needed proof that The Preview Guide sometimes works in mysterious ways, it turns out that I loved every second of this sequel, and it is easily the best premiere I've seen all week.    I'm sure there are plenty of in-jokes and callbacks I missed, but it's easy enough to get the gist: It's a world of magical girls and demons living in modern Japan, and wacky shenanigans are going to ensue when they try to get along. Yuko (aka Shamiko) is a fiesty but but well-meaning demon; Momo is a reserved and somewhat awkward magical girl; Lilith is Shamiko's ancestor that looks like a cartoon mascot sex toy for some reason; Shamiko's father is a literal cardboard box called Daddy Box, and her family uses him as a kitchen appliance and dining table.    You know. Your everyday sort of stuff!    Here's the thing: If an anime manages to make me laugh, it's already earned a hell of a lot of goodwill in my book, and The Demon Girl Next Door had me absolutely cackling. Even better, all of the jokes were rooted in surprisingly strong and deliberate writing, so I was able to catch up on a lot of the character dynamics and backstory. I learned that Lilith is a charming little gremlin, that Mikan loves putting lemons in food, and that Momo is almost certainly the best girl of the series and also definitely in love with her rival Shamiko.    I know that this one will likely fly under the radar since it's only streaming on HIDIVE, but if you take only a single thing away from my Preview Guide dispatches this spring, let it be this: this one episode of The Demon Girl Next Door made me into a convert, and catching up on Season 1 is going to become a top priority. It's that good.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4              What is this?   Yūko Yoshida is a 15-year-old girl who awakens one morning with demonic power, and is tasked with defeating a local magical girl. She has horns and a tail, but truthfully less power than an ordinary girl. She struggles to lift the ""curse of a 40,000 yen (about US$365) per month living."" (from manga)   The Demon Girl Next Door is based on Izumo Ito's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                So, here's a funny story: I somehow got The Demon Girl Next Door confused with last year's The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!. Once I realized my initial mix-up, I spent some time scouring wikis to give myself a crash course on the basic premise, but honestly, I was nowhere near as lost as I feared I would be. If you ever needed proof that The Preview Guide sometimes works in mysterious ways, it turns out that I loved every second of this sequel, and it is easily the best premiere I've seen all week.    I'm sure there are plenty of in-jokes and callbacks I missed, but it's easy enough to get the gist: It's a world of magical girls and demons living in modern Japan, and wacky shenanigans are going to ensue when they try to get along. Yuko (aka Shamiko) is a fiesty but but well-meaning demon; Momo is a reserved and somewhat awkward magical girl; Lilith is Shamiko's ancestor that looks like a cartoon mascot sex toy for some reason; Shamiko's father is a literal cardboard box called Daddy Box, and her family uses him as a kitchen appliance and dining table.    You know. Your everyday sort of stuff!    Here's the thing: If an anime manages to make me laugh, it's already earned a hell of a lot of goodwill in my book, and The Demon Girl Next Door had me absolutely cackling. Even better, all of the jokes were rooted in surprisingly strong and deliberate writing, so I was able to catch up on a lot of the character dynamics and backstory. I learned that Lilith is a charming little gremlin, that Mikan loves putting lemons in food, and that Momo is almost certainly the best girl of the series and also definitely in love with her rival Shamiko.    I know that this one will likely fly under the radar since it's only streaming on HIDIVE, but if you take only a single thing away from my Preview Guide dispatches this spring, let it be this: this one episode of The Demon Girl Next Door made me into a convert, and catching up on Season 1 is going to become a top priority. It's that good.

Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Episodes 1-3  by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9                    How would you rate episode 2 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.2                    How would you rate episode 3 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.3            A comedic formula that's gotten one hell of a workout the last decade is that of sticking your main character next to the class oddball. Whether their desk neighbor is building Rube Goldberg machines out of school supplies or just constantly falling asleep, it's pretty easy to make gags so long as you can innovate on whatever brand of weirdness your central character exudes. On its surface, Aharen-san definitely seems like another entry in that little comedy subgenre, and in some ways it definitely is. But somewhere in episode two it started to hit me that this wasn't quite the same thing. This wasn't a show about a rational straightman being constantly surprised by how strange the girl next to him is – it's a show about two absolute morons “Yes, and”-ing each other's specific brand of goofiness until the tower of rock-stupid cards they've stacked tumbles down on top of them.    Raido really is the difference-maker here. He could very easily have been your standard straightman character, reacting in bewilderment at every seemingly inexplicable quirk Aharen presents. But instead he may actually be weirder and dumber than his pint-sized partner in comedy. The moment that tipped me off was when, realizing somebody was following him, Raido's first and only thought was that it must be a hitman, leading to him thinking back on all the terrible things he's done in his past (read: accidentally crushing some flowers with a soccer ball and eating his sister's pudding cup) and concluding that he really is a monster. It's a pretty simple joke, but what makes it work is that he's 100% serious and stonefaced through the entire thing, and the contrast between his bizarre imagination and dead serious exterior works to make it hilarious.    That's the secret sauce that really makes these episodes work so far. The best skits tap into the same kind of energy as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun's famous Tomoda skit where two characters just get on the same wavelength and nobody's around to stop them as they test out weird ideas and half-baked plans with nothing but the most deadpan of expressions. Even when that feedback loop is broken up by our third (and so far only) major character, Raido never becomes a shouting tsukkomi, but just rolls with Oshiro's towering shyness. The show understands that these gags work best on their own without any loud commentary, and that allows it to breeze through a ton of great punchlines while keeping its pace snappy. That's a godsend for a show built around a repetitive setup, and is going to be crucial in keeping this series fresh as it moves forward.    The timing and animation will also be pretty important, though that doesn't mean the show needs to be a nonstop sakuga parade to be funny. Knowing when to time and how to stage each joke is most important, and so far the show has demonstrated a pretty great grasp of both. The only skit that sticks out as lacking in that department is the softball game in episode three, but for the most part the direction has been solid and consistent in letting the inherent humor of its visual gags speak for themselves. Aharen pulls out four-foot long chopsticks to feed Oshiro and nobody bats an eye. I'm only slightly ashamed to admit the myriad ways Aharen covered up Raido's open fly had me dying laughing. And the weird little dance sequences (and the delightful new ED animation) in episode three display that this show can move plenty when it needs to.    This is also still a romantic comedy, and while our central couple aren't going to set anyone's hearts on fire, their comedic chemistry actually does a great job highlighting why they'd actually make a pretty cute couple. These are two weirdos with negative amounts of social grace just trying to fumble their way into friendship, and they always have each other's back no matter what. Even when he doesn't understand what Aharen is doing or thinking, Raido never gets angry or short-tempered with her. Aharen isn't always great (or coherent) at showing it, but she goes out of her way to support Raido as well. That camaraderie makes them just plain fun to follow as they try to whack their collective pair of braincells together each episode. There's certainly humor to be mined from clashing personalities, but these two work best when they're on the same wavelength, and that makes for a pretty pleasant watch.    This is a stacked season for comedies, with or without romance, and while Aharen-san wa Hakarenai probably won't ever compete with Kaguya-sama for popularity, it certainly can carve out its own niche. The cast will all but certainly expand sooner or later, and some tweaks may be needed to keep the humor from getting stale, but right now the series has definitely put its best foot forward.

Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Episodes 1-3  by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9                    How would you rate episode 2 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.2                    How would you rate episode 3 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.3            A comedic formula that's gotten one hell of a workout the last decade is that of sticking your main character next to the class oddball. Whether their desk neighbor is building Rube Goldberg machines out of school supplies or just constantly falling asleep, it's pretty easy to make gags so long as you can innovate on whatever brand of weirdness your central character exudes. On its surface, Aharen-san definitely seems like another entry in that little comedy subgenre, and in some ways it definitely is. But somewhere in episode two it started to hit me that this wasn't quite the same thing. This wasn't a show about a rational straightman being constantly surprised by how strange the girl next to him is – it's a show about two absolute morons “Yes, and”-ing each other's specific brand of goofiness until the tower of rock-stupid cards they've stacked tumbles down on top of them.    Raido really is the difference-maker here. He could very easily have been your standard straightman character, reacting in bewilderment at every seemingly inexplicable quirk Aharen presents. But instead he may actually be weirder and dumber than his pint-sized partner in comedy. The moment that tipped me off was when, realizing somebody was following him, Raido's first and only thought was that it must be a hitman, leading to him thinking back on all the terrible things he's done in his past (read: accidentally crushing some flowers with a soccer ball and eating his sister's pudding cup) and concluding that he really is a monster. It's a pretty simple joke, but what makes it work is that he's 100% serious and stonefaced through the entire thing, and the contrast between his bizarre imagination and dead serious exterior works to make it hilarious.    That's the secret sauce that really makes these episodes work so far. The best skits tap into the same kind of energy as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun's famous Tomoda skit where two characters just get on the same wavelength and nobody's around to stop them as they test out weird ideas and half-baked plans with nothing but the most deadpan of expressions. Even when that feedback loop is broken up by our third (and so far only) major character, Raido never becomes a shouting tsukkomi, but just rolls with Oshiro's towering shyness. The show understands that these gags work best on their own without any loud commentary, and that allows it to breeze through a ton of great punchlines while keeping its pace snappy. That's a godsend for a show built around a repetitive setup, and is going to be crucial in keeping this series fresh as it moves forward.    The timing and animation will also be pretty important, though that doesn't mean the show needs to be a nonstop sakuga parade to be funny. Knowing when to time and how to stage each joke is most important, and so far the show has demonstrated a pretty great grasp of both. The only skit that sticks out as lacking in that department is the softball game in episode three, but for the most part the direction has been solid and consistent in letting the inherent humor of its visual gags speak for themselves. Aharen pulls out four-foot long chopsticks to feed Oshiro and nobody bats an eye. I'm only slightly ashamed to admit the myriad ways Aharen covered up Raido's open fly had me dying laughing. And the weird little dance sequences (and the delightful new ED animation) in episode three display that this show can move plenty when it needs to.    This is also still a romantic comedy, and while our central couple aren't going to set anyone's hearts on fire, their comedic chemistry actually does a great job highlighting why they'd actually make a pretty cute couple. These are two weirdos with negative amounts of social grace just trying to fumble their way into friendship, and they always have each other's back no matter what. Even when he doesn't understand what Aharen is doing or thinking, Raido never gets angry or short-tempered with her. Aharen isn't always great (or coherent) at showing it, but she goes out of her way to support Raido as well. That camaraderie makes them just plain fun to follow as they try to whack their collective pair of braincells together each episode. There's certainly humor to be mined from clashing personalities, but these two work best when they're on the same wavelength, and that makes for a pretty pleasant watch.    This is a stacked season for comedies, with or without romance, and while Aharen-san wa Hakarenai probably won't ever compete with Kaguya-sama for popularity, it certainly can carve out its own niche. The cast will all but certainly expand sooner or later, and some tweaks may be needed to keep the humor from getting stale, but right now the series has definitely put its best foot forward.

The only skit that sticks out as lacking in that department is the softball game in episode three, but for the most part the direction has been solid and consistent in letting the inherent humor of its visual gags speak for themselves. Aharen pulls out four-foot long chopsticks to feed Oshiro and nobody bats an eye. I'm only slightly ashamed to admit the myriad ways Aharen covered up Raido's open fly had me dying laughing. And the weird little dance sequences (and the delightful new ED animation) in episode three display that this show can move plenty when it needs to.    This is also still a romantic comedy, and while our central couple aren't going to set anyone's hearts on fire, their comedic chemistry actually does a great job highlighting why they'd actually make a pretty cute couple. These are two weirdos with negative amounts of social grace just trying to fumble their way into friendship, and they always have each other's back no matter what. Even when he doesn't understand what Aharen is doing or thinking, Raido never gets angry or short-tempered with her. Aharen isn't always great (or coherent) at showing it, but she goes out of her way to support Raido as well. That camaraderie makes them just plain fun to follow as they try to whack their collective pair of braincells together each episode. There's certainly humor to be mined from clashing personalities, but these two work best when they're on the same wavelength, and that makes for a pretty pleasant watch.    This is a stacked season for comedies, with or without romance, and while Aharen-san wa Hakarenai probably won't ever compete with Kaguya-sama for popularity, it certainly can carve out its own niche. The cast will all but certainly expand sooner or later, and some tweaks may be needed to keep the humor from getting stale, but right now the series has definitely put its best foot forward.

Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Episodes 1-3  by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9                    How would you rate episode 2 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.2                    How would you rate episode 3 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.3            A comedic formula that's gotten one hell of a workout the last decade is that of sticking your main character next to the class oddball. Whether their desk neighbor is building Rube Goldberg machines out of school supplies or just constantly falling asleep, it's pretty easy to make gags so long as you can innovate on whatever brand of weirdness your central character exudes. On its surface, Aharen-san definitely seems like another entry in that little comedy subgenre, and in some ways it definitely is. But somewhere in episode two it started to hit me that this wasn't quite the same thing. This wasn't a show about a rational straightman being constantly surprised by how strange the girl next to him is – it's a show about two absolute morons “Yes, and”-ing each other's specific brand of goofiness until the tower of rock-stupid cards they've stacked tumbles down on top of them.    Raido really is the difference-maker here. He could very easily have been your standard straightman character, reacting in bewilderment at every seemingly inexplicable quirk Aharen presents. But instead he may actually be weirder and dumber than his pint-sized partner in comedy. The moment that tipped me off was when, realizing somebody was following him, Raido's first and only thought was that it must be a hitman, leading to him thinking back on all the terrible things he's done in his past (read: accidentally crushing some flowers with a soccer ball and eating his sister's pudding cup) and concluding that he really is a monster. It's a pretty simple joke, but what makes it work is that he's 100% serious and stonefaced through the entire thing, and the contrast between his bizarre imagination and dead serious exterior works to make it hilarious.    That's the secret sauce that really makes these episodes work so far. The best skits tap into the same kind of energy as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun's famous Tomoda skit where two characters just get on the same wavelength and nobody's around to stop them as they test out weird ideas and half-baked plans with nothing but the most deadpan of expressions. Even when that feedback loop is broken up by our third (and so far only) major character, Raido never becomes a shouting tsukkomi, but just rolls with Oshiro's towering shyness. The show understands that these gags work best on their own without any loud commentary, and that allows it to breeze through a ton of great punchlines while keeping its pace snappy. That's a godsend for a show built around a repetitive setup, and is going to be crucial in keeping this series fresh as it moves forward.    The timing and animation will also be pretty important, though that doesn't mean the show needs to be a nonstop sakuga parade to be funny. Knowing when to time and how to stage each joke is most important, and so far the show has demonstrated a pretty great grasp of both. The only skit that sticks out as lacking in that department is the softball game in episode three, but for the most part the direction has been solid and consistent in letting the inherent humor of its visual gags speak for themselves. Aharen pulls out four-foot long chopsticks to feed Oshiro and nobody bats an eye. I'm only slightly ashamed to admit the myriad ways Aharen covered up Raido's open fly had me dying laughing. And the weird little dance sequences (and the delightful new ED animation) in episode three display that this show can move plenty when it needs to.    This is also still a romantic comedy, and while our central couple aren't going to set anyone's hearts on fire, their comedic chemistry actually does a great job highlighting why they'd actually make a pretty cute couple. These are two weirdos with negative amounts of social grace just trying to fumble their way into friendship, and they always have each other's back no matter what. Even when he doesn't understand what Aharen is doing or thinking, Raido never gets angry or short-tempered with her. Aharen isn't always great (or coherent) at showing it, but she goes out of her way to support Raido as well. That camaraderie makes them just plain fun to follow as they try to whack their collective pair of braincells together each episode. There's certainly humor to be mined from clashing personalities, but these two work best when they're on the same wavelength, and that makes for a pretty pleasant watch.    This is a stacked season for comedies, with or without romance, and while Aharen-san wa Hakarenai probably won't ever compete with Kaguya-sama for popularity, it certainly can carve out its own niche. The cast will all but certainly expand sooner or later, and some tweaks may be needed to keep the humor from getting stale, but right now the series has definitely put its best foot forward.

Not amazing, but not bad either.  If Arc's look in the game was due to spoiler[a skin instead of a race choice], then maybe that's why he can do things like eat and be hungry? (not sure if that's a spoiler...)     Quote:    I'm a simple man: Ponta running laps across Arc's enormous pauldrons got a solid laugh out of me.            Yeah, Ponta using those absurdly large video game pauldrons to ride on is a great use of them lol      Back to top                  MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3897       Posted: Fri Apr 15, 2022 4:38 pm            This seems like it's setting up to be a fairly fun and enjoyable RPG Isekai romp, though I feel like it'll really settle into its own once we properly meet the female lead.   Things got pretty explicit in the first episode but I'm glad nothing happened to Maca and her family and it was a fairly wholesome second episode.   Tomoaki Maeno is really selling Arc's character. He has a laugh that would do Skeletor proud.    Ponta is adorable.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

They were faithful to the light novel.  The prologue to the light novel is from the POV of the young ladies.  While the first chapter was Arc's arrival on the world and his POV from there.   Can't wait to get to the meat of the first arc, and see what everyone thinks.

It comes down to how its presented and its purpose, if its just for shock value or even worse titillation then that's annoying and even gross. It really did feel unnecessary. I think there are other ways to convey that this world can be dark and has its dangers.    The second episode was ok-ish? I'm willing to give the show another episode, because first episode complaints aside it seems like it may have the potential to be fun. However, its going to have to kick it into gear and find that funny bone some more if its going to hold my attention.

But he did do everything in his power to prevent it.  He stopped them before they could rape her, and he sliced them in half so they aren't going to be able to try that again.  How much more preventing can you ask for exactly?

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

But thanks for your take on it, reading about how detailed and into the scene the show is is rather off putting.    As for your question @SilverTalon Well basicly the review descriptions and other like Thesarum have state how talked about how the scene was depicted (twice) with much detail and the reviews also talk about how the MC was struggling with risking himself to help them. I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.   I dont suppose you could provide time stamps to avoid the content? That would be cool.

That would be cool.            Honestly, you shouldn't bother picking this up for your own good. While not every arc in this series (*groan*) has scenes like the first episode, there will be at least two more instances of characters being threatened with rape. There will also be a worse scene where spoiler[Arc and company free pregnant slaves who were implied to have been raped repeatedly over a period of months, if not longer.]   Despite how jovial and even wholesome Arc can be, the actual world is much darker than his perspective usually suggests.   It is actually worse than Goblin Slayer in that it doesn't end at a singular event to set the tone, or imply it without description as in that series's LNs. It happens less as Skeletal Knight goes on, but I can't imagine how taxing it would be to watch while constantly wondering when the other shoe will drop.   It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.

I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.  As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.            If that's true, it's a shame. I don't understand why some writers feel the need to beat audiences over the head with the most viscerally repugnant content they can imagine, especially when they know they're not going to address it in any meaningful way, let alone give it the treatment it deserves. And before someone tries to go there, yes, this applies to gore as well. Spending time to detail the process of someone getting bisected or dismembered or beheaded adds nothing to the story, demonstrates nothing, and shines no light on anything in any sense other than trying to out-shock the last shocking event you think people saw. Generally it seems like over the last 10-15 years you have a number of series saying, ""well, we can't think of any more shockingly graphic death scenes, I guess we'll shock people with sexual assaults instead.""    I'll stop ranting now. I might keep going with the series a while to see how things play out. I assumed the Ep1 situation was a one and done deal, but my hopes for the series have been diminished.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.  For the last two items, that is through rape. ]  The anime has been faithful to the light novel considering these scenes.  Which bodes well for those of us that want a faithful adaptation.  But if the current content bothers you, I don't recommend watching anymore.  Future scenes could be just as bad, and you will know exactly what is going on.

On the whole, you will get way more of Arc being Arc than scenes of rape or gore. Just know there will be more of that unless they decided to tone things down in adaptation. (Doesn't seem like it. :p)   Skeletal Knight does avoid some of the usual isekai pitfalls and has more of an old school fantasy vibe if you can ignore the shlock. That said, it doesn't hold a candle to the likes of The Executioner and Her Way of Life or Ascendance of a Bookworm.

Sexual violence exists in the world, and it's absolutely legitimate to talk about it in fiction. But it should never be casually thrown around like it's some sort of narrative spice that can be sprinkled on to lend your story some ""darkness"" with a side order of titillation. I've not read the LN, so I've no idea how well it'll be handled here, but I'm not hugely optimistic. Either way, it's not really what I was looking for from this show.

Not amazing, but not bad either.  If Arc's look in the game was due to spoiler[a skin instead of a race choice], then maybe that's why he can do things like eat and be hungry? (not sure if that's a spoiler...)     Quote:    I'm a simple man: Ponta running laps across Arc's enormous pauldrons got a solid laugh out of me.

Things got pretty explicit in the first episode but I'm glad nothing happened to Maca and her family and it was a fairly wholesome second episode.   Tomoaki Maeno is really selling Arc's character. He has a laugh that would do Skeletor proud.    Ponta is adorable.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

They were faithful to the light novel.  The prologue to the light novel is from the POV of the young ladies.  While the first chapter was Arc's arrival on the world and his POV from there.   Can't wait to get to the meat of the first arc, and see what everyone thinks.

It comes down to how its presented and its purpose, if its just for shock value or even worse titillation then that's annoying and even gross. It really did feel unnecessary. I think there are other ways to convey that this world can be dark and has its dangers.    The second episode was ok-ish? I'm willing to give the show another episode, because first episode complaints aside it seems like it may have the potential to be fun. However, its going to have to kick it into gear and find that funny bone some more if its going to hold my attention.

But he did do everything in his power to prevent it.  He stopped them before they could rape her, and he sliced them in half so they aren't going to be able to try that again.  How much more preventing can you ask for exactly?

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

But thanks for your take on it, reading about how detailed and into the scene the show is is rather off putting.    As for your question @SilverTalon Well basicly the review descriptions and other like Thesarum have state how talked about how the scene was depicted (twice) with much detail and the reviews also talk about how the MC was struggling with risking himself to help them. I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.   I dont suppose you could provide time stamps to avoid the content? That would be cool.

That would be cool.            Honestly, you shouldn't bother picking this up for your own good. While not every arc in this series (*groan*) has scenes like the first episode, there will be at least two more instances of characters being threatened with rape. There will also be a worse scene where spoiler[Arc and company free pregnant slaves who were implied to have been raped repeatedly over a period of months, if not longer.]   Despite how jovial and even wholesome Arc can be, the actual world is much darker than his perspective usually suggests.   It is actually worse than Goblin Slayer in that it doesn't end at a singular event to set the tone, or imply it without description as in that series's LNs. It happens less as Skeletal Knight goes on, but I can't imagine how taxing it would be to watch while constantly wondering when the other shoe will drop.   It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.

I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.            I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.  As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.            If that's true, it's a shame. I don't understand why some writers feel the need to beat audiences over the head with the most viscerally repugnant content they can imagine, especially when they know they're not going to address it in any meaningful way, let alone give it the treatment it deserves. And before someone tries to go there, yes, this applies to gore as well. Spending time to detail the process of someone getting bisected or dismembered or beheaded adds nothing to the story, demonstrates nothing, and shines no light on anything in any sense other than trying to out-shock the last shocking event you think people saw. Generally it seems like over the last 10-15 years you have a number of series saying, ""well, we can't think of any more shockingly graphic death scenes, I guess we'll shock people with sexual assaults instead.""    I'll stop ranting now. I might keep going with the series a while to see how things play out. I assumed the Ep1 situation was a one and done deal, but my hopes for the series have been diminished.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.  For the last two items, that is through rape. ]  The anime has been faithful to the light novel considering these scenes.  Which bodes well for those of us that want a faithful adaptation.  But if the current content bothers you, I don't recommend watching anymore.  Future scenes could be just as bad, and you will know exactly what is going on.

On the whole, you will get way more of Arc being Arc than scenes of rape or gore. Just know there will be more of that unless they decided to tone things down in adaptation. (Doesn't seem like it. :p)   Skeletal Knight does avoid some of the usual isekai pitfalls and has more of an old school fantasy vibe if you can ignore the shlock. That said, it doesn't hold a candle to the likes of The Executioner and Her Way of Life or Ascendance of a Bookworm.

Sexual violence exists in the world, and it's absolutely legitimate to talk about it in fiction. But it should never be casually thrown around like it's some sort of narrative spice that can be sprinkled on to lend your story some ""darkness"" with a side order of titillation. I've not read the LN, so I've no idea how well it'll be handled here, but I'm not hugely optimistic. Either way, it's not really what I was looking for from this show.

Things got pretty explicit in the first episode but I'm glad nothing happened to Maca and her family and it was a fairly wholesome second episode.   Tomoaki Maeno is really selling Arc's character. He has a laugh that would do Skeletor proud.    Ponta is adorable.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

They were faithful to the light novel.  The prologue to the light novel is from the POV of the young ladies.  While the first chapter was Arc's arrival on the world and his POV from there.   Can't wait to get to the meat of the first arc, and see what everyone thinks.

It comes down to how its presented and its purpose, if its just for shock value or even worse titillation then that's annoying and even gross. It really did feel unnecessary. I think there are other ways to convey that this world can be dark and has its dangers.    The second episode was ok-ish? I'm willing to give the show another episode, because first episode complaints aside it seems like it may have the potential to be fun. However, its going to have to kick it into gear and find that funny bone some more if its going to hold my attention.

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

But thanks for your take on it, reading about how detailed and into the scene the show is is rather off putting.    As for your question @SilverTalon Well basicly the review descriptions and other like Thesarum have state how talked about how the scene was depicted (twice) with much detail and the reviews also talk about how the MC was struggling with risking himself to help them. I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.   I dont suppose you could provide time stamps to avoid the content? That would be cool.

That would be cool.            Honestly, you shouldn't bother picking this up for your own good. While not every arc in this series (*groan*) has scenes like the first episode, there will be at least two more instances of characters being threatened with rape. There will also be a worse scene where spoiler[Arc and company free pregnant slaves who were implied to have been raped repeatedly over a period of months, if not longer.]   Despite how jovial and even wholesome Arc can be, the actual world is much darker than his perspective usually suggests.   It is actually worse than Goblin Slayer in that it doesn't end at a singular event to set the tone, or imply it without description as in that series's LNs. It happens less as Skeletal Knight goes on, but I can't imagine how taxing it would be to watch while constantly wondering when the other shoe will drop.   It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.

I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.  As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.            If that's true, it's a shame. I don't understand why some writers feel the need to beat audiences over the head with the most viscerally repugnant content they can imagine, especially when they know they're not going to address it in any meaningful way, let alone give it the treatment it deserves. And before someone tries to go there, yes, this applies to gore as well. Spending time to detail the process of someone getting bisected or dismembered or beheaded adds nothing to the story, demonstrates nothing, and shines no light on anything in any sense other than trying to out-shock the last shocking event you think people saw. Generally it seems like over the last 10-15 years you have a number of series saying, ""well, we can't think of any more shockingly graphic death scenes, I guess we'll shock people with sexual assaults instead.""    I'll stop ranting now. I might keep going with the series a while to see how things play out. I assumed the Ep1 situation was a one and done deal, but my hopes for the series have been diminished.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.  For the last two items, that is through rape. ]  The anime has been faithful to the light novel considering these scenes.  Which bodes well for those of us that want a faithful adaptation.  But if the current content bothers you, I don't recommend watching anymore.  Future scenes could be just as bad, and you will know exactly what is going on.

On the whole, you will get way more of Arc being Arc than scenes of rape or gore. Just know there will be more of that unless they decided to tone things down in adaptation. (Doesn't seem like it. :p)   Skeletal Knight does avoid some of the usual isekai pitfalls and has more of an old school fantasy vibe if you can ignore the shlock. That said, it doesn't hold a candle to the likes of The Executioner and Her Way of Life or Ascendance of a Bookworm.

Sexual violence exists in the world, and it's absolutely legitimate to talk about it in fiction. But it should never be casually thrown around like it's some sort of narrative spice that can be sprinkled on to lend your story some ""darkness"" with a side order of titillation. I've not read the LN, so I've no idea how well it'll be handled here, but I'm not hugely optimistic. Either way, it's not really what I was looking for from this show.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

They were faithful to the light novel.  The prologue to the light novel is from the POV of the young ladies.  While the first chapter was Arc's arrival on the world and his POV from there.   Can't wait to get to the meat of the first arc, and see what everyone thinks.

It comes down to how its presented and its purpose, if its just for shock value or even worse titillation then that's annoying and even gross. It really did feel unnecessary. I think there are other ways to convey that this world can be dark and has its dangers.    The second episode was ok-ish? I'm willing to give the show another episode, because first episode complaints aside it seems like it may have the potential to be fun. However, its going to have to kick it into gear and find that funny bone some more if its going to hold my attention.

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

But thanks for your take on it, reading about how detailed and into the scene the show is is rather off putting.    As for your question @SilverTalon Well basicly the review descriptions and other like Thesarum have state how talked about how the scene was depicted (twice) with much detail and the reviews also talk about how the MC was struggling with risking himself to help them. I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.   I dont suppose you could provide time stamps to avoid the content? That would be cool.

While not every arc in this series (*groan*) has scenes like the first episode, there will be at least two more instances of characters being threatened with rape. There will also be a worse scene where spoiler[Arc and company free pregnant slaves who were implied to have been raped repeatedly over a period of months, if not longer.]   Despite how jovial and even wholesome Arc can be, the actual world is much darker than his perspective usually suggests.   It is actually worse than Goblin Slayer in that it doesn't end at a singular event to set the tone, or imply it without description as in that series's LNs. It happens less as Skeletal Knight goes on, but I can't imagine how taxing it would be to watch while constantly wondering when the other shoe will drop.   It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.

I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.  As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.            If that's true, it's a shame. I don't understand why some writers feel the need to beat audiences over the head with the most viscerally repugnant content they can imagine, especially when they know they're not going to address it in any meaningful way, let alone give it the treatment it deserves. And before someone tries to go there, yes, this applies to gore as well. Spending time to detail the process of someone getting bisected or dismembered or beheaded adds nothing to the story, demonstrates nothing, and shines no light on anything in any sense other than trying to out-shock the last shocking event you think people saw. Generally it seems like over the last 10-15 years you have a number of series saying, ""well, we can't think of any more shockingly graphic death scenes, I guess we'll shock people with sexual assaults instead.""    I'll stop ranting now. I might keep going with the series a while to see how things play out. I assumed the Ep1 situation was a one and done deal, but my hopes for the series have been diminished.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.  For the last two items, that is through rape. ]  The anime has been faithful to the light novel considering these scenes.  Which bodes well for those of us that want a faithful adaptation.  But if the current content bothers you, I don't recommend watching anymore.  Future scenes could be just as bad, and you will know exactly what is going on.

On the whole, you will get way more of Arc being Arc than scenes of rape or gore. Just know there will be more of that unless they decided to tone things down in adaptation. (Doesn't seem like it. :p)   Skeletal Knight does avoid some of the usual isekai pitfalls and has more of an old school fantasy vibe if you can ignore the shlock. That said, it doesn't hold a candle to the likes of The Executioner and Her Way of Life or Ascendance of a Bookworm.

Sexual violence exists in the world, and it's absolutely legitimate to talk about it in fiction. But it should never be casually thrown around like it's some sort of narrative spice that can be sprinkled on to lend your story some ""darkness"" with a side order of titillation. I've not read the LN, so I've no idea how well it'll be handled here, but I'm not hugely optimistic. Either way, it's not really what I was looking for from this show.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

But thanks for your take on it, reading about how detailed and into the scene the show is is rather off putting.    As for your question @SilverTalon Well basicly the review descriptions and other like Thesarum have state how talked about how the scene was depicted (twice) with much detail and the reviews also talk about how the MC was struggling with risking himself to help them. I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.

It is actually worse than Goblin Slayer in that it doesn't end at a singular event to set the tone, or imply it without description as in that series's LNs. It happens less as Skeletal Knight goes on, but I can't imagine how taxing it would be to watch while constantly wondering when the other shoe will drop.   It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.

I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.  As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.            If that's true, it's a shame. I don't understand why some writers feel the need to beat audiences over the head with the most viscerally repugnant content they can imagine, especially when they know they're not going to address it in any meaningful way, let alone give it the treatment it deserves. And before someone tries to go there, yes, this applies to gore as well. Spending time to detail the process of someone getting bisected or dismembered or beheaded adds nothing to the story, demonstrates nothing, and shines no light on anything in any sense other than trying to out-shock the last shocking event you think people saw. Generally it seems like over the last 10-15 years you have a number of series saying, ""well, we can't think of any more shockingly graphic death scenes, I guess we'll shock people with sexual assaults instead.""    I'll stop ranting now. I might keep going with the series a while to see how things play out. I assumed the Ep1 situation was a one and done deal, but my hopes for the series have been diminished.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.  For the last two items, that is through rape. ]  The anime has been faithful to the light novel considering these scenes.  Which bodes well for those of us that want a faithful adaptation.  But if the current content bothers you, I don't recommend watching anymore.  Future scenes could be just as bad, and you will know exactly what is going on.

On the whole, you will get way more of Arc being Arc than scenes of rape or gore. Just know there will be more of that unless they decided to tone things down in adaptation. (Doesn't seem like it. :p)   Skeletal Knight does avoid some of the usual isekai pitfalls and has more of an old school fantasy vibe if you can ignore the shlock. That said, it doesn't hold a candle to the likes of The Executioner and Her Way of Life or Ascendance of a Bookworm.

Sexual violence exists in the world, and it's absolutely legitimate to talk about it in fiction. But it should never be casually thrown around like it's some sort of narrative spice that can be sprinkled on to lend your story some ""darkness"" with a side order of titillation. I've not read the LN, so I've no idea how well it'll be handled here, but I'm not hugely optimistic. Either way, it's not really what I was looking for from this show.

Not amazing, but not bad either.  If Arc's look in the game was due to spoiler[a skin instead of a race choice], then maybe that's why he can do things like eat and be hungry?

Things got pretty explicit in the first episode but I'm glad nothing happened to Maca and her family and it was a fairly wholesome second episode.   Tomoaki Maeno is really selling Arc's character. He has a laugh that would do Skeletor proud.    Ponta is adorable.

Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.  For the last two items, that is through rape. ]  The anime has been faithful to the light novel considering these scenes.  Which bodes well for those of us that want a faithful adaptation.  But if the current content bothers you, I don't recommend watching anymore.  Future scenes could be just as bad, and you will know exactly what is going on.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

They were faithful to the light novel.  The prologue to the light novel is from the POV of the young ladies.  While the first chapter was Arc's arrival on the world and his POV from there.   Can't wait to get to the meat of the first arc, and see what everyone thinks.

It comes down to how its presented and its purpose, if its just for shock value or even worse titillation then that's annoying and even gross. It really did feel unnecessary. I think there are other ways to convey that this world can be dark and has its dangers.    The second episode was ok-ish? I'm willing to give the show another episode, because first episode complaints aside it seems like it may have the potential to be fun. However, its going to have to kick it into gear and find that funny bone some more if its going to hold my attention.

But he did do everything in his power to prevent it.  He stopped them before they could rape her, and he sliced them in half so they aren't going to be able to try that again.  How much more preventing can you ask for exactly?

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

But thanks for your take on it, reading about how detailed and into the scene the show is is rather off putting.    As for your question @SilverTalon Well basicly the review descriptions and other like Thesarum have state how talked about how the scene was depicted (twice) with much detail and the reviews also talk about how the MC was struggling with risking himself to help them. I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.   I dont suppose you could provide time stamps to avoid the content? That would be cool.

That would be cool.            Honestly, you shouldn't bother picking this up for your own good. While not every arc in this series (*groan*) has scenes like the first episode, there will be at least two more instances of characters being threatened with rape. There will also be a worse scene where spoiler[Arc and company free pregnant slaves who were implied to have been raped repeatedly over a period of months, if not longer.]   Despite how jovial and even wholesome Arc can be, the actual world is much darker than his perspective usually suggests.   It is actually worse than Goblin Slayer in that it doesn't end at a singular event to set the tone, or imply it without description as in that series's LNs. It happens less as Skeletal Knight goes on, but I can't imagine how taxing it would be to watch while constantly wondering when the other shoe will drop.   It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.

I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.

They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.

I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.  As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

I don't understand why some writers feel the need to beat audiences over the head with the most viscerally repugnant content they can imagine, especially when they know they're not going to address it in any meaningful way, let alone give it the treatment it deserves. And before someone tries to go there, yes, this applies to gore as well. Spending time to detail the process of someone getting bisected or dismembered or beheaded adds nothing to the story, demonstrates nothing, and shines no light on anything in any sense other than trying to out-shock the last shocking event you think people saw. Generally it seems like over the last 10-15 years you have a number of series saying, ""well, we can't think of any more shockingly graphic death scenes, I guess we'll shock people with sexual assaults instead.""    I'll stop ranting now. I might keep going with the series a while to see how things play out. I assumed the Ep1 situation was a one and done deal, but my hopes for the series have been diminished.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.  For the last two items, that is through rape. ]  The anime has been faithful to the light novel considering these scenes.  Which bodes well for those of us that want a faithful adaptation.  But if the current content bothers you, I don't recommend watching anymore.  Future scenes could be just as bad, and you will know exactly what is going on.

On the whole, you will get way more of Arc being Arc than scenes of rape or gore. Just know there will be more of that unless they decided to tone things down in adaptation. (Doesn't seem like it. :p)   Skeletal Knight does avoid some of the usual isekai pitfalls and has more of an old school fantasy vibe if you can ignore the shlock. That said, it doesn't hold a candle to the likes of The Executioner and Her Way of Life or Ascendance of a Bookworm.

Sexual violence exists in the world, and it's absolutely legitimate to talk about it in fiction. But it should never be casually thrown around like it's some sort of narrative spice that can be sprinkled on to lend your story some ""darkness"" with a side order of titillation. I've not read the LN, so I've no idea how well it'll be handled here, but I'm not hugely optimistic. Either way, it's not really what I was looking for from this show.

Not amazing, but not bad either.  If Arc's look in the game was due to spoiler[a skin instead of a race choice], then maybe that's why he can do things like eat and be hungry? (not sure if that's a spoiler...)     Quote:    I'm a simple man: Ponta running laps across Arc's enormous pauldrons got a solid laugh out of me.

Things got pretty explicit in the first episode but I'm glad nothing happened to Maca and her family and it was a fairly wholesome second episode.   Tomoaki Maeno is really selling Arc's character. He has a laugh that would do Skeletor proud.    Ponta is adorable.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.  For the last two items, that is through rape. ]  The anime has been faithful to the light novel considering these scenes.  Which bodes well for those of us that want a faithful adaptation.  But if the current content bothers you, I don't recommend watching anymore.  Future scenes could be just as bad, and you will know exactly what is going on.

Not amazing, but not bad either.  If Arc's look in the game was due to spoiler[a skin instead of a race choice], then maybe that's why he can do things like eat and be hungry? (not sure if that's a spoiler...)     Quote:    I'm a simple man: Ponta running laps across Arc's enormous pauldrons got a solid laugh out of me.

Things got pretty explicit in the first episode but I'm glad nothing happened to Maca and her family and it was a fairly wholesome second episode.   Tomoaki Maeno is really selling Arc's character. He has a laugh that would do Skeletor proud.    Ponta is adorable.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

They were faithful to the light novel.  The prologue to the light novel is from the POV of the young ladies.  While the first chapter was Arc's arrival on the world and his POV from there.   Can't wait to get to the meat of the first arc, and see what everyone thinks.

It comes down to how its presented and its purpose, if its just for shock value or even worse titillation then that's annoying and even gross. It really did feel unnecessary. I think there are other ways to convey that this world can be dark and has its dangers.    The second episode was ok-ish? I'm willing to give the show another episode, because first episode complaints aside it seems like it may have the potential to be fun. However, its going to have to kick it into gear and find that funny bone some more if its going to hold my attention.

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

But thanks for your take on it, reading about how detailed and into the scene the show is is rather off putting.    As for your question @SilverTalon Well basicly the review descriptions and other like Thesarum have state how talked about how the scene was depicted (twice) with much detail and the reviews also talk about how the MC was struggling with risking himself to help them. I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.   I dont suppose you could provide time stamps to avoid the content? That would be cool.

That would be cool.            Honestly, you shouldn't bother picking this up for your own good. While not every arc in this series (*groan*) has scenes like the first episode, there will be at least two more instances of characters being threatened with rape. There will also be a worse scene where spoiler[Arc and company free pregnant slaves who were implied to have been raped repeatedly over a period of months, if not longer.]   Despite how jovial and even wholesome Arc can be, the actual world is much darker than his perspective usually suggests.   It is actually worse than Goblin Slayer in that it doesn't end at a singular event to set the tone, or imply it without description as in that series's LNs. It happens less as Skeletal Knight goes on, but I can't imagine how taxing it would be to watch while constantly wondering when the other shoe will drop.   It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.

I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.  As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.            If that's true, it's a shame. I don't understand why some writers feel the need to beat audiences over the head with the most viscerally repugnant content they can imagine, especially when they know they're not going to address it in any meaningful way, let alone give it the treatment it deserves. And before someone tries to go there, yes, this applies to gore as well. Spending time to detail the process of someone getting bisected or dismembered or beheaded adds nothing to the story, demonstrates nothing, and shines no light on anything in any sense other than trying to out-shock the last shocking event you think people saw. Generally it seems like over the last 10-15 years you have a number of series saying, ""well, we can't think of any more shockingly graphic death scenes, I guess we'll shock people with sexual assaults instead.""    I'll stop ranting now. I might keep going with the series a while to see how things play out. I assumed the Ep1 situation was a one and done deal, but my hopes for the series have been diminished.

Also eschewing the JP's side hard 2000's era Bishonen seiyuu for all the top male Funimation VA's for the capture targets.   Not that this cast isn't great, but I am kind of missing some of the nice surprises you'd find in a remote recording dub.    Also, Taisho Otome Fairy Tale getting dubbed! Finally! I guess it'll be a full drop eventually.

With Attack on Titan OADs, Funi's licensing announcement was made the same week Japan announced the OAD Archive Blu-ray back in December.   https://twitter.com/anime_shingeki/status/1470061317474361348  https://twitter.com/Funimation/status/1471148141089075213 Last edited by NJ_ on Sat Apr 16, 2022 4:01 pm; edited 1 time in total     Back to top                  iamthevastuniverse    Joined: 11 Nov 2010 		    Posts: 973       Posted: Sat Apr 16, 2022 4:00 pm            I've never heard of Jonathon Rigg looks to be his first ADR directing job.

Also eschewing the JP's side hard 2000's era Bishonen seiyuu for all the top male Funimation VA's for the capture targets.   Not that this cast isn't great, but I am kind of missing some of the nice surprises you'd find in a remote recording dub.    Also, Taisho Otome Fairy Tale getting dubbed! Finally! I guess it'll be a full drop eventually.

With Attack on Titan OADs, Funi's licensing announcement was made the same week Japan announced the OAD Archive Blu-ray back in December.   https://twitter.com/anime_shingeki/status/1470061317474361348  https://twitter.com/Funimation/status/1471148141089075213 Last edited by NJ_ on Sat Apr 16, 2022 4:01 pm; edited 1 time in total     Back to top                  iamthevastuniverse    Joined: 11 Nov 2010 		    Posts: 973       Posted: Sat Apr 16, 2022 4:00 pm            I've never heard of Jonathon Rigg looks to be his first ADR directing job.

News The Unwanted Undead Adventurer Light Novels Get TV Anime   posted on 2022-04-17 21:06 UTC-8 by Egan Loo          Yū Okano's dark fantasy of talentless adventurer reborn as skeleton    The ""Overlap Bunko 9th Anniversary Online Event"" announced on Sunday that a television anime adaptation of  Yū Okano's The Unwanted Undead Adventurer (Nozomanu Fushi no Bōkensha) light novel series has been green-lit.        The novels' illustrator Jaian drew the following illustration to celebrate the news:       J-Novel Club is publishing both the light novel series and the manga adaptation in English, and it describes the dark fantasy story:   Rentt Faina, a twenty-five- year-old adventurer, has been hacking away at monsters for a decade. However, without much talent for the job, Rentt finds himself stuck hunting Slimes and Goblins for meager amounts of coin every day. Little does he know, all this is about to change when he comes across a seemingly undiscovered path in the Labyrinth of the Moon's Reflection.   What awaits him at the end of the path, however, is neither treasure nor riches, but a legendary dragon that wastes no time swallowing him whole! Waking up a short time later, Rentt finds himself not quite dead, but not very alive either— He is nothing more than a pile of bones! Armed with nothing but his trusty sword, tool belt, and ghoulish new looks, Rentt sets off on his quest as a newly reborn Skeleton to achieve Existential Evolution, hoping to one day return to civilization with a more human form.    Will Rentt succeed, or will the labyrinth consume him for the rest of his un-death...?   Okano launched the series on the Shōsetsuka ni Narō website in 2016, and OVERLAP published the first volume with illustrations by Jaian in October 2017. The 10th volume will ship in Japan on April 25.    A manga adaptation by Haiji Nakasone launched on OVERLAP's Comic Gardo website in November 2017. The ninth manga volume will ship in Japan on April 25.

News The Unwanted Undead Adventurer Light Novels Get TV Anime   posted on 2022-04-17 21:06 UTC-8 by Egan Loo          Yū Okano's dark fantasy of talentless adventurer reborn as skeleton    The ""Overlap Bunko 9th Anniversary Online Event"" announced on Sunday that a television anime adaptation of  Yū Okano's The Unwanted Undead Adventurer (Nozomanu Fushi no Bōkensha) light novel series has been green-lit.        The novels' illustrator Jaian drew the following illustration to celebrate the news:       J-Novel Club is publishing both the light novel series and the manga adaptation in English, and it describes the dark fantasy story:   Rentt Faina, a twenty-five- year-old adventurer, has been hacking away at monsters for a decade. However, without much talent for the job, Rentt finds himself stuck hunting Slimes and Goblins for meager amounts of coin every day. Little does he know, all this is about to change when he comes across a seemingly undiscovered path in the Labyrinth of the Moon's Reflection.   What awaits him at the end of the path, however, is neither treasure nor riches, but a legendary dragon that wastes no time swallowing him whole! Waking up a short time later, Rentt finds himself not quite dead, but not very alive either— He is nothing more than a pile of bones! Armed with nothing but his trusty sword, tool belt, and ghoulish new looks, Rentt sets off on his quest as a newly reborn Skeleton to achieve Existential Evolution, hoping to one day return to civilization with a more human form.    Will Rentt succeed, or will the labyrinth consume him for the rest of his un-death...?   Okano launched the series on the Shōsetsuka ni Narō website in 2016, and OVERLAP published the first volume with illustrations by Jaian in October 2017. The 10th volume will ship in Japan on April 25.    A manga adaptation by Haiji Nakasone launched on OVERLAP's Comic Gardo website in November 2017. The ninth manga volume will ship in Japan on April 25.

News The Unwanted Undead Adventurer Light Novels Get TV Anime   posted on 2022-04-17 21:06 UTC-8 by Egan Loo          Yū Okano's dark fantasy of talentless adventurer reborn as skeleton    The ""Overlap Bunko 9th Anniversary Online Event"" announced on Sunday that a television anime adaptation of  Yū Okano's The Unwanted Undead Adventurer (Nozomanu Fushi no Bōkensha) light novel series has been green-lit.        The novels' illustrator Jaian drew the following illustration to celebrate the news:       J-Novel Club is publishing both the light novel series and the manga adaptation in English, and it describes the dark fantasy story:   Rentt Faina, a twenty-five- year-old adventurer, has been hacking away at monsters for a decade. However, without much talent for the job, Rentt finds himself stuck hunting Slimes and Goblins for meager amounts of coin every day. Little does he know, all this is about to change when he comes across a seemingly undiscovered path in the Labyrinth of the Moon's Reflection.   What awaits him at the end of the path, however, is neither treasure nor riches, but a legendary dragon that wastes no time swallowing him whole! Waking up a short time later, Rentt finds himself not quite dead, but not very alive either— He is nothing more than a pile of bones! Armed with nothing but his trusty sword, tool belt, and ghoulish new looks, Rentt sets off on his quest as a newly reborn Skeleton to achieve Existential Evolution, hoping to one day return to civilization with a more human form.    Will Rentt succeed, or will the labyrinth consume him for the rest of his un-death...?   Okano launched the series on the Shōsetsuka ni Narō website in 2016, and OVERLAP published the first volume with illustrations by Jaian in October 2017. The 10th volume will ship in Japan on April 25.    A manga adaptation by Haiji Nakasone launched on OVERLAP's Comic Gardo website in November 2017. The ninth manga volume will ship in Japan on April 25.

The novels' illustrator Jaian drew the following illustration to celebrate the news:       J-Novel Club is publishing both the light novel series and the manga adaptation in English, and it describes the dark fantasy story:   Rentt Faina, a twenty-five- year-old adventurer, has been hacking away at monsters for a decade. However, without much talent for the job, Rentt finds himself stuck hunting Slimes and Goblins for meager amounts of coin every day. Little does he know, all this is about to change when he comes across a seemingly undiscovered path in the Labyrinth of the Moon's Reflection.   What awaits him at the end of the path, however, is neither treasure nor riches, but a legendary dragon that wastes no time swallowing him whole! Waking up a short time later, Rentt finds himself not quite dead, but not very alive either— He is nothing more than a pile of bones! Armed with nothing but his trusty sword, tool belt, and ghoulish new looks, Rentt sets off on his quest as a newly reborn Skeleton to achieve Existential Evolution, hoping to one day return to civilization with a more human form.    Will Rentt succeed, or will the labyrinth consume him for the rest of his un-death...?

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   No sooner has Naofumi settled into his role as the new ruler of Raphtalia's village, that they're beset by an attack from a horde of bat monsters! The timer for the Waves is mysteriously stalled, and a meeting with the other Cardinal Heroes and the Queen reveals the rising of a new threat: The 'Spirit Tortoise' is bringing potential ruin with it, and with the other Heroes opting out of doing anything about it, things naturally fall to Naofumi to take care of things. With new ally (and new slave) Rishia in tow, the Shield Hero's party heads for the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom in order to save the world once again.    The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 is based on Aneko Yusagi's novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?  Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               When last we left off, Naofumi and the others were struggling with the revelation that they were involved in a battle between worlds rather than a simple monster invasion. However, all this is put to the side as a new threat arises, the Spirit Tortoise, whose arrival mysteriously puts a stop to the Waves for the time being.    When it comes down to it, this episode is really only concerned with one thing: exposition. Though we do get two quick action scenes, the thrust of the episode is about establishing the status quo for the arc—i.e., the threat of the turtle—while reminding us of important plot points from the previous season.    Luckily, this is done largely through character building. We see that Naofumi is far from the aggrieved man he was for much of the first season. Becoming the lord of Raphtalia's hometown has tied him irrevocably to the kingdom. While the other heroes still see the fantasy world as a game, to Naofumi it has become his true life filled with things he is driven to protect.    We also spend a lot of time developing Rishia, the newest member of Naofumi's party. She's a young woman in turmoil—in love with a man who has rejected her even though she is dying to be useful to him. But in her, there is potential, though Naofumi and his friends are unsure how to bring it out and what form it will ultimately take. She is an inherently tragic character but through Naofumi's party, it looks like she will be able to become the person she was meant to be. If nothing else, her earnestness makes her easy to root for.    All in all, while this is one of the weaker episodes, it does its job setting up the next arc well enough and gives us some solid character development to boot. Hopefully, things will pick up a bit next episode.      How was the first episode?  Christopher Farris  Rating:               There's the possibility that kicking off a second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero could be a boon for the series. There's a clean break to all the consternation and baggage that fueled the original outing: most of the foundation built on Naofumi's persecution  has cleared up. However, not content with just the one demihuman slave, he now gets to be the ruler of a whole village of demihumans. The world is still besieged by regular monster attacks, which is also now subject to hero-assassination attempts from other worlds. So of course, some new issue inevitably gets foisted into the plot for Naofumi and crew.    There's definitely the sense of a plot-necessity swerve in the development of this premiere episode. The driving force of the entire story of the first season, the Waves, quite literally gets put on pause so the Queen can impart the new issue of a 'Spirit Tortoise' that we haven't heard of before but we're assured is every bit as much a major disaster. It certainly means the episode gets going quickly; we hardly have any time for the sort of reestablishing elements with Naofumi in the demihuman village before suddenly they're beset by random bat monsters brought by the ascension of the evil Turtle Pope. But it also means that parts of the story get back to too-perfunctory Business As Usual for Shield Hero. The other Cardinal Heroes, apparently having learned nothing from the climax of the previous adventure, are still acting like callous jerks to Naofumi and friends, and shrugging off needing to actually do anything about the Spirit Tortoise under the auspices that it's not their job.    So even though Naofumi has more predisposition to help with the situation, the storytelling still oddly proceeds with that sense of begrudgement we're just supposed to expect around him in this story. It's almost unintentionally hilarious, the way both the Queen and later Fitoria act like they need to convince Naofumi to take care of the Spirit Tortoise under duress, despite him immediately agreeing to do so. I know that this sort of disagreeable tone is part-and-parcel to the darker, nihilistic angle of appeal Shield Hero is trying to present in its fantasy world, but it just comes off needlessly enforced when its main character character has no reason to act like the world's against him anymore .    That said, the slack of the struggle in Shield-land is instead picked up in this premiere by Rishia, who ends up with what could be considered the emotional core of this episode. Her persecution by her former party with the Bow Hero definitely reflects Naofumi's own story, to where you can almost hear the author going ""See, I can write a woman who gets put upon and mistreated for unfair reasons too! It's equality!"" Of course the major difference is that when Naofumi was at his lowest point, he was forced to buy a slave, while as Rishia finds herself struggling she is convinced to become a slave and aaaaaawwwwww Christ.    Look, I don't need to get into the weeds on this, we had half a year of slavery discourse with the first Shield Hero season. But it must be said that it comes off as downright undermining that the show ever portrayed the slave trade as this dark, seedy element its hero could turn to out of desperation, when at this point it's mostly just an odd mechanic characters can submit themselves to for in-story power-up convenience and lip service to a fetish that isn't even portrayed half as entertainingly as in other series like How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord. That is to say, Rishia agreeing to become Naofumi's slave for a time doesn't prompt aghast reactions of offense, it simply comes off as eyeroll-worthy.    Regardless, Shield Hero's second season has at least started with plenty of momentum to it, even if some of the new story elements come off like ham-fisted hard-turns. But this is a show that worked better the more it expanded its world-building anyway, so maybe figuring out what the deal with this Spirit Tortoise actually is or seeing how Rishia's development along the way plays out will be to its benefit. The fights we get in this episode featuring our heroes slaughtering their way through Countries both Bat and Donkey Kong are decent, concentrated bursts of action (there's a little bit of shaky CGI, but you know I always love seeing Filo fight in her big, puffy, bird form), and you know Kevin Penkin's score is still pulling its weight. It's the beginning of a second season that seems to be justifying its existence, with all the caveats from however you felt about the original's existence in the first place.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            interview                I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   Apr 18, 21:00                 live-action    This isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work, but his role as the eponymous Aono-kun is something a little different– he's a ghost.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   No sooner has Naofumi settled into his role as the new ruler of Raphtalia's village, that they're beset by an attack from a horde of bat monsters! The timer for the Waves is mysteriously stalled, and a meeting with the other Cardinal Heroes and the Queen reveals the rising of a new threat: The 'Spirit Tortoise' is bringing potential ruin with it, and with the other Heroes opting out of doing anything about it, things naturally fall to Naofumi to take care of things. With new ally (and new slave) Rishia in tow, the Shield Hero's party heads for the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom in order to save the world once again.    The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 is based on Aneko Yusagi's novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?  Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               When last we left off, Naofumi and the others were struggling with the revelation that they were involved in a battle between worlds rather than a simple monster invasion. However, all this is put to the side as a new threat arises, the Spirit Tortoise, whose arrival mysteriously puts a stop to the Waves for the time being.    When it comes down to it, this episode is really only concerned with one thing: exposition. Though we do get two quick action scenes, the thrust of the episode is about establishing the status quo for the arc—i.e., the threat of the turtle—while reminding us of important plot points from the previous season.    Luckily, this is done largely through character building. We see that Naofumi is far from the aggrieved man he was for much of the first season. Becoming the lord of Raphtalia's hometown has tied him irrevocably to the kingdom. While the other heroes still see the fantasy world as a game, to Naofumi it has become his true life filled with things he is driven to protect.    We also spend a lot of time developing Rishia, the newest member of Naofumi's party. She's a young woman in turmoil—in love with a man who has rejected her even though she is dying to be useful to him. But in her, there is potential, though Naofumi and his friends are unsure how to bring it out and what form it will ultimately take. She is an inherently tragic character but through Naofumi's party, it looks like she will be able to become the person she was meant to be. If nothing else, her earnestness makes her easy to root for.    All in all, while this is one of the weaker episodes, it does its job setting up the next arc well enough and gives us some solid character development to boot. Hopefully, things will pick up a bit next episode.      How was the first episode?  Christopher Farris  Rating:               There's the possibility that kicking off a second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero could be a boon for the series. There's a clean break to all the consternation and baggage that fueled the original outing: most of the foundation built on Naofumi's persecution  has cleared up. However, not content with just the one demihuman slave, he now gets to be the ruler of a whole village of demihumans. The world is still besieged by regular monster attacks, which is also now subject to hero-assassination attempts from other worlds. So of course, some new issue inevitably gets foisted into the plot for Naofumi and crew.    There's definitely the sense of a plot-necessity swerve in the development of this premiere episode. The driving force of the entire story of the first season, the Waves, quite literally gets put on pause so the Queen can impart the new issue of a 'Spirit Tortoise' that we haven't heard of before but we're assured is every bit as much a major disaster. It certainly means the episode gets going quickly; we hardly have any time for the sort of reestablishing elements with Naofumi in the demihuman village before suddenly they're beset by random bat monsters brought by the ascension of the evil Turtle Pope. But it also means that parts of the story get back to too-perfunctory Business As Usual for Shield Hero. The other Cardinal Heroes, apparently having learned nothing from the climax of the previous adventure, are still acting like callous jerks to Naofumi and friends, and shrugging off needing to actually do anything about the Spirit Tortoise under the auspices that it's not their job.    So even though Naofumi has more predisposition to help with the situation, the storytelling still oddly proceeds with that sense of begrudgement we're just supposed to expect around him in this story. It's almost unintentionally hilarious, the way both the Queen and later Fitoria act like they need to convince Naofumi to take care of the Spirit Tortoise under duress, despite him immediately agreeing to do so. I know that this sort of disagreeable tone is part-and-parcel to the darker, nihilistic angle of appeal Shield Hero is trying to present in its fantasy world, but it just comes off needlessly enforced when its main character character has no reason to act like the world's against him anymore .    That said, the slack of the struggle in Shield-land is instead picked up in this premiere by Rishia, who ends up with what could be considered the emotional core of this episode. Her persecution by her former party with the Bow Hero definitely reflects Naofumi's own story, to where you can almost hear the author going ""See, I can write a woman who gets put upon and mistreated for unfair reasons too! It's equality!"" Of course the major difference is that when Naofumi was at his lowest point, he was forced to buy a slave, while as Rishia finds herself struggling she is convinced to become a slave and aaaaaawwwwww Christ.    Look, I don't need to get into the weeds on this, we had half a year of slavery discourse with the first Shield Hero season. But it must be said that it comes off as downright undermining that the show ever portrayed the slave trade as this dark, seedy element its hero could turn to out of desperation, when at this point it's mostly just an odd mechanic characters can submit themselves to for in-story power-up convenience and lip service to a fetish that isn't even portrayed half as entertainingly as in other series like How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord. That is to say, Rishia agreeing to become Naofumi's slave for a time doesn't prompt aghast reactions of offense, it simply comes off as eyeroll-worthy.    Regardless, Shield Hero's second season has at least started with plenty of momentum to it, even if some of the new story elements come off like ham-fisted hard-turns. But this is a show that worked better the more it expanded its world-building anyway, so maybe figuring out what the deal with this Spirit Tortoise actually is or seeing how Rishia's development along the way plays out will be to its benefit. The fights we get in this episode featuring our heroes slaughtering their way through Countries both Bat and Donkey Kong are decent, concentrated bursts of action (there's a little bit of shaky CGI, but you know I always love seeing Filo fight in her big, puffy, bird form), and you know Kevin Penkin's score is still pulling its weight. It's the beginning of a second season that seems to be justifying its existence, with all the caveats from however you felt about the original's existence in the first place.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            interview                I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   Apr 18, 21:00                 live-action    This isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work, but his role as the eponymous Aono-kun is something a little different– he's a ghost.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   No sooner has Naofumi settled into his role as the new ruler of Raphtalia's village, that they're beset by an attack from a horde of bat monsters! The timer for the Waves is mysteriously stalled, and a meeting with the other Cardinal Heroes and the Queen reveals the rising of a new threat: The 'Spirit Tortoise' is bringing potential ruin with it, and with the other Heroes opting out of doing anything about it, things naturally fall to Naofumi to take care of things. With new ally (and new slave) Rishia in tow, the Shield Hero's party heads for the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom in order to save the world once again.    The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 is based on Aneko Yusagi's novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?  Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               When last we left off, Naofumi and the others were struggling with the revelation that they were involved in a battle between worlds rather than a simple monster invasion. However, all this is put to the side as a new threat arises, the Spirit Tortoise, whose arrival mysteriously puts a stop to the Waves for the time being.    When it comes down to it, this episode is really only concerned with one thing: exposition. Though we do get two quick action scenes, the thrust of the episode is about establishing the status quo for the arc—i.e., the threat of the turtle—while reminding us of important plot points from the previous season.    Luckily, this is done largely through character building. We see that Naofumi is far from the aggrieved man he was for much of the first season. Becoming the lord of Raphtalia's hometown has tied him irrevocably to the kingdom. While the other heroes still see the fantasy world as a game, to Naofumi it has become his true life filled with things he is driven to protect.    We also spend a lot of time developing Rishia, the newest member of Naofumi's party. She's a young woman in turmoil—in love with a man who has rejected her even though she is dying to be useful to him. But in her, there is potential, though Naofumi and his friends are unsure how to bring it out and what form it will ultimately take. She is an inherently tragic character but through Naofumi's party, it looks like she will be able to become the person she was meant to be. If nothing else, her earnestness makes her easy to root for.    All in all, while this is one of the weaker episodes, it does its job setting up the next arc well enough and gives us some solid character development to boot. Hopefully, things will pick up a bit next episode.      How was the first episode?  Christopher Farris  Rating:               There's the possibility that kicking off a second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero could be a boon for the series. There's a clean break to all the consternation and baggage that fueled the original outing: most of the foundation built on Naofumi's persecution  has cleared up. However, not content with just the one demihuman slave, he now gets to be the ruler of a whole village of demihumans. The world is still besieged by regular monster attacks, which is also now subject to hero-assassination attempts from other worlds. So of course, some new issue inevitably gets foisted into the plot for Naofumi and crew.    There's definitely the sense of a plot-necessity swerve in the development of this premiere episode. The driving force of the entire story of the first season, the Waves, quite literally gets put on pause so the Queen can impart the new issue of a 'Spirit Tortoise' that we haven't heard of before but we're assured is every bit as much a major disaster. It certainly means the episode gets going quickly; we hardly have any time for the sort of reestablishing elements with Naofumi in the demihuman village before suddenly they're beset by random bat monsters brought by the ascension of the evil Turtle Pope. But it also means that parts of the story get back to too-perfunctory Business As Usual for Shield Hero. The other Cardinal Heroes, apparently having learned nothing from the climax of the previous adventure, are still acting like callous jerks to Naofumi and friends, and shrugging off needing to actually do anything about the Spirit Tortoise under the auspices that it's not their job.    So even though Naofumi has more predisposition to help with the situation, the storytelling still oddly proceeds with that sense of begrudgement we're just supposed to expect around him in this story. It's almost unintentionally hilarious, the way both the Queen and later Fitoria act like they need to convince Naofumi to take care of the Spirit Tortoise under duress, despite him immediately agreeing to do so. I know that this sort of disagreeable tone is part-and-parcel to the darker, nihilistic angle of appeal Shield Hero is trying to present in its fantasy world, but it just comes off needlessly enforced when its main character character has no reason to act like the world's against him anymore .    That said, the slack of the struggle in Shield-land is instead picked up in this premiere by Rishia, who ends up with what could be considered the emotional core of this episode. Her persecution by her former party with the Bow Hero definitely reflects Naofumi's own story, to where you can almost hear the author going ""See, I can write a woman who gets put upon and mistreated for unfair reasons too! It's equality!"" Of course the major difference is that when Naofumi was at his lowest point, he was forced to buy a slave, while as Rishia finds herself struggling she is convinced to become a slave and aaaaaawwwwww Christ.    Look, I don't need to get into the weeds on this, we had half a year of slavery discourse with the first Shield Hero season. But it must be said that it comes off as downright undermining that the show ever portrayed the slave trade as this dark, seedy element its hero could turn to out of desperation, when at this point it's mostly just an odd mechanic characters can submit themselves to for in-story power-up convenience and lip service to a fetish that isn't even portrayed half as entertainingly as in other series like How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord. That is to say, Rishia agreeing to become Naofumi's slave for a time doesn't prompt aghast reactions of offense, it simply comes off as eyeroll-worthy.    Regardless, Shield Hero's second season has at least started with plenty of momentum to it, even if some of the new story elements come off like ham-fisted hard-turns. But this is a show that worked better the more it expanded its world-building anyway, so maybe figuring out what the deal with this Spirit Tortoise actually is or seeing how Rishia's development along the way plays out will be to its benefit. The fights we get in this episode featuring our heroes slaughtering their way through Countries both Bat and Donkey Kong are decent, concentrated bursts of action (there's a little bit of shaky CGI, but you know I always love seeing Filo fight in her big, puffy, bird form), and you know Kevin Penkin's score is still pulling its weight. It's the beginning of a second season that seems to be justifying its existence, with all the caveats from however you felt about the original's existence in the first place.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            interview                I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   Apr 18, 21:00                 live-action    This isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work, but his role as the eponymous Aono-kun is something a little different– he's a ghost.

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            interview                I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   Apr 18, 21:00                 live-action    This isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work, but his role as the eponymous Aono-kun is something a little different– he's a ghost.

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            interview                I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   Apr 18, 21:00                 live-action    This isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work, but his role as the eponymous Aono-kun is something a little different– he's a ghost.

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            interview                I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   Apr 18, 21:00                 live-action    This isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work, but his role as the eponymous Aono-kun is something a little different– he's a ghost.

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            interview                I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   Apr 18, 21:00                 live-action    This isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work, but his role as the eponymous Aono-kun is something a little different– he's a ghost.

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

18-04-2022,anime,7,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/aoashi/.183645,Aoashi - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"    The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aoashi   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aoashi ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows.

The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.

18-04-2022,anime,7,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/aoashi/.183645,Aoashi - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Aoashi ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming.
