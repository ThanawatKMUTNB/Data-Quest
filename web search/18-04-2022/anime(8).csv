Streaming                     Synopsis:             After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.      Review:         Synopsis:        After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.     Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.             Grade:      Overall (sub) : C Story : C- Animation : B- Art : B- Music : C  + Decent premise and character designs, a few interesting story elements. − Premise and plot aren't used well in favor of cramming in too many popular bits and pieces, story doesn't develop fully. Some baffling uniform designs and perspective issues.

Streaming                     Synopsis:             After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.      Review:         Synopsis:        After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.     Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.             Grade:      Overall (sub) : C Story : C- Animation : B- Art : B- Music : C  + Decent premise and character designs, a few interesting story elements. − Premise and plot aren't used well in favor of cramming in too many popular bits and pieces, story doesn't develop fully. Some baffling uniform designs and perspective issues.

Streaming                     Synopsis:             After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.      Review:         Synopsis:        After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.     Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.

He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.     Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.             Grade:      Overall (sub) : C Story : C- Animation : B- Art : B- Music : C  + Decent premise and character designs, a few interesting story elements. − Premise and plot aren't used well in favor of cramming in too many popular bits and pieces, story doesn't develop fully.

The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them.

Review:         Synopsis:        After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.     Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.

Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.

He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.

Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play.

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   by Daniel DeLorme, Apr  6th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

With the last episode duplicated in the ""final ep."" column, it means that the votes for the last episode of each series are counted twice, which intentionally gives a boost to series that ended strongly. This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.  So this is it, the final ranking, the winners and losers of the Winter 2022 season.

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 24          Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            interview                I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   Apr 18, 21:00                 live-action    This isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work, but his role as the eponymous Aono-kun is something a little different– he's a ghost.

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   by Daniel DeLorme, Apr  6th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

With the last episode duplicated in the ""final ep."" column, it means that the votes for the last episode of each series are counted twice, which intentionally gives a boost to series that ended strongly. This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 24          Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            interview                I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   Apr 18, 21:00                 live-action    This isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work, but his role as the eponymous Aono-kun is something a little different– he's a ghost.

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   by Daniel DeLorme, Apr  6th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

With the last episode duplicated in the ""final ep."" column, it means that the votes for the last episode of each series are counted twice, which intentionally gives a boost to series that ended strongly. This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.  So this is it, the final ranking, the winners and losers of the Winter 2022 season.

ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            interview                I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   Apr 18, 21:00                 live-action    This isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work, but his role as the eponymous Aono-kun is something a little different– he's a ghost.

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   by Daniel DeLorme, Apr  6th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

With the last episode duplicated in the ""final ep."" column, it means that the votes for the last episode of each series are counted twice, which intentionally gives a boost to series that ended strongly. This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   by Daniel DeLorme, Apr  6th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

With the last episode duplicated in the ""final ep."" column, it means that the votes for the last episode of each series are counted twice, which intentionally gives a boost to series that ended strongly. This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 24          Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method': 1}"

This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.

Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder.

This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.

This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating.

Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder.

It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating.

Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder.

With the last episode duplicated in the ""final ep."" column, it means that the votes for the last episode of each series are counted twice, which intentionally gives a boost to series that ended strongly. This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.  So this is it, the final ranking, the winners and losers of the Winter 2022 season.

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 24          Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.

In other words, these are the titles that many people agree are awful.

Titles with less than 4 votes are removed from the list but are still counted in the ranking. This explains why there may be gaps in the ""#"" column.

Titles with many votes will tend to be at the top, but this is modified a little by the ratings. In other words, the popularity is the straight average score of a title (the value in the rating column) multiplied by the number of votes.

The rating displayed here is the same weighted average as the Top 10 Best Rated by weighted average, but is only displayed for reference and doesn't have anything to do with the order of the titles.

Titles with less than 4 votes are removed from the list but are still counted in the ranking. This explains why there may be gaps in the ""#"" column.

Titles with many votes will tend to be at the top, but this is modified a little by the ratings. In other words, the popularity is the straight average score of a title (the value in the rating column) multiplied by the number of votes.

Titles with many votes will tend to be at the top, but this is modified a little by the ratings. In other words, the popularity is the straight average score of a title (the value in the rating column) multiplied by the number of votes.

News Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer Anime Reveals 24 More Cast Members, July Premiere   posted on 2022-04-17 11:06 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          M.A.O, Tetsu Inada, Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, more join cast    A livestream event for the television anime of Satoshi Mizukami's Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer (Hoshi no Samidare) manga revealed 24 more cast members for the anime on Saturday. The event also revealed a new visual and the show's July premiere on MBS and TBS' ""Animeism"" programming block and on BS11.     The additional cast includes:    M.A.O as Anima   Tatsumaru Tachibana as Animus   Shuuhei Iwase as Hangetsu Shinonome   Gen Sato as Mikazuki Shinonome   Tetsu Inada as Sōichirō Nagumo   Aya Suzaki as Yayoi Hakudō   Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as Hyō Shimaki   Shunichi Toki as Tarō Kusakabe   Chinatsu Hirose as Hanako Sorano   Chihaya Yoshitake as Subaru Hoshikawa   Moeha Nochimoto as Yuimachi Tsukishiro   Mutsumi Tamura as Taiyō Akane   Kazuhiro Yamaji as Inachika Akitani   Shōya Ishige as ludo Shubarie   Atsuko Tanaka as Muu   Kentarō Kumagai as Dance Dark   Hyousei as Shea Moon   Nagisa Kakegawa as Coo Ritter   Kazutomi Yamamoto as Lance Lumiere   Ruriko Aoki as Kil Zonne   Mitsuo Iwata as Lee Soleil   Katsuji Mori as Ron Yue   Manabu Muraji as Loki Helios   Tetsuei Sumiya as Zan Amaru    The previously revealed cast members include:    Junya Enoki as Yuuhi Amamiya   Naomi Ōzora as Samidare Asahina   Kenjiro Tsuda as Noi Crezant   Azusa Tadokoro as Hisame Asahina    Nobuaki Nakanishi (Koihime Musō, Mahōjin Guru Guru, Kasimasi - Girl Meets Girl) is directing the anime. Original author Mizukami is credited for series composition, alongside Yūichirō Momose (My First Girlfriend is a Gal, Infinite Dendrogram, So I'm a Spider, So What?).    Mizukami's comment on the anime's announcement indicated that the anime will cover the entire manga ""until the end.""    Mizukami (Spirit Circle, Planet With) launched the manga in Shonengahosha's Young King Ours magazine in April 2005, and ended it in 2010. JManga once carried the manga, and Seven Seas Entertainment later licensed and released the manga in print in North America. Crunchyroll also published the manga digitally. Crunchyroll describes manga's story:    Asamiya Yuuhi was an ordinary college student... until the day a lizard showed up and asked him to help save the world. The next thing he knows, he's been given a ring and special powers, plus an enemy stalking him. However, he's saved in the nick of time by the Girl Next Door, Samidare, who's planning... WHAT kinds of things?! This is an unconventional story that mixes ordinary life with the bizarre and supernatural!

The event also revealed a new visual and the show's July premiere on MBS and TBS' ""Animeism"" programming block and on BS11.

Original author Mizukami is credited for series composition, alongside Yūichirō Momose (My First Girlfriend is a Gal, Infinite Dendrogram, So I'm a Spider, So What?).    Mizukami's comment on the anime's announcement indicated that the anime will cover the entire manga ""until the end.""    Mizukami (Spirit Circle, Planet With) launched the manga in Shonengahosha's Young King Ours magazine in April 2005, and ended it in 2010. JManga once carried the manga, and Seven Seas Entertainment later licensed and released the manga in print in North America. Crunchyroll also published the manga digitally. Crunchyroll describes manga's story:    Asamiya Yuuhi was an ordinary college student... until the day a lizard showed up and asked him to help save the world. The next thing he knows, he's been given a ring and special powers, plus an enemy stalking him. However, he's saved in the nick of time by the Girl Next Door, Samidare, who's planning... WHAT kinds of things?! This is an unconventional story that mixes ordinary life with the bizarre and supernatural!
