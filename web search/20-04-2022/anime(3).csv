Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episodes 28-29  by Christopher Farris, Apr 17th 2022                   How would you rate episode 28 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 29 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.4            After a pair of mostly-flashback episodes focused on everyone's favorite battle bros, it's time for Legend of the Galactic Heroes to get back to what it's more known for: Politicking! Four weeks might seem like a while to take to show the effects of the societal upheavals brought about by the resolution of the previous major arc, but this is LOGH, it takes its time. That said, these episodes give off the impression that the team handling these movies knew they had to put some more...traditionally exciting material like spaceship battles and classist intrigue up-front, since what actually advances the story here can hardly be considered white-knuckle popcorn entertainment material.    A lot of that's just the nature of the beast. When Yoshiki Tanaka isn't portraying the unfolding of excitingly clever military strategies, he's waxing about political philosophy through the lens of historical context. So it goes that much of the 28th episode of DNT is dedicated to showing us what the Empire under the rule of Reinhard actually looks like. At first it appears they might be taking a brisk, structurally-clever tack at communicating that to us, as we actually hear about Reinhard's reforms and how well-received they are via the Alliance, getting an earful from their new prisoners regarding how awesome Reinhard is. It's a unique way of utilizing the two sides of the narrative, and allows us to have Yang on hand to explain what Reinhard's nascent brand of 'Liberal Imperialism' might actually mean for such rule in the long-term.    Of course, the subject of imperialism, dictatorships (benevolent and not), and how that works with populistic will is a subject that's only going to encompass LOGH's thematic storytelling more and more as it goes on. For the time being though, we have the benefit of Yang's own historical context for all this happening to set the stage, as it's made extremely clear that the benefits the people are experiencing in the moment are tied exclusively to that moment and the whims of their new leader. And don't worry if you didn't catch that, because the show will be happy to reiterate it again later in the same episode.    Otherwise, it's an episode that tries to show off the effects of the reforms from all angles, possibly even attempting to provoke a reaction from a receptive audience. It's easy to sympathize with Reinhard's particular brand of consolidated leadership when it also results in redistributing wealth from those wealthy nobles LOGH loves roasting so much, or relieving penalties for speaking out against the government itself. But shows of changes in the atmosphere of the Empire only goes so far when the anime's storytelling is still basically in Civics Textbook mode, repeatedly panning over scenes of these societal effects with some narrative explanation, only loosely connected with the somewhat clunky visual device of a stray dog that will eventually be adopted by Oberstein. See, everyone else tried to feed the dog with the spoils of their reformed government, but it wouldn't accept them, and only Oberstein knew what it actually wanted and needed to sate its hunger, get it?    I need to stress that I already love the ideas LOGH is playing with as this part of the story gets underway. It's a strong prompt for the audience, the question of if such a benevolent dictatorship is only preferable in comparison to the repression of the previous administration. We know from his past that Reinhard personally believes in the principles behind these reforms, but that's complicated by the fact that he's clearly also implementing them as a conscious power-play for uses he knows he'll need later. It's conceptually fascinating and stimulating – and it really is the sort of thing that works better in written form rather than trying to watch it play out as an episode of television. All the attractive background art in the world can't punch up the debate-club arguments that are, for the moment, only tangentially important to the progressing plot at hand. In that respect, LOGH DNT is lucky it does look nice and its ideas are actually salient, as so many other shows have been doomed by their lesser efforts attempting this similar staid structure.    That said, such a problem is possibly more pronounced in the 29th episode. Whereas the previous one was a demonstration of the effects of external politicking, this one turns its focus on internal politicking. Huge amounts of its exposition are focused on the reasoning for characters being put in particular command positions for what the actual narrative focus of this part of the story is: The modification and warping of Geiersberg Fortress to retake Iserlohn. I think there is something to appreciate in part of the setup here necessitating a recap of some of the events and status quo from earlier in the series (it has been a while, with several gaps, and LOGH isn't known for not having a lot going on). But that bleeds into the storytelling for the whole episode itself, as so much of it, similarly to that last one, consists of explanations of things that are happening, backed by characters explaining why it is happening. Again, some of the framing of the production looks nice, but compared to that dramatic Mittermeyer and Reuenthal plot, or the premiere Julian episode, this is definitely more the dry, over-explanatory LOGH preceded by its reputation.    It doesn't all have to be this way. Some of the framing material for this one goes the appreciable route of focusing on the families of characters. There's a check-in with Kempff, who will be commanding the Iserlohn-recapturing mission, and his wife and kids, with some reflection on his previous preference for participating in direct combat, and how his relative safety in a commanding position is appreciated in comparison to that. Then, at the end of the episode, we shift over to Yang and Julian visiting with Caselne and his family, prompting discussion of Yang's own seeming flippance towards his safety within and without the Alliance organization. It's strong stuff that both articulates a concept and characterizes the people in this story, but even these parts feel like 50% story recap and theoretical sociological discussions. The apex of this issue is the episode's attempts to focus on Reinhard; as the narration drones on about all the impact the preceding plots have had on his personality, complete with flowery metaphors, we simply watch him stone-facedly going about his business. It nearly comes off like an audio-book of the material at times, which is decidedly not the vibe you want a fancy theatrical animated adaptation to have.    So much of this is seeding for all those forthcoming plot lines, so it's necessary one way or the other. But LOGH can and has done better, in this incarnation and others. This comes off too much like the dry, impersonal handling of the material I know DNT has struggled with on and off through its history, exacerbated by the base story material still being strong, alongside flashes of more intimate personal potential. It reaches a 'hope for the best' apex, that the series' more effective dramatic elements from the episodes before these ones can intersect with the way the story has otherwise picked up, and deliver on the impact we know it's supposed to have once it gets going. Our thought experiments based on its political-theory debate prompts can't keep doing all the heavy lifting.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episodes 28-29  by Christopher Farris, Apr 17th 2022                   How would you rate episode 28 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 29 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.4            After a pair of mostly-flashback episodes focused on everyone's favorite battle bros, it's time for Legend of the Galactic Heroes to get back to what it's more known for: Politicking! Four weeks might seem like a while to take to show the effects of the societal upheavals brought about by the resolution of the previous major arc, but this is LOGH, it takes its time. That said, these episodes give off the impression that the team handling these movies knew they had to put some more...traditionally exciting material like spaceship battles and classist intrigue up-front, since what actually advances the story here can hardly be considered white-knuckle popcorn entertainment material.    A lot of that's just the nature of the beast. When Yoshiki Tanaka isn't portraying the unfolding of excitingly clever military strategies, he's waxing about political philosophy through the lens of historical context. So it goes that much of the 28th episode of DNT is dedicated to showing us what the Empire under the rule of Reinhard actually looks like. At first it appears they might be taking a brisk, structurally-clever tack at communicating that to us, as we actually hear about Reinhard's reforms and how well-received they are via the Alliance, getting an earful from their new prisoners regarding how awesome Reinhard is. It's a unique way of utilizing the two sides of the narrative, and allows us to have Yang on hand to explain what Reinhard's nascent brand of 'Liberal Imperialism' might actually mean for such rule in the long-term.    Of course, the subject of imperialism, dictatorships (benevolent and not), and how that works with populistic will is a subject that's only going to encompass LOGH's thematic storytelling more and more as it goes on. For the time being though, we have the benefit of Yang's own historical context for all this happening to set the stage, as it's made extremely clear that the benefits the people are experiencing in the moment are tied exclusively to that moment and the whims of their new leader. And don't worry if you didn't catch that, because the show will be happy to reiterate it again later in the same episode.    Otherwise, it's an episode that tries to show off the effects of the reforms from all angles, possibly even attempting to provoke a reaction from a receptive audience. It's easy to sympathize with Reinhard's particular brand of consolidated leadership when it also results in redistributing wealth from those wealthy nobles LOGH loves roasting so much, or relieving penalties for speaking out against the government itself. But shows of changes in the atmosphere of the Empire only goes so far when the anime's storytelling is still basically in Civics Textbook mode, repeatedly panning over scenes of these societal effects with some narrative explanation, only loosely connected with the somewhat clunky visual device of a stray dog that will eventually be adopted by Oberstein. See, everyone else tried to feed the dog with the spoils of their reformed government, but it wouldn't accept them, and only Oberstein knew what it actually wanted and needed to sate its hunger, get it?    I need to stress that I already love the ideas LOGH is playing with as this part of the story gets underway. It's a strong prompt for the audience, the question of if such a benevolent dictatorship is only preferable in comparison to the repression of the previous administration. We know from his past that Reinhard personally believes in the principles behind these reforms, but that's complicated by the fact that he's clearly also implementing them as a conscious power-play for uses he knows he'll need later. It's conceptually fascinating and stimulating – and it really is the sort of thing that works better in written form rather than trying to watch it play out as an episode of television. All the attractive background art in the world can't punch up the debate-club arguments that are, for the moment, only tangentially important to the progressing plot at hand. In that respect, LOGH DNT is lucky it does look nice and its ideas are actually salient, as so many other shows have been doomed by their lesser efforts attempting this similar staid structure.    That said, such a problem is possibly more pronounced in the 29th episode. Whereas the previous one was a demonstration of the effects of external politicking, this one turns its focus on internal politicking. Huge amounts of its exposition are focused on the reasoning for characters being put in particular command positions for what the actual narrative focus of this part of the story is: The modification and warping of Geiersberg Fortress to retake Iserlohn. I think there is something to appreciate in part of the setup here necessitating a recap of some of the events and status quo from earlier in the series (it has been a while, with several gaps, and LOGH isn't known for not having a lot going on). But that bleeds into the storytelling for the whole episode itself, as so much of it, similarly to that last one, consists of explanations of things that are happening, backed by characters explaining why it is happening. Again, some of the framing of the production looks nice, but compared to that dramatic Mittermeyer and Reuenthal plot, or the premiere Julian episode, this is definitely more the dry, over-explanatory LOGH preceded by its reputation.    It doesn't all have to be this way. Some of the framing material for this one goes the appreciable route of focusing on the families of characters. There's a check-in with Kempff, who will be commanding the Iserlohn-recapturing mission, and his wife and kids, with some reflection on his previous preference for participating in direct combat, and how his relative safety in a commanding position is appreciated in comparison to that. Then, at the end of the episode, we shift over to Yang and Julian visiting with Caselne and his family, prompting discussion of Yang's own seeming flippance towards his safety within and without the Alliance organization. It's strong stuff that both articulates a concept and characterizes the people in this story, but even these parts feel like 50% story recap and theoretical sociological discussions. The apex of this issue is the episode's attempts to focus on Reinhard; as the narration drones on about all the impact the preceding plots have had on his personality, complete with flowery metaphors, we simply watch him stone-facedly going about his business. It nearly comes off like an audio-book of the material at times, which is decidedly not the vibe you want a fancy theatrical animated adaptation to have.    So much of this is seeding for all those forthcoming plot lines, so it's necessary one way or the other. But LOGH can and has done better, in this incarnation and others. This comes off too much like the dry, impersonal handling of the material I know DNT has struggled with on and off through its history, exacerbated by the base story material still being strong, alongside flashes of more intimate personal potential. It reaches a 'hope for the best' apex, that the series' more effective dramatic elements from the episodes before these ones can intersect with the way the story has otherwise picked up, and deliver on the impact we know it's supposed to have once it gets going. Our thought experiments based on its political-theory debate prompts can't keep doing all the heavy lifting.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episodes 28-29  by Christopher Farris, Apr 17th 2022                   How would you rate episode 28 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 29 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.4            After a pair of mostly-flashback episodes focused on everyone's favorite battle bros, it's time for Legend of the Galactic Heroes to get back to what it's more known for: Politicking! Four weeks might seem like a while to take to show the effects of the societal upheavals brought about by the resolution of the previous major arc, but this is LOGH, it takes its time. That said, these episodes give off the impression that the team handling these movies knew they had to put some more...traditionally exciting material like spaceship battles and classist intrigue up-front, since what actually advances the story here can hardly be considered white-knuckle popcorn entertainment material.    A lot of that's just the nature of the beast. When Yoshiki Tanaka isn't portraying the unfolding of excitingly clever military strategies, he's waxing about political philosophy through the lens of historical context. So it goes that much of the 28th episode of DNT is dedicated to showing us what the Empire under the rule of Reinhard actually looks like. At first it appears they might be taking a brisk, structurally-clever tack at communicating that to us, as we actually hear about Reinhard's reforms and how well-received they are via the Alliance, getting an earful from their new prisoners regarding how awesome Reinhard is. It's a unique way of utilizing the two sides of the narrative, and allows us to have Yang on hand to explain what Reinhard's nascent brand of 'Liberal Imperialism' might actually mean for such rule in the long-term.    Of course, the subject of imperialism, dictatorships (benevolent and not), and how that works with populistic will is a subject that's only going to encompass LOGH's thematic storytelling more and more as it goes on. For the time being though, we have the benefit of Yang's own historical context for all this happening to set the stage, as it's made extremely clear that the benefits the people are experiencing in the moment are tied exclusively to that moment and the whims of their new leader. And don't worry if you didn't catch that, because the show will be happy to reiterate it again later in the same episode.    Otherwise, it's an episode that tries to show off the effects of the reforms from all angles, possibly even attempting to provoke a reaction from a receptive audience. It's easy to sympathize with Reinhard's particular brand of consolidated leadership when it also results in redistributing wealth from those wealthy nobles LOGH loves roasting so much, or relieving penalties for speaking out against the government itself. But shows of changes in the atmosphere of the Empire only goes so far when the anime's storytelling is still basically in Civics Textbook mode, repeatedly panning over scenes of these societal effects with some narrative explanation, only loosely connected with the somewhat clunky visual device of a stray dog that will eventually be adopted by Oberstein. See, everyone else tried to feed the dog with the spoils of their reformed government, but it wouldn't accept them, and only Oberstein knew what it actually wanted and needed to sate its hunger, get it?    I need to stress that I already love the ideas LOGH is playing with as this part of the story gets underway. It's a strong prompt for the audience, the question of if such a benevolent dictatorship is only preferable in comparison to the repression of the previous administration. We know from his past that Reinhard personally believes in the principles behind these reforms, but that's complicated by the fact that he's clearly also implementing them as a conscious power-play for uses he knows he'll need later. It's conceptually fascinating and stimulating – and it really is the sort of thing that works better in written form rather than trying to watch it play out as an episode of television. All the attractive background art in the world can't punch up the debate-club arguments that are, for the moment, only tangentially important to the progressing plot at hand. In that respect, LOGH DNT is lucky it does look nice and its ideas are actually salient, as so many other shows have been doomed by their lesser efforts attempting this similar staid structure.    That said, such a problem is possibly more pronounced in the 29th episode. Whereas the previous one was a demonstration of the effects of external politicking, this one turns its focus on internal politicking. Huge amounts of its exposition are focused on the reasoning for characters being put in particular command positions for what the actual narrative focus of this part of the story is: The modification and warping of Geiersberg Fortress to retake Iserlohn. I think there is something to appreciate in part of the setup here necessitating a recap of some of the events and status quo from earlier in the series (it has been a while, with several gaps, and LOGH isn't known for not having a lot going on). But that bleeds into the storytelling for the whole episode itself, as so much of it, similarly to that last one, consists of explanations of things that are happening, backed by characters explaining why it is happening. Again, some of the framing of the production looks nice, but compared to that dramatic Mittermeyer and Reuenthal plot, or the premiere Julian episode, this is definitely more the dry, over-explanatory LOGH preceded by its reputation.    It doesn't all have to be this way. Some of the framing material for this one goes the appreciable route of focusing on the families of characters. There's a check-in with Kempff, who will be commanding the Iserlohn-recapturing mission, and his wife and kids, with some reflection on his previous preference for participating in direct combat, and how his relative safety in a commanding position is appreciated in comparison to that. Then, at the end of the episode, we shift over to Yang and Julian visiting with Caselne and his family, prompting discussion of Yang's own seeming flippance towards his safety within and without the Alliance organization. It's strong stuff that both articulates a concept and characterizes the people in this story, but even these parts feel like 50% story recap and theoretical sociological discussions. The apex of this issue is the episode's attempts to focus on Reinhard; as the narration drones on about all the impact the preceding plots have had on his personality, complete with flowery metaphors, we simply watch him stone-facedly going about his business. It nearly comes off like an audio-book of the material at times, which is decidedly not the vibe you want a fancy theatrical animated adaptation to have.    So much of this is seeding for all those forthcoming plot lines, so it's necessary one way or the other. But LOGH can and has done better, in this incarnation and others. This comes off too much like the dry, impersonal handling of the material I know DNT has struggled with on and off through its history, exacerbated by the base story material still being strong, alongside flashes of more intimate personal potential. It reaches a 'hope for the best' apex, that the series' more effective dramatic elements from the episodes before these ones can intersect with the way the story has otherwise picked up, and deliver on the impact we know it's supposed to have once it gets going. Our thought experiments based on its political-theory debate prompts can't keep doing all the heavy lifting.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episodes 28-29  by Christopher Farris, Apr 17th 2022                   How would you rate episode 28 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 29 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.4            After a pair of mostly-flashback episodes focused on everyone's favorite battle bros, it's time for Legend of the Galactic Heroes to get back to what it's more known for: Politicking! Four weeks might seem like a while to take to show the effects of the societal upheavals brought about by the resolution of the previous major arc, but this is LOGH, it takes its time. That said, these episodes give off the impression that the team handling these movies knew they had to put some more...traditionally exciting material like spaceship battles and classist intrigue up-front, since what actually advances the story here can hardly be considered white-knuckle popcorn entertainment material.    A lot of that's just the nature of the beast. When Yoshiki Tanaka isn't portraying the unfolding of excitingly clever military strategies, he's waxing about political philosophy through the lens of historical context. So it goes that much of the 28th episode of DNT is dedicated to showing us what the Empire under the rule of Reinhard actually looks like. At first it appears they might be taking a brisk, structurally-clever tack at communicating that to us, as we actually hear about Reinhard's reforms and how well-received they are via the Alliance, getting an earful from their new prisoners regarding how awesome Reinhard is. It's a unique way of utilizing the two sides of the narrative, and allows us to have Yang on hand to explain what Reinhard's nascent brand of 'Liberal Imperialism' might actually mean for such rule in the long-term.    Of course, the subject of imperialism, dictatorships (benevolent and not), and how that works with populistic will is a subject that's only going to encompass LOGH's thematic storytelling more and more as it goes on. For the time being though, we have the benefit of Yang's own historical context for all this happening to set the stage, as it's made extremely clear that the benefits the people are experiencing in the moment are tied exclusively to that moment and the whims of their new leader. And don't worry if you didn't catch that, because the show will be happy to reiterate it again later in the same episode.    Otherwise, it's an episode that tries to show off the effects of the reforms from all angles, possibly even attempting to provoke a reaction from a receptive audience. It's easy to sympathize with Reinhard's particular brand of consolidated leadership when it also results in redistributing wealth from those wealthy nobles LOGH loves roasting so much, or relieving penalties for speaking out against the government itself. But shows of changes in the atmosphere of the Empire only goes so far when the anime's storytelling is still basically in Civics Textbook mode, repeatedly panning over scenes of these societal effects with some narrative explanation, only loosely connected with the somewhat clunky visual device of a stray dog that will eventually be adopted by Oberstein. See, everyone else tried to feed the dog with the spoils of their reformed government, but it wouldn't accept them, and only Oberstein knew what it actually wanted and needed to sate its hunger, get it?    I need to stress that I already love the ideas LOGH is playing with as this part of the story gets underway. It's a strong prompt for the audience, the question of if such a benevolent dictatorship is only preferable in comparison to the repression of the previous administration. We know from his past that Reinhard personally believes in the principles behind these reforms, but that's complicated by the fact that he's clearly also implementing them as a conscious power-play for uses he knows he'll need later. It's conceptually fascinating and stimulating – and it really is the sort of thing that works better in written form rather than trying to watch it play out as an episode of television. All the attractive background art in the world can't punch up the debate-club arguments that are, for the moment, only tangentially important to the progressing plot at hand. In that respect, LOGH DNT is lucky it does look nice and its ideas are actually salient, as so many other shows have been doomed by their lesser efforts attempting this similar staid structure.    That said, such a problem is possibly more pronounced in the 29th episode. Whereas the previous one was a demonstration of the effects of external politicking, this one turns its focus on internal politicking. Huge amounts of its exposition are focused on the reasoning for characters being put in particular command positions for what the actual narrative focus of this part of the story is: The modification and warping of Geiersberg Fortress to retake Iserlohn. I think there is something to appreciate in part of the setup here necessitating a recap of some of the events and status quo from earlier in the series (it has been a while, with several gaps, and LOGH isn't known for not having a lot going on). But that bleeds into the storytelling for the whole episode itself, as so much of it, similarly to that last one, consists of explanations of things that are happening, backed by characters explaining why it is happening. Again, some of the framing of the production looks nice, but compared to that dramatic Mittermeyer and Reuenthal plot, or the premiere Julian episode, this is definitely more the dry, over-explanatory LOGH preceded by its reputation.    It doesn't all have to be this way. Some of the framing material for this one goes the appreciable route of focusing on the families of characters. There's a check-in with Kempff, who will be commanding the Iserlohn-recapturing mission, and his wife and kids, with some reflection on his previous preference for participating in direct combat, and how his relative safety in a commanding position is appreciated in comparison to that. Then, at the end of the episode, we shift over to Yang and Julian visiting with Caselne and his family, prompting discussion of Yang's own seeming flippance towards his safety within and without the Alliance organization. It's strong stuff that both articulates a concept and characterizes the people in this story, but even these parts feel like 50% story recap and theoretical sociological discussions. The apex of this issue is the episode's attempts to focus on Reinhard; as the narration drones on about all the impact the preceding plots have had on his personality, complete with flowery metaphors, we simply watch him stone-facedly going about his business. It nearly comes off like an audio-book of the material at times, which is decidedly not the vibe you want a fancy theatrical animated adaptation to have.    So much of this is seeding for all those forthcoming plot lines, so it's necessary one way or the other. But LOGH can and has done better, in this incarnation and others. This comes off too much like the dry, impersonal handling of the material I know DNT has struggled with on and off through its history, exacerbated by the base story material still being strong, alongside flashes of more intimate personal potential. It reaches a 'hope for the best' apex, that the series' more effective dramatic elements from the episodes before these ones can intersect with the way the story has otherwise picked up, and deliver on the impact we know it's supposed to have once it gets going. Our thought experiments based on its political-theory debate prompts can't keep doing all the heavy lifting.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 16th 2022       My Happy Marriage Novel 1                     Synopsis:             Miyo Saimori is the eldest daughter of the noble Saimori family, but as the un-Gifted daughter of her father's despised first wife, she's treated like a servant by her stepmother and half-sister. When escape comes in the form of being offered in marriage to the infamously cold Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo barely has enough left in her to hope, assuming that because she lacks Spirit-Sight she'll be rejected and die on the streets as her parents intended. But contrary to everyone's expectations, Miyo is not universally loathed, and her betrothal offers her the most precious chance of all: to learn to stop hating herself.      Review:         Synopsis:        Miyo Saimori is the eldest daughter of the noble Saimori family, but as the un-Gifted daughter of her father's despised first wife, she's treated like a servant by her stepmother and half-sister. When escape comes in the form of being offered in marriage to the infamously cold Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo barely has enough left in her to hope, assuming that because she lacks Spirit-Sight she'll be rejected and die on the streets as her parents intended. But contrary to everyone's expectations, Miyo is not universally loathed, and her betrothal offers her the most precious chance of all: to learn to stop hating herself.     Review:            Set in an alternate version of the late Meiji or early Taisho era, My Happy Marriage is a fairly classic take on the Cinderella story – especially if you remember that in many, if not most, variants of that tale Cinderella's father is alive and well and just watching his second wife abuse his daughter. That's the life that Miyo Saimori has been living for almost all of her nineteen years; her parents were forced into an arranged marriage despite her father being in love with another woman, and when her mother died, her father quickly married his first love, upon which both he and his second wife transferred their anger onto Miyo. To make matters even worse, Miyo lacked the one quality that her parents were married for in the first place: a special power known as the Gift of Spirit-Sight. The birth of their child, Miyo's three-years-younger half-sister Kaya, certainly didn't help, and by the time Miyo turned ten she was more or less kicked out of a family circle that barely accepted her to begin with.    Plenty of light novel heroines start life in a similar fashion, with recent (in translation) examples being I'll Never Set Foot in That House Again! and A Fairy Tale for Wizards, but in most cases the torment ends the moment the heroine is rescued. That is not the case for this story, and Miyo's PTSD from the treatment she received at her family home is a major theme of the novel; just because she's no longer under the Saimori roof doesn't mean that she's magically cured of the trauma caused by years of emotional and physical abuse. While that can be hard to read, it's also a point in the book's favor because it gives Miyo something real to develop as a character. There's no magical fix for her emotional issues, as her fiancé and his elderly servant quickly find out. The only things that will help Miyo to heal are kindness and time, and while this doesn't necessarily make her the most engaging protagonist, it lends an appreciable thread of reality to this story of Grotesqueries (spirits and demons). Not that fantasy romances are strictly required to be realistic, but it's a good way to set My Happy Marriage apart from its brethren.    And it does have plenty of the hallmarks of fantasy romance that readers of the genre have come to expect. Mostly those are concentrated in Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo's fiancé. Physically gorgeous, Kiyoka has a reputation for being incredibly cold and possibly cruel. The most talented Gifted of his generation, he heads up a special army unit for Gifted soldiers, and his hard-working personality is often misinterpreted as curmudgeonly. Naturally, that's not the case – he's just really not good at things like “emotions” and “not working,” but his personality is such that few of the spoiled young noblewomen his father has affianced him to are bothered to see that. Since Miyo doesn't expect anyone to be nice to her, she's not bothered by his attitude – but he is upset by hers, which is cringing and fearful in every single interaction they have. Fortunately for the story, he's not stupid, and neither is Yurie, his longtime servant. The two of them quickly figure out that something was very wrong in the Saimori household when Miyo was living there, and from there they begin to take steps to help Miyo regain a sense of self-worth and confidence.    To say it's an uphill battle would be understating the matter, and in some ways this can feel like a very long short book. (It's under 200 pages.) While Miyo's beaten-down reactions and personality make absolutely perfect sense, they can be very difficult to read about because she is so damaged by her experiences. Whether you feel sorry for her, frustrated with all of the characters, or furious with her family (or all three with some bonus emotions thrown in for good measure), there are definitely times when putting down the book and walking away is the best way to finish reading it. It's a good, well-written story (despite the odd fact that the title and chapter titles are in first person while the text is in third person), but it's also as far from light and fluffy as you can get in a romance, and both the cheery title and the gorgeous cover illustration can make the darkness of the plot difficult to realize. It's worth sticking it out, but it's not always easy to do so.    That cover image is also the only illustration in the book. Author Akumi Agitogi is good enough that the novel is plenty visual even without the assistance of illustrations, and it's also not difficult to figure out the rough time period from clues given within the text, so this doesn't actually hinder reading. The world-building is also well done, with a familiar early twentieth century feel nicely offset by the few fantasy trappings that are worked in. Gifts are strictly psychic in nature, and there are some hints that Miyo may not be as Giftless as she is thought to be based on her mother's peculiar bloodline talents. There are also interesting ideas of Grotesqueries being a product of a pre-industrial society and Gifts being on their way out in a world that now has automobiles and other similar modern features, which is something that will hopefully continue to be developed in the next book(s).    My Happy Marriage isn't always an easy book, but it is a good one. Miyo's treatment at the hands of her family is appropriately horrible, Kiyoka is quietly dashing, and Miyo's slow growth into someone who knows she's not garbage is heartening, even if it is occasionally difficult to read about. It's not a light romance, but if you don't mind that, it's worth checking out.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B  + Beautiful cover, story has interesting world building and doesn't pull punches on the abuse Miyo undergoes. − Can be difficult to read at times because of Miyo's abuse.            discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story: Akumi Agitogi   Full encyclopedia details aboutMy Happy Marriage (light novel)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

Review:         Synopsis:        Miyo Saimori is the eldest daughter of the noble Saimori family, but as the un-Gifted daughter of her father's despised first wife, she's treated like a servant by her stepmother and half-sister. When escape comes in the form of being offered in marriage to the infamously cold Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo barely has enough left in her to hope, assuming that because she lacks Spirit-Sight she'll be rejected and die on the streets as her parents intended. But contrary to everyone's expectations, Miyo is not universally loathed, and her betrothal offers her the most precious chance of all: to learn to stop hating herself.     Review:            Set in an alternate version of the late Meiji or early Taisho era, My Happy Marriage is a fairly classic take on the Cinderella story – especially if you remember that in many, if not most, variants of that tale Cinderella's father is alive and well and just watching his second wife abuse his daughter. That's the life that Miyo Saimori has been living for almost all of her nineteen years; her parents were forced into an arranged marriage despite her father being in love with another woman, and when her mother died, her father quickly married his first love, upon which both he and his second wife transferred their anger onto Miyo. To make matters even worse, Miyo lacked the one quality that her parents were married for in the first place: a special power known as the Gift of Spirit-Sight. The birth of their child, Miyo's three-years-younger half-sister Kaya, certainly didn't help, and by the time Miyo turned ten she was more or less kicked out of a family circle that barely accepted her to begin with.    Plenty of light novel heroines start life in a similar fashion, with recent (in translation) examples being I'll Never Set Foot in That House Again! and A Fairy Tale for Wizards, but in most cases the torment ends the moment the heroine is rescued. That is not the case for this story, and Miyo's PTSD from the treatment she received at her family home is a major theme of the novel; just because she's no longer under the Saimori roof doesn't mean that she's magically cured of the trauma caused by years of emotional and physical abuse. While that can be hard to read, it's also a point in the book's favor because it gives Miyo something real to develop as a character. There's no magical fix for her emotional issues, as her fiancé and his elderly servant quickly find out. The only things that will help Miyo to heal are kindness and time, and while this doesn't necessarily make her the most engaging protagonist, it lends an appreciable thread of reality to this story of Grotesqueries (spirits and demons). Not that fantasy romances are strictly required to be realistic, but it's a good way to set My Happy Marriage apart from its brethren.    And it does have plenty of the hallmarks of fantasy romance that readers of the genre have come to expect. Mostly those are concentrated in Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo's fiancé. Physically gorgeous, Kiyoka has a reputation for being incredibly cold and possibly cruel. The most talented Gifted of his generation, he heads up a special army unit for Gifted soldiers, and his hard-working personality is often misinterpreted as curmudgeonly. Naturally, that's not the case – he's just really not good at things like “emotions” and “not working,” but his personality is such that few of the spoiled young noblewomen his father has affianced him to are bothered to see that. Since Miyo doesn't expect anyone to be nice to her, she's not bothered by his attitude – but he is upset by hers, which is cringing and fearful in every single interaction they have. Fortunately for the story, he's not stupid, and neither is Yurie, his longtime servant. The two of them quickly figure out that something was very wrong in the Saimori household when Miyo was living there, and from there they begin to take steps to help Miyo regain a sense of self-worth and confidence.    To say it's an uphill battle would be understating the matter, and in some ways this can feel like a very long short book. (It's under 200 pages.) While Miyo's beaten-down reactions and personality make absolutely perfect sense, they can be very difficult to read about because she is so damaged by her experiences. Whether you feel sorry for her, frustrated with all of the characters, or furious with her family (or all three with some bonus emotions thrown in for good measure), there are definitely times when putting down the book and walking away is the best way to finish reading it. It's a good, well-written story (despite the odd fact that the title and chapter titles are in first person while the text is in third person), but it's also as far from light and fluffy as you can get in a romance, and both the cheery title and the gorgeous cover illustration can make the darkness of the plot difficult to realize. It's worth sticking it out, but it's not always easy to do so.    That cover image is also the only illustration in the book. Author Akumi Agitogi is good enough that the novel is plenty visual even without the assistance of illustrations, and it's also not difficult to figure out the rough time period from clues given within the text, so this doesn't actually hinder reading. The world-building is also well done, with a familiar early twentieth century feel nicely offset by the few fantasy trappings that are worked in. Gifts are strictly psychic in nature, and there are some hints that Miyo may not be as Giftless as she is thought to be based on her mother's peculiar bloodline talents. There are also interesting ideas of Grotesqueries being a product of a pre-industrial society and Gifts being on their way out in a world that now has automobiles and other similar modern features, which is something that will hopefully continue to be developed in the next book(s).    My Happy Marriage isn't always an easy book, but it is a good one. Miyo's treatment at the hands of her family is appropriately horrible, Kiyoka is quietly dashing, and Miyo's slow growth into someone who knows she's not garbage is heartening, even if it is occasionally difficult to read about. It's not a light romance, but if you don't mind that, it's worth checking out.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B  + Beautiful cover, story has interesting world building and doesn't pull punches on the abuse Miyo undergoes. − Can be difficult to read at times because of Miyo's abuse.            discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story: Akumi Agitogi   Full encyclopedia details aboutMy Happy Marriage (light novel)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 16th 2022       My Happy Marriage Novel 1                     Synopsis:             Miyo Saimori is the eldest daughter of the noble Saimori family, but as the un-Gifted daughter of her father's despised first wife, she's treated like a servant by her stepmother and half-sister. When escape comes in the form of being offered in marriage to the infamously cold Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo barely has enough left in her to hope, assuming that because she lacks Spirit-Sight she'll be rejected and die on the streets as her parents intended. But contrary to everyone's expectations, Miyo is not universally loathed, and her betrothal offers her the most precious chance of all: to learn to stop hating herself.      Review:         Synopsis:        Miyo Saimori is the eldest daughter of the noble Saimori family, but as the un-Gifted daughter of her father's despised first wife, she's treated like a servant by her stepmother and half-sister. When escape comes in the form of being offered in marriage to the infamously cold Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo barely has enough left in her to hope, assuming that because she lacks Spirit-Sight she'll be rejected and die on the streets as her parents intended. But contrary to everyone's expectations, Miyo is not universally loathed, and her betrothal offers her the most precious chance of all: to learn to stop hating herself.     Review:            Set in an alternate version of the late Meiji or early Taisho era, My Happy Marriage is a fairly classic take on the Cinderella story – especially if you remember that in many, if not most, variants of that tale Cinderella's father is alive and well and just watching his second wife abuse his daughter. That's the life that Miyo Saimori has been living for almost all of her nineteen years; her parents were forced into an arranged marriage despite her father being in love with another woman, and when her mother died, her father quickly married his first love, upon which both he and his second wife transferred their anger onto Miyo. To make matters even worse, Miyo lacked the one quality that her parents were married for in the first place: a special power known as the Gift of Spirit-Sight. The birth of their child, Miyo's three-years-younger half-sister Kaya, certainly didn't help, and by the time Miyo turned ten she was more or less kicked out of a family circle that barely accepted her to begin with.    Plenty of light novel heroines start life in a similar fashion, with recent (in translation) examples being I'll Never Set Foot in That House Again! and A Fairy Tale for Wizards, but in most cases the torment ends the moment the heroine is rescued. That is not the case for this story, and Miyo's PTSD from the treatment she received at her family home is a major theme of the novel; just because she's no longer under the Saimori roof doesn't mean that she's magically cured of the trauma caused by years of emotional and physical abuse. While that can be hard to read, it's also a point in the book's favor because it gives Miyo something real to develop as a character. There's no magical fix for her emotional issues, as her fiancé and his elderly servant quickly find out. The only things that will help Miyo to heal are kindness and time, and while this doesn't necessarily make her the most engaging protagonist, it lends an appreciable thread of reality to this story of Grotesqueries (spirits and demons). Not that fantasy romances are strictly required to be realistic, but it's a good way to set My Happy Marriage apart from its brethren.    And it does have plenty of the hallmarks of fantasy romance that readers of the genre have come to expect. Mostly those are concentrated in Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo's fiancé. Physically gorgeous, Kiyoka has a reputation for being incredibly cold and possibly cruel. The most talented Gifted of his generation, he heads up a special army unit for Gifted soldiers, and his hard-working personality is often misinterpreted as curmudgeonly. Naturally, that's not the case – he's just really not good at things like “emotions” and “not working,” but his personality is such that few of the spoiled young noblewomen his father has affianced him to are bothered to see that. Since Miyo doesn't expect anyone to be nice to her, she's not bothered by his attitude – but he is upset by hers, which is cringing and fearful in every single interaction they have. Fortunately for the story, he's not stupid, and neither is Yurie, his longtime servant. The two of them quickly figure out that something was very wrong in the Saimori household when Miyo was living there, and from there they begin to take steps to help Miyo regain a sense of self-worth and confidence.    To say it's an uphill battle would be understating the matter, and in some ways this can feel like a very long short book. (It's under 200 pages.) While Miyo's beaten-down reactions and personality make absolutely perfect sense, they can be very difficult to read about because she is so damaged by her experiences. Whether you feel sorry for her, frustrated with all of the characters, or furious with her family (or all three with some bonus emotions thrown in for good measure), there are definitely times when putting down the book and walking away is the best way to finish reading it. It's a good, well-written story (despite the odd fact that the title and chapter titles are in first person while the text is in third person), but it's also as far from light and fluffy as you can get in a romance, and both the cheery title and the gorgeous cover illustration can make the darkness of the plot difficult to realize. It's worth sticking it out, but it's not always easy to do so.    That cover image is also the only illustration in the book. Author Akumi Agitogi is good enough that the novel is plenty visual even without the assistance of illustrations, and it's also not difficult to figure out the rough time period from clues given within the text, so this doesn't actually hinder reading. The world-building is also well done, with a familiar early twentieth century feel nicely offset by the few fantasy trappings that are worked in. Gifts are strictly psychic in nature, and there are some hints that Miyo may not be as Giftless as she is thought to be based on her mother's peculiar bloodline talents. There are also interesting ideas of Grotesqueries being a product of a pre-industrial society and Gifts being on their way out in a world that now has automobiles and other similar modern features, which is something that will hopefully continue to be developed in the next book(s).    My Happy Marriage isn't always an easy book, but it is a good one. Miyo's treatment at the hands of her family is appropriately horrible, Kiyoka is quietly dashing, and Miyo's slow growth into someone who knows she's not garbage is heartening, even if it is occasionally difficult to read about. It's not a light romance, but if you don't mind that, it's worth checking out.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B  + Beautiful cover, story has interesting world building and doesn't pull punches on the abuse Miyo undergoes. − Can be difficult to read at times because of Miyo's abuse.            discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story: Akumi Agitogi   Full encyclopedia details aboutMy Happy Marriage (light novel)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 16th 2022       My Happy Marriage Novel 1                     Synopsis:             Miyo Saimori is the eldest daughter of the noble Saimori family, but as the un-Gifted daughter of her father's despised first wife, she's treated like a servant by her stepmother and half-sister. When escape comes in the form of being offered in marriage to the infamously cold Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo barely has enough left in her to hope, assuming that because she lacks Spirit-Sight she'll be rejected and die on the streets as her parents intended. But contrary to everyone's expectations, Miyo is not universally loathed, and her betrothal offers her the most precious chance of all: to learn to stop hating herself.      Review:         Synopsis:        Miyo Saimori is the eldest daughter of the noble Saimori family, but as the un-Gifted daughter of her father's despised first wife, she's treated like a servant by her stepmother and half-sister. When escape comes in the form of being offered in marriage to the infamously cold Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo barely has enough left in her to hope, assuming that because she lacks Spirit-Sight she'll be rejected and die on the streets as her parents intended. But contrary to everyone's expectations, Miyo is not universally loathed, and her betrothal offers her the most precious chance of all: to learn to stop hating herself.     Review:            Set in an alternate version of the late Meiji or early Taisho era, My Happy Marriage is a fairly classic take on the Cinderella story – especially if you remember that in many, if not most, variants of that tale Cinderella's father is alive and well and just watching his second wife abuse his daughter. That's the life that Miyo Saimori has been living for almost all of her nineteen years; her parents were forced into an arranged marriage despite her father being in love with another woman, and when her mother died, her father quickly married his first love, upon which both he and his second wife transferred their anger onto Miyo. To make matters even worse, Miyo lacked the one quality that her parents were married for in the first place: a special power known as the Gift of Spirit-Sight. The birth of their child, Miyo's three-years-younger half-sister Kaya, certainly didn't help, and by the time Miyo turned ten she was more or less kicked out of a family circle that barely accepted her to begin with.    Plenty of light novel heroines start life in a similar fashion, with recent (in translation) examples being I'll Never Set Foot in That House Again! and A Fairy Tale for Wizards, but in most cases the torment ends the moment the heroine is rescued. That is not the case for this story, and Miyo's PTSD from the treatment she received at her family home is a major theme of the novel; just because she's no longer under the Saimori roof doesn't mean that she's magically cured of the trauma caused by years of emotional and physical abuse. While that can be hard to read, it's also a point in the book's favor because it gives Miyo something real to develop as a character. There's no magical fix for her emotional issues, as her fiancé and his elderly servant quickly find out. The only things that will help Miyo to heal are kindness and time, and while this doesn't necessarily make her the most engaging protagonist, it lends an appreciable thread of reality to this story of Grotesqueries (spirits and demons). Not that fantasy romances are strictly required to be realistic, but it's a good way to set My Happy Marriage apart from its brethren.    And it does have plenty of the hallmarks of fantasy romance that readers of the genre have come to expect. Mostly those are concentrated in Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo's fiancé. Physically gorgeous, Kiyoka has a reputation for being incredibly cold and possibly cruel. The most talented Gifted of his generation, he heads up a special army unit for Gifted soldiers, and his hard-working personality is often misinterpreted as curmudgeonly. Naturally, that's not the case – he's just really not good at things like “emotions” and “not working,” but his personality is such that few of the spoiled young noblewomen his father has affianced him to are bothered to see that. Since Miyo doesn't expect anyone to be nice to her, she's not bothered by his attitude – but he is upset by hers, which is cringing and fearful in every single interaction they have. Fortunately for the story, he's not stupid, and neither is Yurie, his longtime servant. The two of them quickly figure out that something was very wrong in the Saimori household when Miyo was living there, and from there they begin to take steps to help Miyo regain a sense of self-worth and confidence.    To say it's an uphill battle would be understating the matter, and in some ways this can feel like a very long short book. (It's under 200 pages.) While Miyo's beaten-down reactions and personality make absolutely perfect sense, they can be very difficult to read about because she is so damaged by her experiences. Whether you feel sorry for her, frustrated with all of the characters, or furious with her family (or all three with some bonus emotions thrown in for good measure), there are definitely times when putting down the book and walking away is the best way to finish reading it. It's a good, well-written story (despite the odd fact that the title and chapter titles are in first person while the text is in third person), but it's also as far from light and fluffy as you can get in a romance, and both the cheery title and the gorgeous cover illustration can make the darkness of the plot difficult to realize. It's worth sticking it out, but it's not always easy to do so.    That cover image is also the only illustration in the book. Author Akumi Agitogi is good enough that the novel is plenty visual even without the assistance of illustrations, and it's also not difficult to figure out the rough time period from clues given within the text, so this doesn't actually hinder reading. The world-building is also well done, with a familiar early twentieth century feel nicely offset by the few fantasy trappings that are worked in. Gifts are strictly psychic in nature, and there are some hints that Miyo may not be as Giftless as she is thought to be based on her mother's peculiar bloodline talents. There are also interesting ideas of Grotesqueries being a product of a pre-industrial society and Gifts being on their way out in a world that now has automobiles and other similar modern features, which is something that will hopefully continue to be developed in the next book(s).    My Happy Marriage isn't always an easy book, but it is a good one. Miyo's treatment at the hands of her family is appropriately horrible, Kiyoka is quietly dashing, and Miyo's slow growth into someone who knows she's not garbage is heartening, even if it is occasionally difficult to read about. It's not a light romance, but if you don't mind that, it's worth checking out.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B  + Beautiful cover, story has interesting world building and doesn't pull punches on the abuse Miyo undergoes. − Can be difficult to read at times because of Miyo's abuse.            discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story: Akumi Agitogi   Full encyclopedia details aboutMy Happy Marriage (light novel)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

PREVIEW: The Mecha Action-Shooter Gundam Evolution   by Jean-Karlo Lemus, Apr 14th 2022          The Gundam universe has no shortage of video game adaptations, and this past week saw the five-day-long network test for Bandai Namco's newest take on the storied franchise. Gundam Evolution stands poised to be the franchise's first-ever free-to-play shooter. We were allowed to take part in the network test for the Steam version of the game and experience it first-hand.     As the title implies, players operate as specific mobile suits from across the Gundam franchise. The selection of mech units is surprisingly eclectic: while the traditional RX-78-2 Mobile Suit is of course selectable, armed with its beam cannon and hammer, players can also control the Turn ∀  Gundam, the Gundam Exia, the Barbatos Gundam, and even non-Gundam units like the Guntank, the Zaku II, and the Dom. Each unit controls more or less the same, with the main differences being the nature of their weapons and their skills: while most units like the RX-78 focus on ranged weapons, some units like the Barbatos or the Exia focus on melee attacks. Being mechs, each unit has thrusters that allow for dashes, boosts, and hovering, adding lots of complexity to movement. Each unit also features two unique skills with cooldowns, and a chargeable G-maneuver that unleashes a special skill. During our playtime, we specialized in the Turn ∀ Gundam, which featured a charge shot for their beam canon, a personal healing skill, and a grappling attack. In all, there are 14 playable units.    Gundam Evolution's network test consisted of simple online ranked matches where teams of six compete against each other. Three gameplay modes will be featured in the full game: Point Capture, Domination, and Destruction. Each mode features teams alternating between Attackers and Defenders, tasked with either carrying out specific objectives or preventing the opposing team from carrying them out. Domination requires Attackers to capture one of three randomly-spawning objectives, Destruction requires charging a bomb at a point on the map until it detonates the point, and Point Capture involves simply occupying a point on the map in order to score points. During our time in the Network Test, we only experienced Point Capture. We also only tested out one map, but there was no shortage of excitement to be had. Further gameplay modes have been promised in the future following the full release of the title.     Matches are a good mix of hectic chaos and tense anticipation. A lack of awareness will get you destroyed in short order, thus a keen eye and quick reflexes are essential to survival. It's possible to rescue downed units before they're destroyed, albeit at the risk of leaving yourself open to attackers that are no doubt still in the area. Capture points quickly become heated clashes between teams as they're contested, the ebb and flow of the match varying as units are shot down or respawn to rejoin the fray. A well-balanced match can easily run into overtime as both teams struggle for a foothold above the other. The connections were stable, however we did experience a drop from the network during one particularly heated match. With Gundam Evolution still being tested and refined, we can hope that this problem will be smoothed over.    Gundam Evolution is free-to-play and features an in-game cash shop, as well as a battle pass, alternate skins, and player icons. Old Gundams can be customized with snazzy recolors, while players can set their profile pictures to images of beloved Gundam characters like Amuro Ray or Char Aznable. Skins can also be earned by leveling up with your battle pass; the network test featured an exclusive skin for the RX-78 attainable upon reaching level 20. For the most part, skins seem to be available through a lootbox system, which players buy into via tickets earned from the cash shop or from in-game awards.     In all, Gundam Evolution's network test was a success. While some network issues interrupted the fun and the looming threat of a lootbox system shadows the game, the moment-to-moment gameplay is fun and frantic and the sheer fanservice of zipping through the map as the White Devil, complete with classic Gundam sound effects, is undeniably charming. While a definite release date has yet to be set, players can look forward to Gundam Evolution's release later this year on PS4, Xbox One, PS5, Xbox Series S and X, and Steam.     discuss this in the forum (5 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

PREVIEW: The Mecha Action-Shooter Gundam Evolution   by Jean-Karlo Lemus, Apr 14th 2022          The Gundam universe has no shortage of video game adaptations, and this past week saw the five-day-long network test for Bandai Namco's newest take on the storied franchise. Gundam Evolution stands poised to be the franchise's first-ever free-to-play shooter. We were allowed to take part in the network test for the Steam version of the game and experience it first-hand.     As the title implies, players operate as specific mobile suits from across the Gundam franchise. The selection of mech units is surprisingly eclectic: while the traditional RX-78-2 Mobile Suit is of course selectable, armed with its beam cannon and hammer, players can also control the Turn ∀  Gundam, the Gundam Exia, the Barbatos Gundam, and even non-Gundam units like the Guntank, the Zaku II, and the Dom. Each unit controls more or less the same, with the main differences being the nature of their weapons and their skills: while most units like the RX-78 focus on ranged weapons, some units like the Barbatos or the Exia focus on melee attacks. Being mechs, each unit has thrusters that allow for dashes, boosts, and hovering, adding lots of complexity to movement. Each unit also features two unique skills with cooldowns, and a chargeable G-maneuver that unleashes a special skill. During our playtime, we specialized in the Turn ∀ Gundam, which featured a charge shot for their beam canon, a personal healing skill, and a grappling attack. In all, there are 14 playable units.    Gundam Evolution's network test consisted of simple online ranked matches where teams of six compete against each other. Three gameplay modes will be featured in the full game: Point Capture, Domination, and Destruction. Each mode features teams alternating between Attackers and Defenders, tasked with either carrying out specific objectives or preventing the opposing team from carrying them out. Domination requires Attackers to capture one of three randomly-spawning objectives, Destruction requires charging a bomb at a point on the map until it detonates the point, and Point Capture involves simply occupying a point on the map in order to score points. During our time in the Network Test, we only experienced Point Capture. We also only tested out one map, but there was no shortage of excitement to be had. Further gameplay modes have been promised in the future following the full release of the title.     Matches are a good mix of hectic chaos and tense anticipation. A lack of awareness will get you destroyed in short order, thus a keen eye and quick reflexes are essential to survival. It's possible to rescue downed units before they're destroyed, albeit at the risk of leaving yourself open to attackers that are no doubt still in the area. Capture points quickly become heated clashes between teams as they're contested, the ebb and flow of the match varying as units are shot down or respawn to rejoin the fray. A well-balanced match can easily run into overtime as both teams struggle for a foothold above the other. The connections were stable, however we did experience a drop from the network during one particularly heated match. With Gundam Evolution still being tested and refined, we can hope that this problem will be smoothed over.    Gundam Evolution is free-to-play and features an in-game cash shop, as well as a battle pass, alternate skins, and player icons. Old Gundams can be customized with snazzy recolors, while players can set their profile pictures to images of beloved Gundam characters like Amuro Ray or Char Aznable. Skins can also be earned by leveling up with your battle pass; the network test featured an exclusive skin for the RX-78 attainable upon reaching level 20. For the most part, skins seem to be available through a lootbox system, which players buy into via tickets earned from the cash shop or from in-game awards.     In all, Gundam Evolution's network test was a success. While some network issues interrupted the fun and the looming threat of a lootbox system shadows the game, the moment-to-moment gameplay is fun and frantic and the sheer fanservice of zipping through the map as the White Devil, complete with classic Gundam sound effects, is undeniably charming. While a definite release date has yet to be set, players can look forward to Gundam Evolution's release later this year on PS4, Xbox One, PS5, Xbox Series S and X, and Steam.     discuss this in the forum (5 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

PREVIEW: The Mecha Action-Shooter Gundam Evolution   by Jean-Karlo Lemus, Apr 14th 2022          The Gundam universe has no shortage of video game adaptations, and this past week saw the five-day-long network test for Bandai Namco's newest take on the storied franchise. Gundam Evolution stands poised to be the franchise's first-ever free-to-play shooter. We were allowed to take part in the network test for the Steam version of the game and experience it first-hand.     As the title implies, players operate as specific mobile suits from across the Gundam franchise. The selection of mech units is surprisingly eclectic: while the traditional RX-78-2 Mobile Suit is of course selectable, armed with its beam cannon and hammer, players can also control the Turn ∀  Gundam, the Gundam Exia, the Barbatos Gundam, and even non-Gundam units like the Guntank, the Zaku II, and the Dom. Each unit controls more or less the same, with the main differences being the nature of their weapons and their skills: while most units like the RX-78 focus on ranged weapons, some units like the Barbatos or the Exia focus on melee attacks. Being mechs, each unit has thrusters that allow for dashes, boosts, and hovering, adding lots of complexity to movement. Each unit also features two unique skills with cooldowns, and a chargeable G-maneuver that unleashes a special skill. During our playtime, we specialized in the Turn ∀ Gundam, which featured a charge shot for their beam canon, a personal healing skill, and a grappling attack. In all, there are 14 playable units.    Gundam Evolution's network test consisted of simple online ranked matches where teams of six compete against each other. Three gameplay modes will be featured in the full game: Point Capture, Domination, and Destruction. Each mode features teams alternating between Attackers and Defenders, tasked with either carrying out specific objectives or preventing the opposing team from carrying them out. Domination requires Attackers to capture one of three randomly-spawning objectives, Destruction requires charging a bomb at a point on the map until it detonates the point, and Point Capture involves simply occupying a point on the map in order to score points. During our time in the Network Test, we only experienced Point Capture. We also only tested out one map, but there was no shortage of excitement to be had. Further gameplay modes have been promised in the future following the full release of the title.     Matches are a good mix of hectic chaos and tense anticipation. A lack of awareness will get you destroyed in short order, thus a keen eye and quick reflexes are essential to survival. It's possible to rescue downed units before they're destroyed, albeit at the risk of leaving yourself open to attackers that are no doubt still in the area. Capture points quickly become heated clashes between teams as they're contested, the ebb and flow of the match varying as units are shot down or respawn to rejoin the fray. A well-balanced match can easily run into overtime as both teams struggle for a foothold above the other. The connections were stable, however we did experience a drop from the network during one particularly heated match. With Gundam Evolution still being tested and refined, we can hope that this problem will be smoothed over.    Gundam Evolution is free-to-play and features an in-game cash shop, as well as a battle pass, alternate skins, and player icons. Old Gundams can be customized with snazzy recolors, while players can set their profile pictures to images of beloved Gundam characters like Amuro Ray or Char Aznable. Skins can also be earned by leveling up with your battle pass; the network test featured an exclusive skin for the RX-78 attainable upon reaching level 20. For the most part, skins seem to be available through a lootbox system, which players buy into via tickets earned from the cash shop or from in-game awards.     In all, Gundam Evolution's network test was a success. While some network issues interrupted the fun and the looming threat of a lootbox system shadows the game, the moment-to-moment gameplay is fun and frantic and the sheer fanservice of zipping through the map as the White Devil, complete with classic Gundam sound effects, is undeniably charming. While a definite release date has yet to be set, players can look forward to Gundam Evolution's release later this year on PS4, Xbox One, PS5, Xbox Series S and X, and Steam.     discuss this in the forum (5 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tomodachi Game   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tomodachi Game   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tomodachi Game   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tomodachi Game   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation.

However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times.

Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game.

Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times.

(That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.

20-04-2022,anime,6,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/tomodachi-game/.183523,Tomodachi Game - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them.

Delicious Party Precure Episode 6  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 6 of Delicious Party♡Precure ?                     Community score: 4.4            It's back! Delicious Party♡Precure has returned to remind everyone that you need to be careful on social media, because you never know if the bad guys are going to follow your Instagram feed to pick their targets. It's actually kind of a clever way to more fully introduce the girl who will become Cure Yum-Yum next week – we've seen her in most episodes, she sits between Yui and Kokone in class, but apart from that, there's not really been any good reason for her to join the team. Not that that's a necessity, but it does feel like just another way this iteration of the franchise is doing a particularly good job: she has to be Cure Yum-Yum because she's inadvertently been involved in what's going on from the beginning.    That little revelation aside, this is another very solid episode that continues the work of developing Kokone. Yui's a great character and I love that she attacks Ubau-zo with whatever she's got to hand since she can't transform until Mari shows up with Kome-Kome, but Kokone has a lot more going on internally. Yui is the first real friend she's ever had, and it's clear that she's having a hard time adjusting to what that means. While she's not overtly over-enthusiastic, we still see the markers of her joy and worry. The basket of unending sandwiches is a very good indicator of her emotions: it's obviously overkill, but it's just as clearly the only way she can really think of to show Yui that she appreciates and admires her – by using the skill Yui taught her to make her a gift. And if we consider that Kokone's lived in what looks an awful lot like excess (at least for one kid), she doesn't know any other way to do things. The little bento of prosciutto-wrapped melon is her attempting to do something even more special and to share some of what she knows with Yui. I'm not 100% sure that she doesn't have a bit of a crush on Yui as well, but if she does, who could blame her – the way that Yui treats her as a person while everyone else at school acts as if she's royalty made of blown-glass is in some ways even more important than their shared job of protecting the town.    Though their duty as Pretty Cures does help with Kokone's friend-making skills too. While Yui is attacking the salad spinner monster with a soccer ball, Kokone's equally busy, and it's through her actions that she shows the other girls that she's not that different from them. Being a magical girl has given Kokone the courage to step up, and that's really what I love about the genre – it's empowering in the way that it shows that while having magical powers can help, it's really about the power inside yourself that's the most important. Magical girls need to care before they transform, and in some ways that's what enables the transformation in the first place. Certainly the girls' inner strength attracted Kome-Kome and Pam-Pam, and I'd argue that it even helped Mari to come out of his slump. In Kokone's case, it's an ongoing give-and-take – her transformation is possible because of the reserves of strength she has, and that strength can come out because she's shown her own possibilities via transformation.    All of this builds on the previous episodes, but also the tongue-in-cheek use of the old-school rumor trope. The girls' school may not have seven school mysteries (yet), but watching the rumor about the monster in the home ec room (which uses the myth of the tsukumogami as its root, a great touch, especially since one girl heard it from her grandmother) spread completely out of control is one of the most realistic middle school moments I've seen recently. That's exactly how those things happen, and a shout-out to that one kid who counters “It has 7,000 teeth!” with “Isn't that too many?”    How Cure Yum-Yum fits into Kokone's growth, the overall battle, and a potential plotline about social media is going to start to come clear next week. Whether or not she also thinks that 7,000 teeth on a kettle monster is too many remains to be seen, but either way, I'm excited to see what she brings to the story.

Delicious Party Precure Episode 6  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 6 of Delicious Party♡Precure ?                     Community score: 4.4            It's back! Delicious Party♡Precure has returned to remind everyone that you need to be careful on social media, because you never know if the bad guys are going to follow your Instagram feed to pick their targets. It's actually kind of a clever way to more fully introduce the girl who will become Cure Yum-Yum next week – we've seen her in most episodes, she sits between Yui and Kokone in class, but apart from that, there's not really been any good reason for her to join the team. Not that that's a necessity, but it does feel like just another way this iteration of the franchise is doing a particularly good job: she has to be Cure Yum-Yum because she's inadvertently been involved in what's going on from the beginning.    That little revelation aside, this is another very solid episode that continues the work of developing Kokone. Yui's a great character and I love that she attacks Ubau-zo with whatever she's got to hand since she can't transform until Mari shows up with Kome-Kome, but Kokone has a lot more going on internally. Yui is the first real friend she's ever had, and it's clear that she's having a hard time adjusting to what that means. While she's not overtly over-enthusiastic, we still see the markers of her joy and worry. The basket of unending sandwiches is a very good indicator of her emotions: it's obviously overkill, but it's just as clearly the only way she can really think of to show Yui that she appreciates and admires her – by using the skill Yui taught her to make her a gift. And if we consider that Kokone's lived in what looks an awful lot like excess (at least for one kid), she doesn't know any other way to do things. The little bento of prosciutto-wrapped melon is her attempting to do something even more special and to share some of what she knows with Yui. I'm not 100% sure that she doesn't have a bit of a crush on Yui as well, but if she does, who could blame her – the way that Yui treats her as a person while everyone else at school acts as if she's royalty made of blown-glass is in some ways even more important than their shared job of protecting the town.    Though their duty as Pretty Cures does help with Kokone's friend-making skills too. While Yui is attacking the salad spinner monster with a soccer ball, Kokone's equally busy, and it's through her actions that she shows the other girls that she's not that different from them. Being a magical girl has given Kokone the courage to step up, and that's really what I love about the genre – it's empowering in the way that it shows that while having magical powers can help, it's really about the power inside yourself that's the most important. Magical girls need to care before they transform, and in some ways that's what enables the transformation in the first place. Certainly the girls' inner strength attracted Kome-Kome and Pam-Pam, and I'd argue that it even helped Mari to come out of his slump. In Kokone's case, it's an ongoing give-and-take – her transformation is possible because of the reserves of strength she has, and that strength can come out because she's shown her own possibilities via transformation.    All of this builds on the previous episodes, but also the tongue-in-cheek use of the old-school rumor trope. The girls' school may not have seven school mysteries (yet), but watching the rumor about the monster in the home ec room (which uses the myth of the tsukumogami as its root, a great touch, especially since one girl heard it from her grandmother) spread completely out of control is one of the most realistic middle school moments I've seen recently. That's exactly how those things happen, and a shout-out to that one kid who counters “It has 7,000 teeth!” with “Isn't that too many?”    How Cure Yum-Yum fits into Kokone's growth, the overall battle, and a potential plotline about social media is going to start to come clear next week. Whether or not she also thinks that 7,000 teeth on a kettle monster is too many remains to be seen, but either way, I'm excited to see what she brings to the story.

Delicious Party Precure Episode 6  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 6 of Delicious Party♡Precure ?                     Community score: 4.4            It's back! Delicious Party♡Precure has returned to remind everyone that you need to be careful on social media, because you never know if the bad guys are going to follow your Instagram feed to pick their targets. It's actually kind of a clever way to more fully introduce the girl who will become Cure Yum-Yum next week – we've seen her in most episodes, she sits between Yui and Kokone in class, but apart from that, there's not really been any good reason for her to join the team. Not that that's a necessity, but it does feel like just another way this iteration of the franchise is doing a particularly good job: she has to be Cure Yum-Yum because she's inadvertently been involved in what's going on from the beginning.    That little revelation aside, this is another very solid episode that continues the work of developing Kokone. Yui's a great character and I love that she attacks Ubau-zo with whatever she's got to hand since she can't transform until Mari shows up with Kome-Kome, but Kokone has a lot more going on internally. Yui is the first real friend she's ever had, and it's clear that she's having a hard time adjusting to what that means. While she's not overtly over-enthusiastic, we still see the markers of her joy and worry. The basket of unending sandwiches is a very good indicator of her emotions: it's obviously overkill, but it's just as clearly the only way she can really think of to show Yui that she appreciates and admires her – by using the skill Yui taught her to make her a gift. And if we consider that Kokone's lived in what looks an awful lot like excess (at least for one kid), she doesn't know any other way to do things. The little bento of prosciutto-wrapped melon is her attempting to do something even more special and to share some of what she knows with Yui. I'm not 100% sure that she doesn't have a bit of a crush on Yui as well, but if she does, who could blame her – the way that Yui treats her as a person while everyone else at school acts as if she's royalty made of blown-glass is in some ways even more important than their shared job of protecting the town.    Though their duty as Pretty Cures does help with Kokone's friend-making skills too. While Yui is attacking the salad spinner monster with a soccer ball, Kokone's equally busy, and it's through her actions that she shows the other girls that she's not that different from them. Being a magical girl has given Kokone the courage to step up, and that's really what I love about the genre – it's empowering in the way that it shows that while having magical powers can help, it's really about the power inside yourself that's the most important. Magical girls need to care before they transform, and in some ways that's what enables the transformation in the first place. Certainly the girls' inner strength attracted Kome-Kome and Pam-Pam, and I'd argue that it even helped Mari to come out of his slump. In Kokone's case, it's an ongoing give-and-take – her transformation is possible because of the reserves of strength she has, and that strength can come out because she's shown her own possibilities via transformation.    All of this builds on the previous episodes, but also the tongue-in-cheek use of the old-school rumor trope. The girls' school may not have seven school mysteries (yet), but watching the rumor about the monster in the home ec room (which uses the myth of the tsukumogami as its root, a great touch, especially since one girl heard it from her grandmother) spread completely out of control is one of the most realistic middle school moments I've seen recently. That's exactly how those things happen, and a shout-out to that one kid who counters “It has 7,000 teeth!” with “Isn't that too many?”    How Cure Yum-Yum fits into Kokone's growth, the overall battle, and a potential plotline about social media is going to start to come clear next week. Whether or not she also thinks that 7,000 teeth on a kettle monster is too many remains to be seen, but either way, I'm excited to see what she brings to the story.

News Ultraman 3D CG Anime Gets Final Season in 2023   posted on 2022-04-18 22:13 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Trailer, visual unveiled for anime debuting worldwide on Netflix     Tsuburaya Productions revealed on Monday that the 3D CG anime Eiichi Shimizu and Tomohiro Shimoguchi's Ultraman manga will get a final season that will debut worldwide on Netflix in 2023. The company streamed a teaser trailer:      In the trailer, Ultraman narrator Kōji Ishizaka shouts ""Ultraman, stand up!"" The video ends with the line, ""There is one more response from Ultraman.""    The company also unveiled an visual. The text on the right reads, ""Farewell, Ultraman.""     The anime's second season debuted on Netflix worldwide on April 14. The new season's first episode got an advanced screening at the ""Ultraman World Premiere and Orchestra Concert"" event on April 10.    Netflix describes the anime's story:  Several years have passed since the events of Ultraman, with the legendary ""Giant of Light"" (光の巨人 Hikari no Kyojin) now a memory, as it is believed he returned home after fighting the many giant aliens that invaded the Earth. Shin Hayata's son Shinjiro seems to possess a strange ability, and it is this ability, along with his father's revelation that he was Ultraman, that leads Shinjiro to battle the new aliens invading the Earth as the new Ultraman.  The first anime season premiered globally on Netflix in April 2019 and has 13 episodes. The series then premiered on television in Japan in April 2020. Kenji Kamiyama (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Eden of the East, Napping Princess) and Shinji Aramaki (Appleseed, Harlock: Space Pirate, Starship Troopers: Traitor of Mars) directed the first anime season. Production I.G (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Eden of the East, Napping Princess) and Sola Digital Arts (Appleseed Alpha, Starship Troopers: Invasion, Starship Troopers: Traitor of Mars) produced the anime in 3D CG. Nobuko Toda and Kazuma Jinnouchi composed the music.    Kamiyama, Aramaki, Production I.G, and Sola Digital Arts returned from the first season for the second one.    Tatsuhisa Suzuki was slated to play the new Ultraman character Kōtarō Higashi/Ultraman Taro  in the second season, but he offered to step down from the role, due to his recent hiatus from ""all entertainment industry activities"" last year. Tomoaki Maeno will voice the character instead. Suzuki performed the opening theme songs for the first season as a member of OLDCODEX.
